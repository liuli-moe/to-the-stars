## To the Ground 

> The extended aftermath of the Unification Wars brought major changes in the organization of the rapidly demobilizing military, brought about by a combination of changing circumstances and new technology.
>
> Firstly, new direct‐to‐cortex training techniques greatly shortened the amount of time necessary to train all classes of military personnel, including officers, making it possible for lower‐ranked personnel to obtain basic training for higher positions with relatively little effort. Secondly, the steeply rising education level of the overall populace nearly eliminated the poorly‐educated soldiers that had traditionally comprised the lower ranks of the military, further contributing to a glut of qualified promotion candidates. Finally, the end of conscription and the return of the volunteer military eliminated a plausible reason for holding some candidates back.
>
> As a result of these developments, the officer corps underwent significant post‐bellum reform. The most dramatic was the elimination of the distinction between commissioned officers and the rest of the soldiery, based on the reasoning that the necessary \"book‐learning\" that went into commissions could now be compressed into the relatively short span of a few weeks. Accompanying this change was a sharp increase in the meritocratic nature of the command structure; any soldier who displayed unusual command ability or potential could be lifted easily out of the lower ranks, given relatively brief additional training, and be deployed back into the field as an officer. At the same time, officers who underperformed could be shunted into other positions or, in the worst case, demoted to the last position in which they were effective.
>
> The consequent increased churn among the middle and upper ranks, coupled with an improved ability to more objectively assess performance in the field---or, rather, in the training exercises of this peacetime military---seemed to justify a more orderly approach to the issuance of promotions and positions. The officer corps was divided into three broad tracks: Firstly, *Field Command*, for officers who display unusual skill at commanding troops in the field, coupled with strong leadership qualities. Secondly, *Strategic Command*, for officers who display strong strategic acumen, despite what may be a lack of tactical or leadership ability. Finally, the Specialist* track, for officers with unusual ability at the more technical aspects of military operations, such as logistics, fortification, and so forth. To address internal concerns, strong efforts were made to avoid locking personnel into tracks, by monitoring personnel for hidden potential or improvements in other skills with experience.
>
> Despite continually refined usage of metrics and AI modelers, efficient allocation of personnel is still not a completely solved problem, as testified to in the current war: there is a steady stream of examples of specialist officers rising to the challenge of field command in emergency situations.
>
> For MG officers, the three‐track system is slightly modified; Field Command is more accurately termed *Field Command and Combat,* and serves as a repository for magical girls unusually suited to combat in the field, for example as part of the shock troop reserves of Magical Divisions.

\"This is nervewracking,\" Fleet Admiral Karishma Anand complained, pulling at her uniform nervously. \"It\'s one thing to command an operation where you can see what\'s going on and have control. It\'s another to just sit here and wait, when all you can get is sketchy memory relays from clairvoyants.\"

\"I know,\" General de Chatillon said. \"But we should be glad we have anything at all, from this distance. We can\'t risk standard transmission on an operation as sensitive as this.\"

De Chatillon made a pyramid with his hands and shifted in his chair---black, explosive‐resistant, synthesized leather---nervously.

\"Well, if we couldn\'t see anything, then we couldn\'t hold this little soiree,\" Field Marshal Sualem said sourly, glancing back and forth between the other two. \"Though honestly that might have been for the best. I\'ll admit, sitting around here biting my nails is getting to me too. Even trying to split my consciousness, I find that my attention keeps getting pulled back to this.\"

\"Quiet, all of you,\" Field Marshal Tsvangirai said, waving his hand dismissively. \"I\'m trying to watch.\"

Field Marshal Tomoe Mami watched the exchange in silence, leaning on the virtual table with both elbows, hands clasped under her chin. She watched how de Chatillon kept his eye on the Fleet Admiral, the kind of subtle gesture that, under more mundane circumstances, would have tempted her to speculate about the unmarried General. She watched how Sualem wrung his hands nervously, apparently without realizing it, in full sight of everyone in the room, and watched Fleet Admiral Xing fiddle with one of those old‐fashioned input tablets he favored.

They were meeting in the familiar General Staff meeting room, of course, except that this time Mami was viewing it through remote virtuality, as real as the people seated around her might seem. Some members of the General Staff favored their own personal virtualities, with fancy glowing tables or a starry background or what have you, but Mami preferred to keep it simple, residing in a simple replication of the cozy *Carthago* meeting room, with its giant mahogany table, matching wooden paneling, and framed portraits of Unification Wars commanders. Among other things, she had grown used to the feeling of the table under her elbows and the warm lighting of the miniature chandelier above them.

It didn\'t quite feel so cozy today, though.

On her left, Field Marshal Erwynmark\'s expression matched Mami\'s in silence and severity, so that she couldn\'t tell if he were devoting mindspace to the other members of the Staff, like her, or thinking about something else entirely. Like all of them, though, he was watching the fuzzy holographic video floating over the table, occupying the central display space.

There had been, in truth, nothing much to see so far in this operation; there was only the tense monotony of a MagOps team crammed into a tiny insertion ship, pilot and stealth generator taut with focus, the latter\'s gem fed a slow trickle of grief cubes as she worked to keep the ship invisible. One of the remaining operatives told a joke to lessen the tension, and the others laughed half‐heartedly---and soundlessly. Sound was irretrievable at such long‐range.

In truth, there was no reason the General Staff needed to turn out for a special meeting to watch this mission. Many had no operational connection to the situation. Even Sector Special Commander Mami didn\'t really need to. What did it matter, when she could issue no orders, when there was nothing she could do to affect anything? The fate of the Black Heart team had been sealed the moment they set out for the moon with the Wormhole Stabilizer; it was just that no one yet knew what that fate was.

It just seemed right that they should watch, when the fate of Humanity might well hang in the balance.

A part of Mami wondered where Clarisse van Rossum was at this moment, and what she was doing.

Across from Mami sat Fleet Admiral Feodorovich, the perpetually busy Admiral who constantly missed Staff meetings, too busy holding the shoulders of the salient with her fleets, preparing a possible incipient offensive. The raven‐haired, steely‐eyed woman hadn\'t missed this meeting, though, not when the events unfolding before them would affect everything she did from here out.

To Mami\'s right sat a special guest, not a member of the Staff, but invited here anyway. General Kuroi was Commander of the Black Heart, and those were her girls out there. Her youthful appearance and short height stood out at the table, even with Mami there.

\"They\'ve reached low orbit,\" Fleet Admiral Xing commented, for those among them who might not be familiar with small ship operations. "They\'re preparing for insertion.\"

Xing apparently liked commenting, since it was often quite clear that everyone could get the relevant information from their implants and didn\'t need him to say it explicitly.

This time, though, what little chatter there was in the room quieted down, as they watched the operatives put on breathing helmets, holster whatever conventional weapons they thought necessary to bring, strap on their equipment packs---complete with personal stealth generators, grief cubes, and anti‐grav to lighten the load. One of the girls, Mami knew, was exceptionally rare: a pocket dimension generator, capable of storing and conjuring equipment from her hands. She would be carrying the heavy weaponry, and the PAYNE nuclear device.

With a staccato of light flashes, muted by the clairvoyance, they transformed, their armor following the transformation---customized and enchanted by MSY specialists to bear the process, rather than just vanish as clothing did. The moon didn\'t have a standard oxygen atmosphere, and there was no sense taking the risk that the aliens would vent the atmosphere of the facility once the alarms went up, as they had in the past. Sure, the operatives could push on, but operating on no oxygen cost a lot of magic.

They could have put on spacesuits after the fact, as the Magi Cæli did, but here every bit of added efficiency mattered, and customized armor fit into the scheme, even if permanently enchanted objects were still surprisingly difficult to make.

Irrationally, Mami couldn\'t help but think of certain children\'s shows she had seen in her childhood, but she pushed the thought away. Not right now.

The girls gathered in a cluster in the middle of the ship, a few of them pressing hands together in prayer, probably to the Goddess, though there was a slight chance one of them was from a more traditional religion. Mami could have looked it up, but what did it matter?

This was it.

Atmospheric insertion was one of the riskiest portions of the mission. Alien sensors were exceptionally good, and they had no magical stealth generators capable of concealing an entire ship moving inside the moon\'s relatively thick atmosphere---it was too difficult to hide the reentry shockwave, even on the gentlest possible anti‐grav assisted descent.

They had considered the options in the planning meeting beforehand.

There were stealth generators capable of causing incorporeality, but those rare girls also couldn\'t conceal the whole ship, nor could any of them maintain it for longer than ten seconds or so, which didn\'t even bring up the magic compatibility issues they had with each other, and with teleporters. Plus, even assuming they managed to land the ship somehow, they also had to somehow launch the ship back up at the completion of the mission, after the aliens had realized they were there. It would have been suicide.

Instead they were doing something that was hopefully much simpler. A teleportation relay. The safe distance to the surface of the moon, just under one hundred eighty kilometers, was too long for their teleporters to make the jump in one go, but multiple teleporters---in this case, four---could span the distance to the interior of the facility, with the tiny intervening periods covered by a stealth generator, who could now handle the much smaller mass. They would go to work, hopefully be fully recharged by the time they were done, and perform the same relay back up to the ship at the end. If one of the teleporters died, the ship was to try to go lower. If more than one died, then the instructions for those on the ground were to die bravely.

The girls in the hologram in front of them nodded to each other, colorful helmets bobbing up and---and the scene shifted, to a view looking downward at the same cluster of girls, dozens of kilometers further down, in sudden freefall. Several of the girls raised hands, pushing the group horizontally to slow them all down. They had to cancel their remaining orbital velocity before they reached the ground, which necessitated these gaps between teleports. There was a main telekinetic, but self‐propulsion was one of those powers that almost every veteran had, either naturally or self‐taught, so there was no reason they couldn\'t help. The whole affair was almost a Rube Goldberg machine, but it was the only way.

It was interesting to realize that though they could see the girls with the aid of the clairvoyant and the assent of the stealth generator, they were indeed stealthed.

Twenty seconds later, and the scene shifted again. Now they saw nothing but ground. Of course, the girls themselves could look around and see the spherical horizon, but Mami and the others were looking straight down.

Another twenty seconds, and some of the girls lowered their hands. Mami knew that there was still velocity to cancel; it was planned meticulously, and one of the goals of the training runs had been to waste as little time as possible exposed in the air before teleporting into the facility proper, behind their forcefields. Still, they were almost there. Just once more---

The hologram washed out in a sea of blinding white, so that even with their ocular implants and the intervening layer of virtuality, the General Staff recoiled instinctively. Then the hologram vanished.

\"What the hell was that?\" Tsvangirai demanded.

A new image appeared in the hologram before, this time a readout and remote scan of the moon. Most of them leaned forward to look. A few stayed put, already reading the message internally.

*Long‐range sensors indicate detonation on the surface of the moon, Machina thought, unnecessarily. *Probable antimatter explosive. Estimated yield: 10 megatons.*

There were a few seconds of stunned silence around the table.

\"Well, fuck,\" Sualem said, finally, breaking the ice.

\"They detonated an antimatter explosive?\" Feodorovich asked, face stony.

\"With our stealth, it was probably the most reliable way of ensuring elimination,\" Xing said, eyes downcast. \"If they turned their base forcefields on, they could withstand it, if they detonated the device high enough. I doubt any of our operatives could have. Even if they did, they\'re irretrievable now.\"

\"How the hell did they know?\" Anand demanded incredulously. \"How?\"

\"Stealth generation doesn\'t work perfectly with teleportation skills,\" Erwynmark said. \"At each teleport, the people being transported switch places with air at the destination. In this case, there\'s a pressure effect. The air lower down is higher pressure. So there\'s an outrushing of air at the point of departure that the stealth generator can\'t cover. It showed up in our simulations, but we didn\'t think they could detect it in just sixty seconds. Or, it could be something else.\"

The table reverted to a deathly silence.

\"I should leave,\" Tsvangirai said, finally. \"My men will need me.\"

\"We should meet,\" Mami said, gesturing at him, swallowing whatever she was feeling. \"There will be a lot to do. No doubt, the aliens are already moving to cover the moon with heavier defenses. There is no more need for us to pretend.\"

\"Yes,\" Erwynmark agreed stonily. \"We have already discussed the failure contingency. We should implement it as soon as possible. Dismissed.\"

Mami disconnected.

She wasn\'t in her own cabin, as would have been possible. Instead, she was in a meeting room on her flagship, with Tsvangirai, some of the other Staff members in the area, and a special guest.

She put her hand on the shoulder of the girl next to her, Kuroi Kana, who had also disconnected.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Are you alright?\" Shen Xiao Long asked, as Mami headed into her room to take a brief nap, an exhausting fifteen hours later.

At that moment, Mami still held in the back of her mind the image of a certain magical girl, a stealth generator, preparing for a critical mission, a little over a day ago.

\"I won\'t disappoint you,\" the girl had said, smiling at her loving Matriarch.

Mami didn\'t think disappointment was Kana\'s problem right now.

\"I\'m fine,\" she said, before letting the door close behind her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"You couldn\'t save me.\"

Mami looked around in a panic, desperately trying to localize the source of the voice, which seemed to come from everywhere at once. Somehow, the complete blackness of her environment, the complete lack of any indication of where she was or what was going on, failed to even register. Not while the voice was there. The maddening---

\"You miserable failure.\"

This time, the voice gained a certain substance. It sounded young, female, and the identity of its source danced just beyond Mami\'s ability to grasp. It was a voice that should have been sweet, should have been sitting at her table happily eating cake and drinking tea, rather than hurling accusations.

Mami shook her head in confusion. Cake? Tea? Why was that imagery suddenly coming to mind?

\"What a miserable senpai you are,\" the girl said. \"You don\'t even remember who I am, do you? But I guess that\'s not surprising, given how many others you\'ve forgotten.\"

\"Who are you?\" Mami demanded, unable to get over the intense pain of not knowing.

\"When\'s the last time you even thought about me?\" a new voice demanded.

This voice had a tone and nuances different from the previous voice, but its powerful emotional impact was unchanged.

Mami spun on her heel, realizing for the first time that she had a heel to spin on, and saw her first hint of color in this black world.

\"Why didn\'t you stop me?\" the short‐haired girl demanded of her, cape fluttering.

The girl stabbed her sword outward, stopping just short of Mami\'s neck, so that she flinched backward.

\"You knew something was wrong,\" the girl said, sword pointed accusingly. \"Kyouko begged you to do something, but you didn\'t act. You felt it even before she told you, and you didn\'t act. Instead I died.\"

\"I\'m sorry, Miki‐san!\" Mami pleaded. \"It was a mistake, I know. But we didn\'t know what was going on!\"

\"Humph,\" Sayaka said, pulling back her sword and turning away. \"It\'s always Miki‐san, Miki‐san. You can\'t bear to call anyone by their personal name, can you? You might get close to yet another girl you can\'t save.\"

\"That\'s... that\'s unfair!\" Mami protested.

\"What terrible excuses you\'ve made for yourself,\" the girl said, voice now dripping with disdain and mockery. \"\'We didn\'t know\', as if that excuses anything. And Kyouko knew. You knew she knew, but you never asked. You still haven\'t asked. You don\'t want to face it, so you tell yourself she doesn\'t know either, but you know the real truth. How many lies do you tell yourself, just so you can sleep at night?\"

\"I didn\'t want to break it,\" Mami said. \"I finally had friends and, and---\"

She stopped, unable to finish, and just stared at the other girl, eyes wide, breathing heavily. She stared until the other girl shook her head in pity and walked away, slowly fading into the darkness.

\"You said I could do it, senpai,\" a new voice said, \"but you failed me.\"

Mami turned to look at the new girl, whose sable costume was barely visible in the darkness.

\"I was one the MSY\'s brightest stars,\" the girl said. \"One of its most powerful. You recruited me to your \'Soul Guard\'. You told me I would be great. You said I should be the one to watch alone from the roof, even when I was worried about being alone. You said I could handle it.\"

The girl dropped her face, seeming to cry softly.

\"You should have known it was a trap,\" she said, tears streaming down her face. \"Why did it take you so long to come save me? All you saved was a corpse.\"

Mami\'s eyes watered in sympathy, her mind replaying the ancient memory, of her favorite prodigy, the young one with the silly laugh who could cook together with her, falling out of the sky. She remembered how empty her eyes had looked, her soul gem crushed and shattered within the fist of Eirin the Elusive.

\"I\'m--I\'m sorry,\" Mami managed, through the tears. \"I wasn\'t experienced enough. I wanted you to experience fighting on your own. I\'ve regretted it my whole life.\"

The girl shook her head.

\"Your regret didn\'t save me. You should never have let me go alone.\"

Mami looked down, unable to respond, as this girl faded away too, this time without even walking away.

The next voice sounded familiar indeed.

\"You let me leave,\" Homura accused, appearing in front of her.

\"I tried to stop you,\" Mami said. \"But you wouldn\'t let me. And then you hid from us. If you had just come back---\"

\"You knew there was something wrong with me for four centuries, Mami,\" she said. \"You just left it alone. Why? Were you that afraid of losing my friendship? What kind of coward are you?\"

\"I--I tried, Homura,\" Mami insisted. \"But you wouldn\'t listen. You sent Atsuko‐san home crying. I couldn\'t fight you.\"

\"You knew I was a time bomb,\" Homura said. \"You should have tried harder.\"

\"How could I?\" Mami demanded. \"How could I risk losing you?\"

\"You could have held on no matter what. Why did it matter to you what I thought of you?\"

The girl harrumphed, shook her head disdainfully, flipped her long hair, and walked away into the darkness.

\"I just wanted to be left alone,\" a new voice said. \"My only crime was to refuse to bow down to your precious MSY. You hunted me down and killed me.\"

\"You wouldn\'t let us capture you,\" Mami said weakly, avoiding the girl\'s eyes. \"I had no choice. I had to take the kill shot. It was in the instructions.\"

\"Did you really have to?\" the girl asked. \"You could have just let me go.\"

\"It had to be done,\" Mami insisted, \"We offered you every possible incentive, and you wouldn\'t concede. You were interfering with our grief cube harvesting. We couldn\'t just let that go.\"

\"How else was I supposed to survive? You knew I needed the cubes.\"

There was an accusing silence, before the girl continued:

\"If what you did was so noble, then why didn\'t you ever do it again? The first time, you wanted to do it personally. After that, you stayed away. Eventually, you quit. Why?\"

Mami bit her lip.

\"Murderer,\" the girl breathed, eyes sharp, before disappearing abruptly enough that Mami jumped.

\"She wasn\'t even your biggest victim,\" the first, original voice accused, again without source. \"Eventually, your MSY grew even larger, and then it found that there were other organizations that had copied it. You could have lived together in peace, but you destroyed them, tore them apart and picked up the pieces.\"

\"That\'s not true!\" Mami insisted, looking up, wishing she had someone to point at.

\"That\'s not true,\" she repeated, quietly. \"We negotiated whenever we could. Most mergers were completely peaceful.\"

\"But not all of them, miss diplomat. You know that. And how many others were \'persuaded\' by your Black Heart? How many people did your precious Yuma‐chan have to kill? You don\'t even know, do you? You don\'t want to ask.\"

\"I did everything I could,\" Mami said. \"It just wasn\'t possible to convince everybody. I wasn\'t personally involved---\"

\"Why was it so important?\" the voice, so terribly familiar, demanded. "Why? Why did your MSY have to rule the world? Why did you want that kind of power?\"

\"The world needed us!\" Mami argued. \"The world was falling apart. We had to be unified, so that we could do what was necessary---\"

\"Some saving you did! Your MSY got power, and then sat on its hands while the world burned. What did it matter to you?\"

\"I tried!\" Mami said. \"We tried so hard to get things moving, but we just couldn\'t convince the voters. We---\"

\"While you dithered, trying to win consensus, tens of millions died, and billions suffered,\" the voice continued, ignoring her. \"If you had acted earlier, the war might not have been so terrible. Every year you wasted was literally millions of lives. You should have been harsher.\"

\"We couldn\'t do any better!\" Mami insisted.

But even as she insisted, her mind wandered back to the many, many times she had flipped through the casualty reports, taking in the numbers, the faces of the dead, until she had learned to stop, for her own health.

\"You keep saying that!\" the voiced pointed out, gaining power and volume and harshness. \"You didn\'t know, you didn\'t have enough experience, you didn\'t have enough power! Why all the excuses? Why couldn\'t you just do it? Why did you let the decisions of others take precedence? Today you ordered another batch of girls to their deaths. How many more men and women are going to die because you won\'t do things correctly? Does Erwynmark know who he\'s trusting?\"

\"I---you can\'t---\" Mami spluttered, frustrated.

\"And the worst part is: you\'ve forgotten all of it! That\'s how you deal with it, isn\'t it? You just don\'t think about it, you avoid thinking about it, or you tell yourself lies. You never face anything. Your friends have died, because you\'re too scared to risk facing the truth! You\'ve even forgotten---\"

Mami\'s eyes snapped open.

She was briefly lost, eyes flittering back and forth, more confused than she was usually when waking from a dream.

*You\'re needed on the bridge,* Machina thought simply, as the contours of her Admiral\'s suite finally resolved around her.

*Did you wake me?* Mami thought.

*Yes,* Machina thought, in the exact worried tone that Mami herself often used. *Honestly, that was a bit of a concerning dream. Are you alright?*

Mami sat up, taking a deep breath, gritting her teeth slightly.

*I\'m fine,* she thought. *Nothing I haven\'t been dealing with since forever.*

*If you say so,* Machina thought. *You should use a grief cube.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*The squid are hitting our supply routes hard,*\" Ryouko had relayed to her warrant officer. \"*Division plans to concentrate and drive them back. Leave it! Let the others finish the job. Get everyone accounted for.*\"

Ryouko always felt disappointed when forced to leave a job half‐done, but it was frustratingly routine. A high‐priority target would be scouted, she\'d be called in to cripple the defenses, more standard units would follow in their wake---and then they\'d be told to leave, to go somewhere else and attack something else, or help to stabilize the line somewhere, or just go back in reserve somewhere.

It was efficient allocation of resources. Using powerful MG‐enhanced units for standard frontline duty was to be avoided if possible, to maintain flexibility and minimize risk. Usually it wasn\'t possible in the kinds of situations their MG‐concentrated Magical Division got committed to, since they were often kept in reserve precisely for more difficult situations, but they made the attempt. That meant that once command calculated that local victory was assured, they would get instantly removed.

She understood that, but it was annoying to leave without the satisfaction of actually blowing something up.

It also meant that when a scouting party had sent back word about a hidden alien Processing Center in this sector of the line, she had been surprised to see that she and her platoon had been committed without the support of any of her fellow MGs. That implied that something was up, somewhere.

The platoon hadn\'t managed to reform in its entirety, though. A certain Corporal Singh failed to reestablish contact---attempts to reach her by comms had been fruitless given the heavy alien jamming, and attempts to scout the infantryman\'s last known position had run into unexpected resistance. Apparently, she had gotten cut off somehow in the midst of the jammed chaos.

Traditionally, there were two options. Ryouko could order a probing attack to try and recover the infantryman. Alternatively, and more cost‐effectively, she could wait and hope for the best. Generally speaking, it was out of the question that she would venture out personally to retrieve what was only one missing infantryman, and frankly it was almost certainly a loss.

She had gritted her teeth slightly, thought about the training that told her not to go, and decided that, as a teleporter, she could mitigate the risk.

\"*Standby and continue the concentration without me,*\" she had relayed. \"*Sanchez, Hu, Zhang, with me.*\"

Strictly speaking, the speech, even of the non‐verbal form, was unnecessary. They could follow her commands via their internal displays and mental readouts perfectly fine. Humans, though, were talkers.

It wasn\'t really possible to read her warrant officer\'s face, not when that face was hidden inside a visorless armored helmet three times the size of her head. She didn\'t need to, though, to imagine the Egyptian frowning in disapproval---though something about the mental image bothered her.

\"*Respectfully,*\" the man had relayed, armored fingers shifting on his enormous weapon, \"*is that really necessary? It would be a risk---*\"

\"*I\'ll be careful, Omer,*\" she had thought. \"*We have stealth generators for a reason.*\"

\"*You always do this,*\" he had thought. \"*It\'s not a good idea.*\"

Ryouko had ignored him.

That was how she now found herself in yet another stretch of this interminable jungle, invisible behind her stealth, flanked by flying cloaked point defense drones---PDDs. She had teleported in, bringing with her the three armored infantry---all from squad B, to make sure they had good cohesion---who advanced cautiously, drones at their feet working to clear a path through the foliage and vines. They walked in silence in their sound‐suppressive boots, green armor doing its best to obscure itself in the foliage, which was relatively easy, given that the density of plants above them turned the area into a sort of twilight, despite the bright, hot star in the sky. She wore the boots too, though of course they had been transformed to match her costume. They were particularly important when every step you took was full of branches, acid‐filled insects, singing---yes, *singing*---grass, or whatever other dead giveaways this endlessly inventive ecosystem chose to produce.

The planet Giungla was not, she thought, creatively named, given that the word just meant \"jungle\" in Italian. The name certainly got the point across, though. The planet was practically swimming in nitrates, and had somehow developed a biosphere in absurdly close proximity to its parent star. Coupled with an enormous abundance of atmospheric water that would have been a surface‐covering ocean anywhere else, its plant life had access to tremendous amounts of energy and, with the low gravity, could grow enormous. That, in turn, motivated herbivores of every size and description, from tiny insects to land animals larger than anything the earth had ever seen. With the resources available, both sides could afford to get creative.

Of course, it made most of the planet quite pernicious for heavy weaponry. Which still didn\'t make it pleasant for the infantry.

Even with the canopy above them, the heat and humidity would have been crushing for a non‐enhanced human. Thank the Goddess for implants.

That was another thing---apparently, the Cult\'s internal swearing mechanisms had spread throughout the military, spoken fervently by true believers, and sardonically by everyone else, though at this point it mostly wasn\'t ironic anymore. The training courses encouraged budding mage officers to internalize the vernacular and use it, for bonding reasons with the troops. Ryouko couldn\'t help but think that was self‐perpetuating.

*Ah, training courses,* she thought. Come to think of it, that felt like almost yesterday.

Again, she felt a slight sense of... *déjà vu*?

*This damn planet must have low‐level neurotoxins or something,* she thought.

The intelligence had been good, fortunately. This patch of jungle was empty. The resistance the scouts had encountered had merely been unfortunately placed, an alien unit probing into the accidental gap between Corporal Singh and the rest of the platoon.

\"*The hell is she doing, anyway?*\" Corporal Hu thought. \"*When communications are jammed, you maintain either visual or short‐range contact if at all possible. It\'s in the damn field manual.*\"

They were all at least \"Corporal\". MG platoons were staffed with experienced veterans, not green privates. It showed how much the core of the platoon was valued.

\"*Don\'t judge,*\" Sergeant Sanchez thought. \"*It\'s not always possible. You know that. She was caught being too aggressive when her squad came under heavy fire. It\'s in the damn unit history. Aren\'t we encouraged to be aggressive? She\'s probably pinned down.*\"

She was eyeing Sanchez for promotion to a platoon‐level position.

He was correct, of course. Keeping within short‐range contact was unusual for infantrymen in most situations. Despite the vast numbers of infantry being poured into the armed forces, the majority of contested worlds contained a very low density of troops, by historical Earth standards. Urban battles tended to be denser, obviously, but out in the hinterlands, it wasn\'t rare to find a single infantryman or group of infantrymen alone in a full square kilometer. Of course, the clouds of drones balanced it out somewhat.

\"*Do we even know if she\'s still alive?*\" Zhang thought.

\"*No,*\" Ryouko thought. \"*That\'s what we\'re here to find out. If one of you were out there, you\'d want me to do this.*\"

There was silence for a moment, as they continued to follow their search path.

\"*Well, sir,*\" Sanchez thought, finally. \"*As a point of fact, we might not want you to do this. After all---*\"

\"*Yes, yes, I know,*\" Ryouko thought, a bit testily. \"*Might not be worth the risk. But this situation is more than low risk enough. I\'m not leaving her out here.*\"

That ended the conversation, as they worked their way around one of the enormous \"megatrees\" that dotted the relatively low‐gravity planet, each peering into the foliage and low‐lying mist with enhanced vision, relying heavily on their infrared. Ryouko, especially, with her doubly‐enhanced vision, made the effort to look.

The three squad members were each about two and a half meters tall and a meter wide in their ultra‐dense, self‐healing armor. The suits didn\'t have a transparent faceplate---too much structural weakness, better to go with embedded optical fiber. Ryouko always felt kind of silly standing next to one in her dress.

She frowned. That thought about the dress had a weird flavor to it, though she couldn\'t put her finger on it.

She had been feeling strange all day.

In any case, the assault rifles the infantry carried were behemoths, the outsized cousins of the weapons she had once practiced with. It wasn\'t that a magical girl couldn\'t handle the weight---it was that their hands literally couldn\'t reach around to toggle the trigger. Plus, they were bulky, though there did exist \"small‐hand\" models that some girls favored. Personally, Ryouko was dubious about wielding a weapon that was taller than she was, but she supposed it probably made you feel powerful.

There were uses to having a gun, though, including the SW‒155 she had holstered. For instance, guns now came with camera scopes and varying amounts of sophisticated sensors, so that one could \"see\" something just by pointing the gun at it. This was useful for, for example, firing out of cover without sticking your head out.

Of course, the assault rifle wasn\'t even the main component of a standard infantryman\'s firepower. For a true accounting, it wasn\'t even sufficient to count the sniper rifles and assorted light and heavy weaponry that came with each platoon, or the high‐power low‐use lasers that came with all projectile weaponry, or the numerous weapons that came with the suit itself---melee blades, shock devices, and cutting lasers in both arms, a grenade launcher in the right arm, three miniature missiles in the other, and so on and so forth, all capable of being cannibalized for armor repairs if necessary.

The primary contributor to overall unit firepower was the countless drones that accompanied it. Limited by their varying degrees of size‐dependent intelligence, alien and Human drones often fought each other to partial stalemate---with a moderate alien advantage---so it was occasionally possible to forget they were there. Complete drone dominance by one side, however, led rapidly to fatalities on the other side.

Ryouko never forgot, though, if only because she was obliged to teleport a swarm of drones practically any time she went anywhere. Fortunately, there was no such thing as \"personal\" drones, so personnel could often be shuttled between locations on their own. That still left moving personnel to empty locations, moving drones around to prevent the line from becoming unbalanced, carrying drones with her for safety reasons when she wanted to conduct a deep penetration...

The small ones, especially, seemed to see no problem with getting in her hair when ordered to \"make contact\".

Ryouko felt suddenly uncomfortable. Not because of thinking about the drones---she wouldn\'t get uncomfortable just from that---but because... well, she couldn\'t tell.

\"*Do you smell that?*\" Sanchez asked. \"*Smells like fighting, somewhere nearby.*\"

They stopped, taking deep nasal breaths to force air past their modified nasal passages---the suits deliberately allowed a filtered set of molecules into the internal air stream, for precisely this reason, though of course it could be turned off, adjusted, and so forth.

He was right; that was indeed exactly what it smelled like. If Ryouko had been unsure, she could have consulted Clarisse about what the smell probably meant.

Without any \"verbal\" prompting, they changed direction, attempting to track the source of the scent. A quiet tension settled over the group; they were headed into a probable battle zone. They would know soon whether Corporal Singh had survived, or whether the fighting was merely her drones making a programmed effort to return to the line.

Sure enough, it was only a few short minutes before a mental ping alerted Ryouko---and the others---to the fact that one of their more intelligent drones---a missile‐bearing flier---had come into contact with one of hers. A quick relayed query indicated that, while communications were still sparse, dependent on occasional drone relay, the soldier in question was alive so far as the drone knew. In addition, friendly drone numbers in the vicinity were way down, and reinforcements, particularly air support, would be appreciated.

Hu chuckled.

\"*Not much chance of air support here,*\" he thought.

They knew, though apparently Singh didn\'t, that the local heavy air support---the gun platforms, the AI heavy fighters and bombers, and the Aer Magi---were currently being held mostly in reserve, with the rest embroiled in a massive air superiority contest over their own local supply centers. They wouldn\'t be helping anytime soon.

The most important piece of information to come out of the exchange, though, was a set of relatively up‐to‐date location markers, indicating the infantryman\'s last reported position, and the positions of known alien forces and firezones.

Without needing prompting, Clarisse placed her into \"field command\" mode, a combination of the time‐slowing combat trance used by infantrymen in active combat and the more immersive command mode used by generals and the like. Neither the field command nor the combat trance was used by magical girls during active combat, because of interference effects---and because their instinctive hyper‐fast combat responses were more effective anyway---but the field command mode was useful out of combat.

She studied the situation for what was to her a long while. Singh was indeed pinned down, unable to shift out of cover without drawing withering fire. Her drones were experiencing heavy attrition and would soon be unable to provide meaningful cover.

Ryouko had brought a large group of drones with her, but because of her mass limitations, it was nowhere near the full complement that usually accompanied even one infantryman. Consequently, they would provide only a small degree of assistance.

In terms of local awareness, the positions of some stationary alien laser turrets were well‐localized, but the positions of mobile elements, including any actual personnel, were only vaguely known.

She took a breath, pondering whether or not to risk breaching her element of surprise. It would likely have been possible to just perform another teleport, retrieve Singh, and get out, but she wanted to do a little damage. Bloodthirst, if you wanted to call it that.

It was probably worth the risk.

She held out her hand, and the pack on her back extended its robotic arm, disgorging the equipment she requested---five tiny surveillance drones.

She enchanted them, just a little, attaching them to a set of five homing arrows, designed to dissolve and disappear before reaching their targets, to lower the risk of being noticed as anything unusual. It was a trick she had only recently acquired, along with the homing arrows themselves. Said arrows took a lot of time to prep---but she wasn\'t in active combat, after all.

Then, as the other three stayed on guard, she elevated her crossbow arm and fired in the vague direction of where most of the interposing forces were.

It would have been a bit much to review five fast‐paced video feeds at once on her own, but her TacComp easily picked up any slack there might have been.

Two alien stationary laser batteries, as expected. Two infantry troopers, easily more than a match for any Human infantryman. Three of those pernicious \"Hydra\" flying missile launchers on patrol, looking for an opening in Singh\'s defenses to fire. And... one of her arrows seemed headed for empty space, high up in the branches of one of the trees.

*A sniper, probably,* her TacComp thought. *Or something else cloaked.*

*Yes,* she agreed. *Best to take whatever it is out first.*

She relayed an order to Singh to stay put. The order might take a while to reach her, but she doubted the infantryman would try and move. Without wasting time saying it, she ordered the three infantrymen to provide a distraction by taking out the Hydras, which were close by, but not to give the probable sniper a clear shot at them until it---aliens were *it*---was taken out.

A map laid out in her vision, showing the locations of the laser gun, the infantry, and the possible sniper. It showed blue dots for where she might want to teleport, and indicated what she might want to do when she got there. This attack plan also imprinted itself directly into her mind, of course.

She held out her hand again, and this time received some smart grenades. They were small---she could fit four in her hand---but potent. There was no pin to pull; instead they primed on mental command, and detonated a specified time after leaving an infantryman\'s hand. They could also be detonated on command, but the reliability of that depended on alien interference, which made it often useless.

Given the alien propensity for shielding, they were designed to blast out a wave of secondary explosive pellets that detonated on contact, reshaping themselves to take advantage of the Munroe effect for armor penetration. In the last stages of detonation, a series of monoatomically‐edged shrapnel pieces were hurtled through what was hopefully a breach in the armor, carrying aggressive nanites intended to wreak havoc on a soft interior. Besides being generally effective against armored targets---which was practically everything above a certain mass---they were also good against alien forcefields which, in many ways, behaved like armor. In that case, there was a reasonable chance of temporary forcefield failure, though the shrapnel nanites usually failed to do more than superficial damage to the armor below the forcefield. At very close range, there was an excellent chance of forcefield failure.

An intricately crafted weapon that was, sad to say, reverse engineered from the aliens.

It was important, because the forcefields somehow blocked her ability to teleport things---or parts of things---via the ground. It also didn\'t use any of her magic, always a plus.

She took a breath as her PDDs clung to unobtrusive parts of her body.

When she exhaled, she was in the air above the part of the tree where the \"sniper\" was. In that same moment, she released the arrow.

With an explosive display of green sparks, the sniper\'s shields failed, and the arrow tore straight through one of the limbs of the sniper, the now disconnected terminal end beginning to fall. Ryouko\'s second arrow was already ready, and this one was a headshot.

Aliens could penetrate Human non‐magical stealth, but it required some of their better sensors, and only their best sensors could give, for example, an indication of where the soul gem was. That was important.

She teleported out a few hundred milliseconds before drone light laser fire tore through where she had been, and this time she appeared right next to one of the laser batteries, its turrets gleaming and menacing even in the limited light. She teleported right back out, leaving a single smart grenade behind.

She repeated the feat above the next battery, the two alien infantry in their multi‐limbed suits pouring firepower blindly into the sky. At each stop, she dropped another grenade into the mist and plant cover below her, taking a moment to peer into infrared to make sure she didn\'t bomb the wrong side of a hedge or hit some sort of tree or electric vine, while the PDDs she carried with her deflected away projectiles that happened to be heading in her direction.

Then, spotting the detonations in IR, she picked a useful intermediate patch of ground to teleport onto, not even bothering to touch the ground with her hands. She teleported ten meters into the air, carrying with her a thin shaving of the ground and only part of the two alien infantry members and the laser cannons. She didn\'t feel anything block part of her teleportation, so she knew she had got them all.

She would have liked to stay to see for herself, but it was safer to keep moving.

Her last jump placed her next to Singh. Since all the jumps had been short‐range, she had been able to execute quickly; it had been thirteen seconds, by her internal chronometer. Of course, there was also her limit on the number of jumps she could do in a short period, but she wasn\'t close to that yet. She was, however, approaching the limit of her stealth generator. Fortunately, she was essentially done.

Corporal Singh looked up at her in surprise and fear from where she was prone, pointing her weapon at Ryouko. It would have been a hazard were it not for TacComps, which generally prevented accidental discharges. The woman was in cover behind what they called a \"hedge\", which was really a tangled mess of surprisingly resilient, poisonous vines that the local macrofoliage used to dissuade herbivores. On close inspection, it was shockingly intricate, and substantially attenuated even the heaviest automatic fire. It would have been more memorable if she hadn\'t seen hundreds of variations on the theme in the last half‐hour. Giant trees with appendages that lashed at you if you got too close. Dense undergrowth that hid pools of acid. Vines with an electric charge. And so on and so forth.

She touched the woman\'s armor, and they returned to the others.

\"*Nicely done,*\" she thought, when she found that the Hydras had been neutralized successfully and quickly.

They gathered around her, making contact, while she charged a longer‐range teleport. As many drones as could make it returned to her, but many were too far, or were necessary to provide some measure of cover. It was an acceptable loss.

Ryouko had time to reflect that her style of fighting was rather impersonal, which both relieved and slightly disappointed her.

She reappeared at the far end, simultaneously shimmering back into visibility as her stealth system disengaged. She felt strangely disoriented, in a way that wasn\'t typical for her.

They had arrived at yet another region of the plant‐infested jungle, and were greeted by the quiet rumble of distant orbital bombardment, and the slightly louder \"silenced\" rumble of a Suvorov heavy tank passing by them on their right, navigating carefully over a path that had already been carved through the underbrush by numerous other vehicles, crushing resurgent plant life under its treads.

It was just one of what appeared to be an endless stream of such vehicles appearing in her tactical awareness. Each such self‐aware tank was large enough to be easily quadruple the size of her old bedroom. The one she was looking at was topped by a large contingent of armored infantry, weapons drawn but otherwise at ease. In the background, drones flew their way among the trees, or skittered their way along the ground, mostly unobtrusive. The sky was only barely visible through the concealing canopy overhead.

\"Hey,\" Asami said, her head appearing next to a bulbous protrusion near the rear of the tank---the forcefield generator, if Ryouko remembered correctly.

Ryouko winced at a pinch of pain in her head.

\"Is everything alright?\" Singh asked. \"Were you injured in the fight? Maybe one of the nanodrones got you.\"

*Is everything alright, Clarisse?* Ryouko thought.

*Your readouts are nominal,* \"she\" responded.

\"I\'m fine,\" she said. \"All of you, go find your squad.\"

Ryouko jumped upward onto the armored vehicle to join Asami. Tanks and other vehicles, such as self‐aware artillery, were a popular location for infantry to relax on the move. In the safer rear areas, this practice was moderately encouraged, since the forcefields carried by heavier vehicles also served as partial protection against sudden attacks, though it was often wise to quickly move somewhere else, depending on the manner of attack.

\"You\'re having headaches too?\" Asami asked. \"So am I. I got a pinch of pain just now, actually. The implants are supposed to prevent it, but I think it\'s this atmosphere. All the nitrates. But if only I had time to study the plants here. They\'re fascinating!\"

Ryouko noted that the girl had her stealth projector on, but only projecting an energy‐cheap layer of green camouflage. Well, that had been obvious even before she got on the tank, unless Asami had grown a new layer of green skin. Ryouko checked her energy reserves, then followed suit. It looked it was going to be one of those operations.

\"What\'s going on, then?\" Ryouko asked, even though she was already starting to receive the answer, her tactical and strategic readouts updating rapidly in the presence of so many transmitters. \"I know we\'re concentrating, but I didn\'t know we\'d be bringing this much armor.\"

She craned her head to look back at the line of tanks and other armored vehicles.

\"We\'re concentrating even more heavily,\" Asami said. \"We\'re performing a mid‐tactical counterattack. It seems the squid are hitting hard at the Tupi supply routes. Harder than expected. It\'s going to take more metal to push them out than originally thought.\"

The Tupi Clearings referred to a geographical area that, for various reasons, had much less plant life, a crucial feature on a planet where a set of clearings was significant enough to get a name, like oases in a desert. Besides being a major military supply route, they were also part of a major connecting artery between two of the planet\'s three major "cities\"---which Ryouko honestly found to be little more than small towns. Besides the motley crew of research scientists determined to bend the native plant life to human will, these towns also played an outsized role in the agricultural productivity of the entire sector, exporting valuable phosphates and nitrates so cheaply that many of the sector\'s colonies found it uneconomical to perform chemical fixation.

\"You should talk to your platoon,\" Asami said, a moment later, looking at Ryouko.

\"Yeah,\" she said, agreeing.

She pushed herself off the vehicle, landing in the soft moss below with a slight whump, then jogged back in the direction of her platoon.

She found about a quarter of it congregated on top of a tank about four back in the line, camouflaged armor blending with their tank\'s own camouflage to look like some sort of bulbous moving plant‐thing. Given the nature of the planet, that possibility couldn\'t entirely be written off, especially if the aliens were relying on air or satellite surveillance trying to peer down through the jungle canopy. It seemed adequate enough.

\"Good to see you made it back, sir,\" her warrant officer greeted, as she squeezed her way onto the vehicle. \"We were concerned when you took so long.\"

The man had lifted his headpiece to say it.

\"Just decided to shoot a few things while I was there,\" Ryouko said. "I like to stretch my legs every once in a while. I\'m back now, aren\'t I? How are things? Everyone up to speed on the new attack plan?\"

The officer frowned, seeming about to say something. But then his expression cleared and he said:

\"Of course. We\'ll be ready when the time comes.\"

\"Good,\" she said, a little awkwardly.

Warrant officers were absolutely vital to magical girl commanded platoons, performing a significant amount of the leadership and direct command, particularly when the \"lieutenant\" was peeled away to form part of a shock spearhead, which was apparently in just about every major attack and counterattack. Warrant officers such as Omer were considered \"tactical specialists\", part of the Field Command track, though the difference between them and many standard officers was often blurred.

She nodded, then scrabbled further up the hull to talk to one of the squad commanders.

This part of leadership didn\'t come naturally to her. She just didn\'t interact naturally with her subcommanders or any of the soldiers. It was to some degree unavoidable---no one newly assigned was any good at it, given the differing backgrounds, ages, and unique command situation---but she still felt she wasn\'t doing as good a job as she could have.

The goal was to earn respect and protectiveness. Not just respect for skills---that tended to come automatically, given the obvious difference in battlefield performance---but respect for intelligence and orders.

Protectiveness was necessary because you were more valuable than they were, and tended to come by default. Not only was it part of the indoctrination, but it took minimal---or, actually, no---effort to accidentally remind everyone of their own granddaughters, somewhere far, far away. If one really wanted to, one could play up the cuteness factor and try to gain added mileage that way---Asami was already the darling of her platoon, though she hadn\'t been trying for it---but it wasn\'t actually necessary. Ryouko, too, made no effort to cultivate anything like that, but she had a sneaking suspicion her platoon thought her cute anyway. If only she were taller. And had gotten a different dress...

She shook her head at herself. She had no idea what was bothering her so much today, but every once in a while, she got the biting feeling she was forgetting something important.

In any case, respect was a different beast entirely, especially given the massive age disparity at play. Soldiers were perfectly willing to trust magical girl centenarians, but most of those held much higher officerships. Trusting a green teenager did not come automatically, and had to be earned by constantly being on the ball and giving good orders.

There were some platoons where the magical girl was, command‐wise, just a battleflag, with the platoon sergeant having taken over all real command duties. Besides being somewhat humiliating, it also terminated your chances of serious promotion---if all your best skills were in direct combat, and not in tactical or strategic command, why make you do what you weren\'t any good at? Most likely, you\'d get shifted into a pure‐combat shock group. It was not a recipe for a long lifespan.

That was what Ryouko thought, anyway.

With that in mind, she made the rounds of her unit as they approached their staging area, hidden and partially cloaked in a strangely treeless patch of ground underneath the canopy, trying to talk to everyone. She scrounged up all her social skills, with Clarisse advising her the entire way. It was disturbing when your TacComp was noticeably better at it than you were.

At one point their stream of armor rerouted around a known miasma, the magical girls gaining an extra frisson of nervousness, even though they knew the DV units would take care of it.

Finally, they reached the staging area, the infantry jumping off the armor and moving to their starting positions, in the meantime performing maintenance checks, ensuring propulsion units were up to speed, and so forth. Ryouko, for her part, stocked up on grief cubes, the drones and grenades she liked, and an assault rifle. On top of that, she added a supplemental backpack to the one she already carried, full of support drones, and called another set to accompany her.

She did one last check‐in with her platoon, at their almost‐frontline starting positions, then left to join her battalion spearhead nearby. The majority of the time, the platoons were kept mobile and not expected to operate in close coordination with each other, but the battalion organization was useful for more organized actions---such as a tactical assault. Some of the more veteran and higher‐ranked girls were organized into pure‐MG \"shock groups\", but joining one was a career commitment away from higher command, one not generally imposed on newer girls.

When all fifteen of them had gathered into reasonable proximity---defined as close enough to quickly group together and attack, but far enough so as not to be easily killed by a lucky bombardment---Lieutenant Colonel Elena Santiago addressed them briefly, by telepathy rather than standard messaging.

*Good afternoon, ladies,* she thought. *You\'re all experienced enough now that I don\'t need to go into too much elaborate detail. The clairvoyants have already mapped out the area we\'re attacking into. This salient is still on the move, so stiff sides, mushy interior, as you\'d expect. But because it\'s on the move, don\'t be surprised if your initial objectives aren\'t exactly where the map says they are.*

*Command is very worried about this alien attack, and wants it stomped out ASAP. This is a two‐division attack. Your initial objectives are given. As always, be ready to carry the momentum as far as possible. We attack in ten minutes. Assemble.*

In fact, every individual soldier involved in the attack, from lieutenant general down, knew everything she had just said, as part of the general doctrine of having a maximally informed and versatile soldiery, with only outsider units cut off from the information, for secrecy reasons. Still, it helped steady nerves to hear a pre‐battle speech, even if short. Indeed, Ryouko would have done the same to her platoon, if it weren\'t currently necessary to minimize transmission traffic.

Instead, she decided to take a visual look at the battle map, reviewing again the divisional and lower‐level objectives, mentally peering at both tiny details and broad strokes.

*We all familiar with the plan?* one of the girls queried, as they gathered in a quiet group, behind one of their powerful frontline point defense systems---also known as a PDS, because the military loved acronyms.

*Yes,* one of the others thought. *Ryouko here teleports us in behind the lines, we wreak havoc, tear about some point defenses and artillery, then carve our way back out. Meanwhile, the conventional forces hit them from the front. Susanna and Meiqing here stay behind to help them crack it.*

*It\'s always \'Ryouko, teleport this!\', \'Ryouko, teleport that!\', she groused. *Just once, I\'d like one of you to carry me there.*

That was followed by the telepathic equivalent of polite laughter, even as Ryouko swallowed a sudden bout of foreboding.

In truth, Ryouko was slightly proud. She had managed to show that her mass carrying limit was higher than she originally thought, and there was the suggestion that she might even be able to carry more, with time. This would still take two trips, but it was a meaningful difference.

*Anyway,* Ryouko thought, shaking off whatever weird feelings she might have had. *Those of you going with me get over here and touch me or each other. You know the drill. I could teleport you through the ground, but I\'d prefer not to. I\'ll take as many as I can.*

The group shifted closer to her as instructed. One of them began pulling mud golems out of the ground. An internal timer ticked downward towards zero. Ryouko took a breath---

---and she was there. She waited and watched, just long enough to see that everything was as planned: the barrier generator smashing aside any rapid response drones, mud golems running outward to smash at their target, this concentration of forcefield generators and point defense systems that protected the area from bombardment, one of the shocked alien guards already suborned by their domination‐class telepath, working quickly to turn weapons around towards the enemy. Asami reached out, smashing one generator into another, bits of debris flinging themselves toward what was now an ever‐growing clump. As they fought, their secondary backpacks opened, support drones scurrying out or taking to the air, to help contest the battlespace with the alien drones already there.

Ryouko shed a burst of magic, forcing off the alien anti‐personnel microdrones trying to bite into her, then teleported back to pick up the remaining half of the group.

*Ryouko!* someone relayed telepathically, the moment she arrived again.

She didn\'t need any further messaging, her tactical computer feeding her everything she needed to know. She blinked over to the girl making the request, then carried the two of them straight to the defense turrets in question, a hundred meters away.

The girl smashed her sword directly through one of the turrets, shield and all, then flung the other aside with a tremendous display of telekinetic force, carrying with it a set of defense drones that had been taken by surprise. Ryouko, for her part, shot an arrow she had ready through an approaching hovertrooper, and smashed her elbow into the neck of another on the ground---using a large burst of magic to melee through a light forcefield was one of the primary skills taught in training, though not everyone mastered it.

Ryouko had a moment to process the spectacle of her elbow shattering through layers of regenerative armor, glass‐like scales, rubbery flesh and brittle bone, green magic sparking, color almost indistinguishable from the bright green ichor. Just a moment to ponder the severed nerve cords, the bright metal implant wiring, and the life she had just taken.

Then she power‐kicked a ground drone that had tried to sneak up on her, and turned to look back at the other girls, just in time to spot Asami release the giant orb of smashed equipment she had been gathering in the air---the remains of what had been a large tower‐size stationary communications jammer.

The metal landed on the ground with a smash, followed by a sickening gush of fluids---the aliens used some biological parts in all their larger equipment, wherever the expense of the required biosupport was balanced out by the greater power efficiency.

*Primary objective is down,* Clarisse thought, reemphasizing what Ryouko could also see on other channels.

At that moment, with surprise dissipated, the main attack opened, less‐precise artillery shells raining down on now defenseless alien rear positions, while more precise guided projectiles and missiles tore into frontline fortifications, along with the firepower of long‐range mages firing from anti‐grav platforms. Without seeing it, Ryouko could easily imagine the stealth mages withdrawing from the heavy air forces, while the Aer Magi, heavy dive bombers, and fighters descended towards the alien positions, the most advanced mages operating in free flight, while most relied on some degree of technological support.

The ground shook underneath Ryouko, subtly different from the usual concussion of landing shells, and she knew that that meant Meiqing was attacking. In her mind\'s eye, Ryouko could see that her platoon was in action as well, the massive transmitters of the armor and support vehicles cutting through alien interference in the region for as long as they still held numerical superiority and were able to smash jamming devices.

While her platoon was part of the spearhead, the formation that would break the line so that support infantry could help hold the ground that they captured, their job was also to move heaven and earth to recover her if she got into trouble. She split her consciousness, just a little, to check on their status. Things seemed to be going fine, but they had five dead, six wounded. It wasn\'t realistic to ask for better than that, but these were men and women she had known and talked to.

She chose not to dwell on that.

She withdrew her attention, and refocused entirely on what they were currently doing. Their secondary objective was a nearby collection of alien self‐firing artillery, but they were already tearing through that with relative ease, the more physically‐powered girls bashing through forcefields with main force---such as a massive electric bolt---while the others applied varying degrees of artfulness in circumventing the forcefields. The AI‐controlled artillery simply didn\'t have enough personal defenses to counter them, nor where there sufficient infantry guards.

Ryouko, for her part, summoned her most powerful attack---a scorpion artillery piece---and smashed the projectile through three of the devices. The attack took a lot out of her---she felt tired after doing it---but the robotic arm in her bag could be relied on to apply grief cubes as needed. The attack felt novel, even though she must have done it dozens of times by now.

*Air support reports massed armor reserves in our immediate vicinity, trying to respond,* Elena thought. *We shouldn\'t give them the chance.*

There was a chorus of agreement, and though Ryouko would have loved to go along, she checked herself mentally, suppressing disappointment.

*This attack appears to have mostly succeeded,* Ryouko thought. Doctrine suggests that it is now safe for me to start teleporting my platoon members in, to give more meat to our shock and awe. Would it be alright if I left the armor to the rest of you? It\'s right next to us, after all.*

*First teleport us to the other side of that armor,* Elena thought. *For the surprise.*

*Alright,* Ryouko thought.

## To the Sky 

> *Magical Matter Manipulation* (colloquial: \"modding\") falls into three broadly defined classes, between which there can be significant overlap.
>
> *Conjuration* is the creation of physical objects *de novo* and is practiced by every magical girl to at least some degree, for instance in the summoning of costumes or weapons.
>
> *Adjustment* is the changing of the properties of an existing object, rendering it different in shape, composition, or structure, but without necessarily imbuing the object with any magical properties.
>
> *Enchantment* is the granting of magical properties to a particular object, granting the object non‐standard physical properties.
>
> All such manipulation may be performed on either a temporary or a permanent basis. The synthesis of matter from energy is costly, and the vast majority of manipulation is temporary, creating objects or performing modifications that disappear or revert when no longer needed. Such manipulations impose a continuous soul gem cost, but for short durations of time, and are far more cost‐effective than attempting to perform a permanent modification.
>
> The magical costs of matter manipulation can be divided into three parts. First is the summoning cost, which is essentially the pure matter‐energy cost of performing the manipulation. This is higher for permanent manipulations than temporary manipulations, is highest in conjurations, and lowest in adjustments.
>
> Second is the upkeep cost, the cost associated with using or maintaining the manipulation. This is associated fairly uniformly with all temporary manipulations, while generally being absent from permanent manipulations, with the notable exception that permanently enchanted objects cost magic to use, though they do not cost magic to maintain. Notably, upkeep cost often drops steeply with practice repeatedly summoning the same object, with most brand‐new girls capable of summoning at least a primary weapon cheaply.
>
> Finally, there is a complexity cost, associated with the difficulty of imposing complex order onto an object. It is in some ways analogous to an entropic cost. The more intricate an object, the more technologically advanced, or the more magically arcane, the greater the amount of time a mage must take performing the modification, and the greater the amount of energy used in keeping the object in a magically pliable state during this time. This cost is dependent heavily on the skill, intelligence, and experience of the mage performing the modification.
>
> Indeed, it is the complexity cost that provides much of the motivation for the permanent modification of objects, since it is a pointless waste of effort to build a temporary, vastly complex object. Permanent conjuration is rare, with most mages preferring the easier route of modifying an existing, similar object. Permanent adjustment was primarily used in the replication of high‐end equipment, and is now used by researchers attempting to push the technological envelope, though there was a brief vogue during the early MSY period of mages attempting to replicate entertainment devices for personal use.
>
> But it is permanent *enchantment* that is the most difficult and most valuable of modification tasks, with even the simplest permanent magical artifacts taking a prodigious amount of time and skill to construct. Consequently, such artifacts are rare, and rarely exit MSY secret storage. In the right hands, though, they can be extraordinarily valuable, despite their soul gem usage costs, because of their ability to grant the girls who wield them effective secondary powers that may have nothing to do with their primary power.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The counter‐counterattack, when it came, was hardly a surprise. The aliens still tried for surprise, though, because it was difficult to tell when a Human force had clairvoyant support. They did, though, and knew the attack was coming long before it happened.

The attack was devastating anyway. It always was. No one could match the squid in sheer brute force. The infantry died like flies, but army tactical doctrine was clear: hang on, buy time, keep the magical girls alive, and prepare a counterpunch.

Occasionally, if magical girl resources in the area were limited, that meant that they would withdraw to the rear for safety, and possibly to help prepare the counterpunch. Not here, though; they had the reserves necessary to counterpunch without pulling frontline platoons back, so they stayed committed to the front, doing their best to help contain breaches in the line. Ryouko would be expected to eschew risky direct attack tactics in favor of what the models said was a much more effective use of her power: \"mobility enhancement\", a euphemism designed to make the more blood‐thirsty teleporters feel better about themselves.

Ryouko had been told that she fell into that category, but the euphemism failed to make her feel any more dignified. A part of her constantly missed the satisfaction of successfully tearing targets in half with her teleport, or eviscerating them with her arrows. Sometimes, she reflected that since the aliens were clearly sentient, this meant she enjoyed killing.

She tried not to think about that much.

Still, though, she kept her complaints to herself, because it was palpably obvious how she was contributing to the battle. Every infantryman or magical girl or tank crew she bailed out of a hopeless situation was a life saved, just as much as if she had been a healer reattaching their heads, and her ability to do that enabled much bolder tactics from those in the area, such as counterattacking directly into the full fury of the alien assault. Her own platoon, in particular, was rather prone to over‐aggressiveness, though her second‐in‐command kept them from relying on her too much.

Still, she couldn\'t save everyone. The news that Sanchez was dead came as a minor gut punch. She tried to stay detached, thinking only that she would have to rearrange her promotion short list, but she had to admit it bothered her a little.

On the attack, it simply wasn\'t efficient for her to appear and try to do damage on her own. Far better to show up with others more capable of close‐range combat, or with much heavier damage outputs, while she personally saved her energy for an endless series of teleports. It was also, she had to admit, much safer.

There was also the value of maneuverability. Again and again, she was called upon to shift squads from position to position, from low ground to high ground, from strongpoint to weakpoint, to stabilize the line or, often, just to get things done faster. Her own platoon was considered an Extremely High Mobility unit, meaning that it was well within her power to transport the entire unit far faster than they could possibly move otherwise, even if it took her a tiresome number of trips to do so. Because of this, they rarely spent extended time in defensive positions, and were always being shifted back and forth.

It was, frankly, exhausting. Ryouko was constantly pushing the limits of how often she could teleport, and only Clarisse\'s monitoring gave her any idea how many grief cubes she was going through. It vastly exceeded how many she could have obtained from even the most productive of demon hunting runs.

Their counterpunch would never happen.

> \"*Orbital defenses significantly compromised. Orbital bombardment inbound.*\"

Evacuation meant, of course, that teleporters and their associated companies and battalions would take a starring role, pulling MGs back to transport ships as fast as possible, with only the slightest attention to paid to the impact on the remaining troops. Defense lines contracted as much as possible while trying not to present obvious bombardment targets. Grief cube supply lines took on sudden enormous priority. In short, the military focused on evacuating its core assets at the expense of everything else.

And Ryouko wouldn\'t be doing any of the fighting. Instead, she would be teleporting constantly back and forth with members of her platoon and other MGs, pulling out MG after MG of her corps to evacuation areas. It bothered her, on some deep level. It was also a bit like running a marathon without implant support.

She appeared this time next to an artillery piece, invisible again, pressing her stealth to last *just a little bit longer.* With her, she brought the entirety of the surviving members of Squad B, which was down to five members, and several other MGs of her battalion, her designated defenders.

*This group of artillery must survive!* a telepathic voice shouted at her the moment she arrived. *Without it, the sector will collapse!*

This came from a girl in front of them, levitated high enough in the air that she was half‐concealed by the tangled mess of the greenery above, high enough that she could look down upon the canopy from within the faint yellow glow that enveloped her. She seemed dangerously exposed, and Ryouko zoomed in to get a better look, while some of the other girls advanced their way up the trees in the area, one running up the length of one of the artillery gun barrels.

*It no longer matters,* Zhen, her patrol commander, responded. *The sector is now clear of MGs. You\'re the last. Check your updated map.*

The girl in question didn\'t respond immediately, instead turning midair and looking somewhere behind her. A brief glow in her eyes, a gesture of the hands, and an angry yellow fireball appeared in the sky in the distance, landing explosively in the ground.

*I can\'t leave,* she thought. *My men are down there.*

*Without you to guard,* Zhen argued, *they\'ll be more free to withdraw in an orderly---*

The ground shifted noticeably underneath them, sending a cascade of leaves floating out of the sky.

Ryouko and the others glanced automatically at Meiqing, before realizing that that made little sense.

They tensed, looking around hastily. Orbital bombardment? No, that would be more sustained. This was---

*Over there,* the girl in the sky thought.

They turned in unison to face a new marker that had suddenly appeared on their maps, relayed directly from her.

*Non‐conventional source. Unknown class. Visual estimate of yield: Megaton.*

Now they could all see the obvious mushroom cloud rising in the distance, and feel the faint heat radiated from its direction. Heat... and something else. EM radiation.

*Look at that estimated location,* Asami thought, clearly shocked. Aren\'t some of our battalion in that sector? Who do you think set it off?*

*Either someone\'s antinuclear defenses fell down on the job, or someone decided to throw some antimatter at the problem,* Ryouko thought, grimly.

*Did we even have antimatter on this planet?* Asami thought.

*No idea,* Meiqing thought.

A flash of yellow light landed next to Ryouko, drawing their attention.

As they turned to look, the light solidified back into the girl they had seen up in the sky.

\"I\'ll go,\" she said simply.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Second Division assumes command of units of former Fourth Division... Sixth Division to hold Yucatan‐Point 514 front as long as possible... Support Company D to withdraw to Point 118... updated best‐knowledge command structure is as follows...*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The orange girl leapt impossibly high into the sky, almost a blur even to Ryouko\'s eyes. She twirled in midair, sliced an alien missile clean in half, then propelled herself back to the ground so she wouldn\'t stay in the air as a target.

*I\'m not sure how much longer we can keep this up,* Ngo Thi An thought, from somewhere within their group. *My soul gem is draining too fast. Soon we\'ll have no more grief cubes.*

*We\'ll make do with what we have,* Zhen thought. *We have to. The reserves are empty. Keep your cool. Remember your training.*

Zhen was their new battalion commander, now that Elena Santiago was dead, caught in the nuclear blast, which had decidedly *not* been friendly. It was shocking, to think of the Lieutenant Colonel as dead, but Ryouko refused to let herself dwell. She couldn\'t; there was just no time.

*We must establish drone contact with the troops in this pocket,* Zhen continued, talking as a way of keeping them all calm. *There are at least two mages trapped within this pocket. We must find them. If we search systematically---*

She cut off, sensing, as they all did, the incoming shockwave.

*Orbital artillery!* someone broadcast, unnecessarily.

As a teleporter, Ryouko was among the best equipped to dodge such an attack, but she had a duty, an obligation to try to get the others out as well. She emptied her mind, her TacComp plotting out an optimal extraction‐teleport pattern---move from group of girls to group of girls, picking up three or four and pulling them out of the radius of the bombardment strike, so that she carried as many as once without being forced to stand too long in one spot, with minimal travel distance in between. No time for touching; it would be done through the ground.

Blink---

And a brace of trees exploded in splintering lumber directly in front of her, but it was okay; it was okay because it hadn\'t landed on top of her, or she would have been forced to continue and the wide‐eyed Asami in front of her would be dead.

Blink---

And she found the orange girl with a sword, watching the sky with wide eyes, hoping she could dodge fast enough. They looked at each other.

Blink---

She found Meiqing hidden under a half‐dome of earth, surroundings dank and gloomy, her face covered in dirt.

It seemed interminable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Two casualties,* Clarisse thought, once it was over. *Susana Miller is dead. Zhen is dead. She designated the teleporter---you---as her successor, in case of incapacitation. It---Wait.*

Clarisse stopped, and there was no need to explain why. Ryouko had already teleported where she needed to, carrying two other girls in tow.

They found Ngo Thi An kneeling in the soil staring at her own hands. Next to her, a girl lay unconscious on the ground---one of the girls they had been looking for.

The healer next to Ryouko crouched down and thrust forward a grief cube, to tend to Ngo, whose status was flashing critical in their monitors, but it was too late; the girl\'s body was already fading before their eyes.

*She was disabled by one of the shockwaves... I thought I could protect her,* Ngo the barrier generator thought, one last time. *I guess I didn\'t have enough juice.*

When the girl vanished entirely, the girl with the grief cube murmured some sort of prayer and moved to work on the other girl, prone on the ground.

Ryouko blinked away tears. She had to hold on.

*What now?* Meiqing thought, somewhere distant, without bothering to append \"*acting‐Commander*\".

*I--I designated Nakihara Asami as my successor,* she thought. *And---*

She thought desperately about what had just happened, their three casualties, the girl injured in front of them, the second girl that was supposed to be here somewhere, the pocket that had probably been critically compromised by the bombardment---

*We\'re getting out of here,* she thought. *To me.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Defend the evacuation shuttles at all costs... remaining units are reminded of their oaths and families... Humanity salutes your sacrifice.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Is that the last of them?* Ryouko thought. *Are we done?*

*We\'ve still got units stranded throughout the region,* Clarisse thought, repeating what she already knew. *But the MGs are out. It\'s time for the evac teams to pull out.*

Ryouko grabbed her last remaining grenades, enchanted them, and shotput them in the general direction of some alien infantry, trusting her magical guidance to navigate them through the trees and underbrush.

*We have to hold!* she thought, both telepathically and over all her command channels. *This whole sector is now crawling with the enemy. Buy me time to pull you guys out!*

She threw up a group countdown timer, indicating how long she estimated it would take her to charge up to travel the necessary distance.

Without explicit acknowledgment, the others moved to fulfill her request, Meiqing raising a giant wall of earth to delay the alien advance, Asami lifting herself into the air and gesturing at trees, snapping them to form more of the barricade. Then, with a mutual effort, they shoved the giant mass down onto an advancing alien column. Hopefully it would hold.

Several others took final potshots, then headed for her as the timer wound down.

Without even waiting for them all to establish direct contact, she blinked away the moment a nearly maximal number of girls approached her. She appeared in the evacuation zone, dozens of kilometers away, directly in front of one of the shuttles, a layer of teleported dirt now covering the ground.

She took a moment to look around, looking at the others while charging up for the jump back, laboring against a deep sense of tiredness that was probably due to her darkening soul gem.

Then she went back for the rest.

The first thing she saw was Asami---or rather, pieces of her---falling out of the sky.

She instinctively stepped forward, eyes widening as she tried to zoom in.

Before she could try to teleport upwards, though, the knowledge hit her, confirmed by local transmissions---she was dead.

*Initiating low‐level emotional suppression,* Clarisse thought, before she even had time to think.

A curious sense of detachment wafted through her, so that even as she was struck by the shock, anger, and pain, she was able to force herself to stop and evaluate her situation, even as her friend\'s body began to land in the moss with muted, yet sickening, thuds.

She didn\'t question Clarisse\'s decision, even if it was likely to substantially reduce her ability to draw on her soul gem\'s power. If even now a part of her wanted to charge into the nearest clump of aliens and *kill everything* until there was *nothing **left** to kill*... then it was unlikely that her unmoderated reaction would have been well‐reasoned, especially given that her soul gem---now at approximately was starting to weigh on her reasoning abilities.

She teleported to cover somewhere to her right, getting out of the open, and observed the situation. A mass of heavy alien armor had arrived, blasting their way through and hovering over the barricade as if it were nothing, too much firepower too suddenly for Asami to survive, even with her soul gem cover.

The lead tanks turned their bulbous laser turrets in her direction, starting to glow with a charge---

Suddenly, they shattered in a barrage of explosions, sending up the debris and sparks of sudden forcefield failure, splattered green with the blood of processing pods.

*Go! Get out of here!* one of the infantry exhorted, armored frame lifting one of the heavy anti‐tank lasers. *We\'ll cover you!*

Ryouko didn\'t bother asking where the air support was. Most of it was in pieces on the jungle floor.

The few remaining magical girls in the area rapidly converged on her position. She noted that most of them were also under emotional suppression.

Ryouko issued mental orders, ordering all the infantry, both from her platoon and others, in her immediate proximity to converge. She would take as many as she could, then come back for the rest.

*No,* she was surprised to hear her warrant officer say. *Belay that. The situation is too hot. We can\'t shorten our perimeter without presenting a target for bombardment. Hold your positions. Get out of here, sir. Respectfully.*

The emotion of the voice shone through clearly in the content and volume of the words, despite the much more substantial combat dampening that the infantry practically never turned off.

*There\'s still time on the counter,* Ryouko said, shocked, still trying to prepare a teleport. *I am ordering---*

*No,* the man responded. *That\'s the wrong order, and you know it. You\'re supposed to leave us. So leave us. Don\'t come back.*

*But I can\'t*--- Ryouko began.

*We are here because we have nothing left to us,* the man said. *We are here because we decided we would give our lives, if necessary. We are the dead; you are not.*

*He\'s right,* Meiqing thought, appearing at Ryouko\'s side. *You know he\'s right. Think about everyone else who had to leave their men behind today.*

Ryouko clenched her teeth, a twinge of emotion piercing into her mind, defying the emotional suppression.

\"Asami‐chan is dead,\" she said out loud, without realized she had slipped into her native Japanese. \"She\'s dead, and I can\'t even get her body. So many dead. My men are counting on me. I can\'t---\"

\"I know,\" Meiqing said, wrapping an arm around her shoulder, Japanese stilted from instant translation. \"I left mine behind at Tupi. But we have to go. They\'re counting on you to *live.*\"

Ryouko nodded, head down, still charging a teleport.

\"Things keep happening and I don\'t even have time to think about what happened,\" she said. \"My soul gem---is my soul gem failing? Maybe that\'s it.\"

*Get that armor off their backs!* the sergeant shouted, somewhere distant. *I don\'t care what it takes! You know what is expected of you. We will fight to the last joule and the last round. Until then, you do not have my permission to die. Lieutenant, don\'t come back. You hear me? Don\'t come---*

And then she blinked out.

She fell onto her knees, and caught a brief blurry glimpse of the bottom of the evacuation shuttle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**〈Exit to lobby.〉**

Ryouko\'s eyes snapped open, and for a brief moment she was essentially paralyzed in her chair, staring up at the girl looking down at her with profound confusion.

*Steady,* Clarisse counseled. *Steady. It will all make sense in a moment.*

Then it all came rushing back. Memories kept forcibly suppressed by constant stimulation reemerged, while others that had never really existed faded away, except for---what did they call it? A meta‐memory. The memory of a memory.

It all made sense, all of a sudden. The headaches, the creeping sense of almost‐*déjà vu* that had bothered her every time she came close to thinking about the truth, or thought too hard about events that had never really happened.

*Recalibration complete,* Clarisse thought.

Ryouko immediately jumped out of her wooden chair, smothering Asami with a deep embrace.

\"You\'re alive!\" she said.

\"Ah, yes,\" Asami said, surprised by the unexpected intimacy.

A pause.

\"Are--are you fully recalibrated?\" she asked, skeptical, referring to the process of dampening the emotional importance of the false memories. "That wasn\'t real---\"

\"Yeah, I know,\" Ryouko said, releasing the other girl but holding onto her shoulders. \"Just needed to burn off some emotional juice.\"

Then she dropped her arms, realizing how *tired* she was.

\"I hate these damn things,\" she said. \"They\'re terrible, and I\'m exhausted.\"

\"I know,\" Asami said. \"We should go sleep. I hung around to wait for you. It was only a couple of seconds, actually.\"

Ryouko took a moment to look around, at the nondescript wooden waiting room that served as a simulation transition lobby, in case you exited a simulation \"poorly\"---for instance, in the middle of a punch or scream, though with modern techniques it was mostly a theoretical risk. Some people decorated or changed their personal lobbies, but she had yet to bother. She had yet to enter a VR simulation on her own initiative, so she had yet to have any need to hang around in her lobby, fiddling with settings or whatnot.

She took a breath, nodding at the other girl.

Then they dissolved.

**〈Simulation terminated.〉**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko found herself in yet another chair, this time a pitch‐black VR chair, just one of many that filled the room she was in, arrayed in rows.

She rubbed the back of her neck where the I/O devices had only recently detached, stretched her arms out above her head, then pulled a lollipop out of her mouth. It was fresh; someone had replaced it.

She stood up.

\"What was it like, dying in the simulation?\" she asked, turning to the girl getting up from the chair to her right. \"Without any idea that it was fake, I mean.\"

She personally had never had that experience.

Asami furrowed her brow for a moment, putting her hand to her chin.

\"Not that bad,\" she said, finally. \"They deliberately don\'t simulate the process in any detail; they just sort of kick you out, and it was an instantaneous shatter anyway. That\'s what my TacComp said. Of course, it might have helped that it was pumping emergency neurotransmitters to keep me from panicking when I woke. I was sort of numb.\"

Ryouko nodded.

Asami turned her head, and Ryouko followed her gaze to a girl who was apparently standing next to them. How long had she been there?

Meiqing looked at the two of them, then raised both her hands, palm outward.

\"I just wanted to reassure you that I can keep things to myself. Let\'s have lunch together later, okay?\"

\"Sure,\" Ryouko said, returning the offer of friendship.

\"I\'m going to go sleep,\" the girl said. \"I\'m exhausted.\"

\"Yeah, us too,\" Ryouko said.

The girl turned and walked away, nodding at Elena Santiago, standing by the door. She was one of the officers who oversaw the process.

In the late stages of training, they had been running these simulations nearly nonstop, alternating long stretches of repeated runs with occasional multi‐hour sleep breaks. Simulations run in accelerated time were physically and mentally draining, and the only way to sustain the pace was to use magic to restore fitness between simulations.

Sleeping during the breaks was not mandatory, but was strongly recommended, and most girls followed the recommendation. There was still the occasional person who went crazy after too long with no sleep, and while there was no good direct evidence that one caused the other, and the individuals in question were generally unstable to start with, the correlation was apparent enough for the military to issue the recommendation. No one wanted to test whether a month in simulation would have the same effect, even with magic to help make things better.

Thinking back to what happened during simulations was like viewing your own past through an extra sepia filter. The false memories and experiences given to you within a simulation were designed to be at least superficially plausible---Ryouko thought that it was like experiencing a possible future. Because of this, thinking back to simulations was a little bit like viewing someone else\'s memories. The Ryouko in the simulation had had a long history of caring for and fighting with her platoon. Even if on close inspection the full emotional depth was missing, it had colored and informed her actions.

Despite the arguably lower quality of the memories, their collective effect was palpable. They had spent the equivalent of nearly a month of time fighting and working together, in hundreds of different situations. In that time, she had seen others die, seen others break down, and had held multiple hours‐long conversations with Asami, prodding decorative campfires with sticks, in the long interludes between battles. She had watched relationships between the others made and broken and remade again, the interpersonal dynamics somehow consistent over dozens of wildly differing scenarios.

The training manuals said that training cohorts, or members of them, at least, often bonded deeply, the resulting camaraderie carrying over long after the training period ended. Ryouko could definitely believe that now, and she found herself thinking about Asaka, Patricia, and Alice. Suddenly the whole story made a lot more sense. She suspected that the simulation planners deliberately clustered compatible girls together with greater than random frequency.

*Come think of it, I\'ve been running into Meiqing rather frequently, she thought.

\"What do you suppose she meant by the keeping things to herself comment?\" Asami asked, when Meiqing finally left earshot.

\"I\'d rather not talk about it,\" Ryouko said, shaking her head. "Let\'s just go.\"

They had ended up roommates, which Ryouko decidedly refused to believe was a coincidence.

\"You know,\" Asami said, as they walked down the hall, passing other exhausted‐looking girls heading for their respective rooms. \"I\'ve been thinking about something, so I asked my TacComp. I wasn\'t sure how they were faking magical telepathy, since we can tell the difference from the other kind. It turns out: they\'re not faking anything. We do it the same way we always do, but from our chairs, outside the simulation. That\'s pretty clever.\"

\"Yeah, that\'s interesting,\" Ryouko said blandly, not wanting to point out that she had asked that particular question hours ago---though those hours were really more like weeks. She did wonder how exactly they accelerated the telepathy...

Passing a window, she slowed to a stop. Here at the training center, they were far from New Athens\'s city centers, or even their suburbs. Instead, the view presented to her was of idyllic farmland. In the foreground, there were practice areas and firing ranges. In the background were enormous fields of genetically‐engineered wheat waving in the wind, carefully tended to by machines. When she and Asami had first seen it, they had stopped and stared; it had been such a novel sight to someone from the cities of Earth, used to eating synthesized food. Indeed, it turned out that synthesized food was only common on Earth, and to some degree on the other Core Worlds. Without Earth\'s elaborate setup of solar‐orbiting satellites, energy wasn\'t freely available enough to justify the expense.

She had seen very little of this world except what they had seen from their landing shuttle and the training facility, but she could already tell that the colonies were very different from Earth.

It was disappointing, then, that she had spent all the time since then cooped up in this training center.

They had been here nearly a week. The week had been filled to the absolute brim with training exercises, there being no need for any of them to sleep extensively. First had come the cortical datadump, designed to fill them with the basic terminology and weapons knowledge they would need to function. It had been so large it required special equipment to transmit efficiently, and had left them reeling with brains full of newfound knowledge.

Then came skills instruction, the new girls separated into groups by skill category, to spend quality accelerated simulation time with instructors who had their particular powerset, learning the ins and outs of effective tactics used by others of their class, combined with exhortations to experiment when possible, both in simulations and on the practice grounds. They had learned about the skills database, which contained recorded data about the maneuvers used by magical girls past.

Back in the real world, they had been taught the basics of extending their magical powers, with each of them expected to learn a few basic skills, if they did not already have them: low‐level self‐propulsion, a magically charged melee attack. Then, for those with particular affinities, further extensions: minor clairvoyance to enhance dodging, the beginnings of telekinesis, projecting waves of force from melee weapons, modifying your projectiles to home in on targets, basic enchantment, and so forth.

They were also instructed briefly on experimentation; Ryouko, in particular, spent time trying to understand why her soul gem had glowed near a starship\'s FTL core. She got Asami to try her best to replicate the relevant gravitational conditions and, while they managed to induce a faint glow, it brought her little closer to the answer.

Finally, they were taught to use their magic to overcome minor physical limitations such as, for instance, mental exhaustion. They were forced to stay underwater, and use their magic to extract oxygen from the water. They were placed in vacuum chambers, and carefully tutored in preventing the formation of inconvenient internal gas bubbles, on repairing anoxic damage, and on protecting soft tissues; ideally, they would conjure the necessary oxygen, but that training would be saved for those joining the *MC.*

That went on for nearly three days *straight,* and then it was back into simulation time, with its endless variety of lessons and classroom instruction. Test‐firing weapons, practice on a virtual firing range, culminating in lessons on command and control, which focused a lot more on interhuman interaction than she would have expected. These were followed by exercises commanding a virtual platoon in the field, along with practice maneuvering and coordinating with each other. They then held full‐fledged skirmishes, commanding units and fighting against both each other and simulated aliens, secure in the knowledge that death in the simulation would be painless.

Finally, the part they had quietly dreaded: realistic simulation, with memories fabricated. Incredibly illegal outside a military context, the military had in fact seized the technology from illegal VR gamers.

Exiting her reverie, Ryouko looked up.

The sky of New Athens was a pristine blue. Too blue, in fact, from a combination of a slightly different atmosphere and slightly different solar output. The sun seemed too harsh, and the length of day was different, too, and it was still strange adjusting to the disparity between local time and absolute Earth time, which was calibrated based on FTL signals. She had never quite grasped how that worked with regards to relativity and causality.

\"You\'re always thinking about something,\" Asami said, looking at her from the corner of her eye. \"Just enjoy the beautiful day.\"

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko agreed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*So if I may interrupt your descent into unconsciousness,* Clarisse began. *I thought you might want some entertainment before your nap. Well, maybe entertainment. Your actual reaction will be informative to my prediction subroutines.*

Ryouko had just collapsed into her bed, clothing on, with every intention of falling asleep on the spot. She rolled over, slightly annoyed.

*What is it?*

*Get Nakihara‐san\'s attention,* the device thought. *You can read the messages together. I think it\'ll be enlightening.*

*Read the messages together,* Ryouko thought flatly, doing her best to convey her skepticism.

*Yes,* Clarisse thought.

Ryouko thought about resisting, then decided it wasn\'t worth it. She sat up, allowing the covers to slide down the front of her shirt. She looked over at the girl in the bed on the other side of the narrow room, lying facing the opposite wall. Her eyes wandered onto their two dress uniforms stacked on the desk: neat, compact, and almost unused. Asami had insisted earlier on dressing up and taking pictures to send home. Ryouko wondered when, if ever, magical girls ever wore the damn things.

Next to the uniforms, two CubeBots peered at her curiously, one perched on top of the other for no apparent reason. Ryouko had thought herself unusual for bringing one, but it turned out that a surprising number of the new recruits had done so as well. No wonder her request to bring it had gone through so easily.

*She\'s not asleep,* Clarisse thought. *I can tell from the infrared.*

*Alright, geez,* Ryouko thought, admitting she had been procrastinating.

\"Asami‐chan,\" she said.

The girl made an annoyed sleepy noise, before turning over and looking at her with half‐opened eyes.

\"What is it?\" she asked.

\"I have something to show you. Get up.\"

Asami sat up slowly, untied hair falling over her eyes.

\"This better be exciting,\" she mumbled, finally, sheets halfway up her body.

\"Clarisse says it is.\"

The girl pushed her way out of her bedsheets, bare feet contacting the carpeting. Unlike Ryouko, Asami made a point of changing into pajamas before each and every nap.

Asami strode the few steps over to Ryouko\'s bed and sat down next to her.

\"Well, what is it?\" she asked.

Ryouko was a bit bothered by the closeness, but at least she had nothing to be jealous of.

She felt Asami\'s gaze on her, suddenly. She hadn\'t noticed her staring, had she?

\"Is something the matter?\" Ryouko asked, deciding to bluff it out.

\"Oh, no, nothing,\" Asami said, looking down. \"I was just wondering what was taking you so long.\"

Ryouko turned around on her bed, putting her legs up, staring meaningfully at the wall that had been behind her, which lit up.

\"It\'s these messages I just got,\" Ryouko said. \"Clarisse is displaying it. She\'s trying to keep it all mysterious, for some reason.\"

Asami looked at her. The girl was the only one who knew Ryouko was carrying nonstandard equipment, but Ryouko wasn\'t sure she realized the implications of that.

\"You\'re starting to talk like your TacComp is some sort of person,\" she pointed out. \"Are the Version Twos really that different?\"

\"They\'re, uh, interesting,\" Ryouko hedged.

The wall in front of them began to scroll the text of the first message. The first thing Ryouko noticed was the unusual formatting: it looked formal and typeset, and even came with its own fancy border and font, contrasting with the simple text that constituted most messages. It even had a seal! This didn\'t mean much in terms of effort---machines could do it for you easily---but it did indicate how the sender wanted to be perceived. It was especially unusual, given that the sender surely knew that many people would choose to listen to the message instead, or would have it overlaid on their vision while doing something else. Neither situation was conducive to fancy formatting.

\"The message came with instructions that the sender would prefer it be read on a physical interface,\" Clarisse said, voice emanating from the wall panel.

Ryouko and Asami both startled, Asami\'s elbow brushing against hers. The voice was, after all, Ryouko\'s.

\"Ah, sorry,\" Clarisse said. \"I thought you\'d both want to hear it.\"

\"It has your voice?\" Asami asked, looking at Ryouko incredulously.

\"I didn\'t have a choice,\" Ryouko said. \"It was mandatory.\"

\"That\'s incredibly creepy,\" Asami said.

\"Yeah, that\'s what I thought too,\" Ryouko said, looking to her side. "But I got used to it. It\'s not that bad.\"

\"If they\'re really issuing upgrades soon, it\'s going to be really weird,\" Asami said.

There was a moment of awkward silence as they thought about whether to continue the line of conversation.

Ryouko decided not to, focusing again on the message. It read:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sender: Guillaume François

Pleasant Greetings,

Firstly, allow me to congratulate you on your recent contract. I have heard only the highest of your abilities, and have no doubt that you will prove a credit to your family lines.

I hope you will pardon the forwardness of this missive, but as I am sure you are aware, with the recent news regarding your esteemed lineage, there will be no shortage of those who seek your company. In sending this, I am hoping to get my \"foot in the door\", so to speak, and I hope I am not being off‐putting.

I am not so tawdry as to suppose that familial considerations will be sufficient for something such as this, even if such an alliance would be of significant mutual benefit. Rather, I propose that we arrange a virtual meeting...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko stopped reading there, her face having shifted by stages into almost a caricature of astonishment, as she recognized the message for what it was: a relationship proposal.

\"That\'s message one of two,\" Clarisse said. \"The second one has the same purpose, though it is less eccentric.\"

\"Why--why on Earth---\" Ryouko stammered.

\"Huh, so it\'s begun this early,\" Asami said, pursing her lips, looking not so much surprised as annoyed. \"The warnings were correct.\"

Ryouko stopped, taking a breath to steady herself.

\"You don\'t seem very surprised,\" she said, eyes narrowing. "Warnings?\"

\"Yeah,\" Asami said, looking at her. \"Everyone here is aware of your background and mentorship. Some of them are jealous, though they mostly don\'t show it. Others have been trying to get your attention. People tell me I\'m lucky to be your roommate. You--you haven\'t noticed, have you?\"

The last sentence was directed at Ryouko\'s blank look of surprise.

\"No,\" she said. \"I haven\'t.\"

Asami looked down at her feet, and the knees that she had bunched up against her chest.

\"I shouldn\'t be surprised,\" she said. \"I know what that\'s like. I probably wouldn\'t have noticed either, if people weren\'t so aggressive about telling me. I wonder if their advice is really sound.\"

\"Advice?\" Ryouko asked.

Asami seemed to think for a moment.

\"Well, you\'re going to be getting a lot more of these,\" Asami said, still looking down. \"That\'s what they said. Apparently, they should have been beating at you and your parents\' door your whole life, except you were such a secret for so long. Lots of competition, I guess. You interested at all?\"

\"Uh, no,\" Ryouko said. \"Probably not. It\'s way too early, right?\"

\"Yeah, probably,\" Asami said.

The girl got off Ryouko\'s bed, heading back towards her own.

\"That *was* exciting,\" she said. \"But I think I\'m going to sleep now.\"

\"Okay,\" Ryouko said, staring at the way the other girl\'s shoulder blades protruded slightly.

It was too early, of course, but it bothered her that these things were starting to intrude on her life. She---

Well, she hadn\'t put any thought into it, really. What was it Asami had said earlier?

\"*I think it just happens to you. One day you just* care. *And then you\'ll be surprised by what you notice. That\'s what they say, anyway. Hasn\'t happened to me.*\"

The voice rang out in her head, the memory played back by Clarisse without prompting.

Well, it hadn\'t happened yet, anyway, Ryouko thought. Speaking of Clarisse:

*Why on Earth did you make me include Asami‐chan in this?* Ryouko thought, finally remembering to ask the question. *This would have been much better done privately.*

*I thought it\'d be a good idea if she knew,* Clarisse thought. *Among other things, she might have had some useful insight, as proved to be the case.*

*Did you know about all that stuff she was talking about?* Ryouko thought.

*I suspected,* Clarisse thought, *though I didn\'t think she would spontaneously start talking to you about it. I was planning to push it in that direction. I would have eventually said something, if this opportunity hadn\'t arisen.*

*Humph,* Ryouko thought, aggrieved. *Do all you Version Twos hide information like this? It doesn\'t seem fair, given that you read my thoughts all the time.*

*We\'re programmed to try not to overwhelm you with too many things at once,* Clarisse thought. *We\'re programmed to promote emotional health, promote healthy relationships, all of that. It\'s what distinguishes us from the previous model.*

*Is there anything else you\'re trying not to \'overwhelm\' me with? Ryouko thought sarcastically.

*Well, for one thing, have you considered whether or not you\'re going to be in the Soul Guard?*

Ryouko blinked.

*No,* she thought. *I hadn\'t. Isn\'t that kind of thing done by assignment?*

*Yes,* Clarisse thought. *And, in the normal course of things, you probably would be, based on your unusual powers. However, your apprenticeship with Mami changes things. She needs to keep you out of Guard command structure, since she probably intends to place you somewhere in her command staff, and she is technically not a member of the Guard. Ordinarily, it\'d be a loss of prestige, but in this case, everyone will understand why.*

*Hmm,* Ryouko acknowledged.

*I would have been surprised had you been placed in the Guard, but I was waiting until a better moment to tell you. Otherwise, it\'d just be a random prediction on my part, and you hardly have a lot of time nowadays. Speaking of which, would it not be best to take a nap at this point?*

Ryouko sighed. She was too tired to argue with the device at this moment in time. She really did need to sleep.

*Fine,* she thought. *But this isn\'t the end of this.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Hey, Ryouko‐chan,\" Asami said, after they woke up again, before they were obliged to get up for the next round of simulations.

\"What is it?\" Ryouko asked, not bothering to shift from her current position, face up in her bed. She had been thinking about her ranking scores in the most recent rounds of simulations. Very high.

\"We\'re almost done, aren\'t we?\" Asami said, voice airy. \"Just one more day of this, and we go on our first practice run.\"

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko said dryly. \"A week of garrison duty on a secondary world somewhere. Doesn\'t sound terribly exciting.\"

\"I could use some boredom, after all these simulations,\" Asami said.

\"Yeah, me too,\" Ryouko agreed. \"But you know, personally I don\'t think it\'s all that close. We\'ve got maybe a week\'s worth of simulation time left. Sure, it doesn\'t really seem that long after you\'re done with it, but Clarisse says that\'s a deliberate temporal perception illusion. When you\'re actually in the simulation itself, it really is a week. You should probably think of it that way.\"

There was a long pause. Ryouko thought the conversation over, but then Asami said, finally:

\"During garrison duty, we\'re going to learn our initial assignments,\" she said. \"What do you think are the chances that we end up stationed together?\"

Ryouko turned and looked at the other bed, but the girl wasn\'t looking in her direction.

\"I don\'t know,\" she said. \"I have an idea of where I\'m going, but I have no idea what they\'d do with you. Honestly...\"

She paused, trying to think it through.

\"I think they might mark you out for the *MC,*\" Ryouko said. \"With a power like gravity, it seems likely.\"

\"Space combat?\" Asami asked rhetorically. \"I\'d really rather not. I want to see planets. And would I really be ready for that?\"

\"They give you an extra week of training after your initial assignment if you\'re designated for the *MC,*\" Ryouko said. \"That\'s what the archives say, after all.\"

\"I---\" Asami began.

Ryouko listened to herself breathe, in the brief silence.

\"I don\'t have any assurance I\'ll get my dreams fulfilled,\" Asami said. \"I know a lot of girls here are at least confident of that. I... I wished for my parents to stay together, to finally understand each other so that they wouldn\'t separate. I couldn\'t stand to see them so unhappy with each other, and, you know, I have my younger brother to think about.\"

From her position in the other bed, Ryouko couldn\'t quite read Asami\'s face, which was concealed by the contours of her blankets.

\"It\'s kind of funny,\" Asami said. \"I worded my wish carefully, so that it wouldn\'t change their personalities, so it wouldn\'t be some kind of mind‐control. Even so, I can\'t bring myself to tell them what my wish was. They don\'t remember fighting anymore. The memories are gone. Only my brother and I remember.\"

Again, there was silence, and Ryouko knew she was expected to say something in return.

\"I wished to travel the stars,\" she said. \"I wanted to go where no one else has, and I wanted to find my place in the universe. I don\'t think my wish was as selfless as yours.\"

\"Hmm,\" the other girl vocalized, before sighing, tired.

\"I feel greedy,\" Asami said. \"I\'ve had my wish, and now I want more. I don\'t regret what I wished for, but now I have other things I want.\"

\"You can try for them anyway,\" Ryouko said. \"It doesn\'t have to be from a wish.\"

\"I know,\" Asami said. \"Maybe I\'ll think of a way.\"

The conversation lulled, and this time it was Ryouko who said:

\"We should sleep.\"

> ##### Shizuki Ryouko 
>
> -   **Age: Gender:** *Female Occupation:** *Magical Girl Date of Contract:** *September 16, Rank:** *Second Lieutenant Home planet:** *Earth Status:** *Active, MG Basic Training Mentors:** *Tomoe Mami, Field Marshal. Sakura Kyouko, Lieutenant General.*
>
> ***Relevant Background:***
>
> Pre‐contract academics were somewhat above‐average, without any remarkable contribution to any particular field. Pre‐contract online activities were sufficient to warrant Level One security monitoring, but this is considered unimportant.
>
> ***Assessment:***
>
> In initial simulations Lieutenant Shizuki has shown an excellent grasp of combat tactics and strategy, with a clear understanding of most technical and organizational aspects of ground combat. Her performance in direct combat is innovative, making effective use of powers which are otherwise relatively ill‐suited for personal combat. Performance in tactical command roles is above average, though lacking in natural leadership skills. Performance in strategic command roles is likewise above average.
>
> Despite an apparently comprehensive understanding of tactical doctrine, Shizuki has shown a disturbing tendency toward over‐aggression in attack‐and‐destroy situations, including a relative disregard for personal safety. Further, she has shown an excessive unwillingness to sacrifice assets when necessary, preferring to commit herself and others to unsafe rescue attempts, though this tendency is more pronounced in tactical rather than strategic contexts. While she shows an ability to recognize irretrievable situations, these behaviors degrade her overall command potential.
>
> ***Recommendation:***
>
> Commitment to either field command or strategic command promotion tracks, preferably as a staff officer with specialist/support obligations. Exposure to direct combat is not recommended. Full commitment to specialist track would be waste of some talents. Possible exception: special operations, where aggression and unwillingness to sacrifice may prove assets instead of liabilities.

#### Appendix B: \"VR Simulation\" 

> One of the most novel aspects of modern military is the heavy, nearly total use of virtual reality (VR) simulation for training purposes. Nearly every piece of traditional training equipment has been obviated by the use of simulation, and the vast majority of training is carried out in VR. Not only does this conserve resources, it also conserves time,* due to the critical ability of VR to provide accelerated subjective time to its users. This time acceleration is pushed to its absolute limits by the modern military, with everything from weapons training to field maneuvers to classroom instruction carried out virtually, simply because it\'s *faster.*
>
> In addition, VR simulation also allows for *better* types of training, permitting recruits to be placed in grandiose combat environments that could not possibly be replicated in a real world training environment. Perhaps most critically, death in a virtual simulation is meaningless, so recruits can be thrown right into the firestorm of simulated combat without concern for their lack of experience. Such training substantially reduces initial battlefield casualties. Indeed, in its quest for greater and greater realism, and better and better training methodologies, the military is unencumbered by the majority of civilian regulations, leaving it free to use technologies and methods that are explicitly and severely illegal outside of a training context, many borrowed from the underground gaming industry.
>
> Only a few activities still require \"hands‐on\" instruction, most notably the development of magical girl powers, which are notoriously hard to simulate properly. Extensive cortical monitoring has, over time, allowed the replication of the unique sensory experience of power usage, but users still report sensations of \"wrongness\" during VR simulations.
>
> Overall, accelerated time VR simulation has enabled the training of soldiers with unparalleled levels of initial combat effectiveness in record amounts of time, with the average infantryman passing through combat training in a mere three days, and magical girls varying from one to two weeks, excluding preliminary \"test runs\".

## Relativity 

> By the early twenty‐second century, the world\'s major religions had become a shadow of their former selves, the victims of well over a century of declining religious participation among the world\'s populations. Strenuous efforts by multiple generations of religious leaders had slowed, but not stopped, the trend, and signs of decay were appearing everywhere, from the Vatican\'s strained finances to the shuttering of religious buildings worldwide. Only by appealing to cultural nostalgia and financial support could many such buildings expect to survive, as little more than tourist attractions. Despair began to creep into the tone of the world\'s clergy.
>
> Yet looming over this quiet apocalypse were the omens of something far direr, something that would upend their world just as surely it did the world as a whole...
>
> 〈*Abbreviated.*〉
>
> In the decades leading up to the Unification Wars, as the world\'s underclasses slipped deeper and deeper into destitution, and levels of want unseen for over a century began to re‐emerge, the world\'s religions found themselves unexpectedly recovering membership among the masses, particularly among those of the future Freedom Alliance FA) nations.
>
> Faced with this unexpected bonanza, a noticeable schism began to emerge among the religious factions. Some leaders and congregations, troubled by the naked economic injustice they saw around them, spoke out fiercely against it, organizing protests and challenging local governments. Other factions drifted in the direction of open apologism for the hyperclasses, lured by financial incentives, government support, and a mindset that discounted economic issues in favor of other issues. These factions preached acceptance of the world as it was, urging followers to seek salvation in the next life instead.
>
> The two sides competed heavily in the slums of the FA nations, as well as---much less prominently---in the subsidized tenements and skyscrapers of the United Front (UF) nations. Often, they found they had more in common with similar factions in other religions than with opposing factions of their own. As society itself fractured, so too did the world\'s religions.
>
> Under these conditions, both sides quickly radicalized, at least in the FA nations. The protest factions became increasingly militant and radical, suffering under the heavy weight of government oppression. The apologist factions became more and more closely intertwined with their government sponsors, even achieving state religion status in several of the FA nations.
>
> When events finally came to a head, with the atrocities of the more deranged FA hyperclasses shocking public and elite UF opinion, many of the apologist factions dissolved, their purpose served, their governments no longer interested in keeping the masses sedated. Others fused even more rigidly with the state, often becoming indistinguishable from the state itself.
>
> The protest factions, however, took a different route, most burrowing underground, and many turning into or merging with full‐fledged resistance and revolutionary movements, fighting what was now obvious evil. These drew on financial and material support from their UF members and increasing amounts of clandestine and, eventually, open support from UF governments.
>
> As the UF/FA cold wars turned increasingly hot, what remained of the world\'s religious organizations abandoned any semblance of neutrality, perhaps exemplified by the experience of the Catholic Church of the time. Conciliatory and diplomatic to almost the bitter end, the Church\'s conscience proved ultimately unable to abide the evil they saw around them, consequently drawing heavy pressure from FA governments. When the Vatican finally abandoned its traditional caution, the Pope issuing a scathing indictment of the FA nations, it found itself finally swept up in the wars wracking the newly‐disunified Eurozone. Ultimately, the Vatican was forced into exile, the pontiff himself airlifted out literally minutes ahead of arriving FA shock troops. After that, the Vatican‐in‐exile openly chose sides, exhorting its followers into holy war for the first time since the Crusades.
>
> Throughout the Unification Wars, religious factions proved an invaluable asset to the numerous resistance movements supported by the UF within FA nations, laying aside doctrinal differences to organize and defend the people.
>
> When victory finally arrived, the world\'s religions found themselves at a crossroads. In some regions, they were openly hated by the populace, who still associated them with their apologist variants. In others, their clergy were hailed as heroes for their wartime exploits. Despite the apparent chaos, however, religious leaders looked forward to the future, observing the dynamism of their fresh wartime converts, convinced they had finally redeemed themselves in the eyes of the people.
>
> Yet in the century that followed, while Humanity as a whole boomed and prospered, the world\'s religions once again stagnated. Energetic, unified wartime organizations lost focus without an enemy to fight, and endless internecine bickering and fractionation alienated and disgusted newer members, many of who had joined the organization as a whole, not this or that individual denomination.
>
> Governance, too, played a role, quietly wielding its levers of power to deliberately undermine religious belief as a whole, believing religion a threat to its radical biological and social engineering initiatives, and fearing the potential of religious conflict to weaken what it believed to be a fragile global unity. Religious organizations found their government support removed, their charitable institutions carefully replaced by secular equivalents, and countless bureaucratic obstacles strewn in their way. Meanwhile, generations of schoolchildren were constantly reminded that they had no obligation to follow their parents\' religion, and were taught by instructors indoctrinated in Governance ideology.
>
> By the mid‐twenty‐fourth century, then, mainstream religion found itself right back where it started. Their presence within the populace was minimal, their opinions had no weight on public or Governance opinion, and their memberships, relative to the population as a whole, were in seemingly terminal decline. The only consolation was that, with the advent of immortality, their core, most devoted membership looked likely to persist forever.
>
> #### --- Ishihara Tomoya, \"*A Brief History of Religion in the Post‐Modern and Future Age, Lessons from the Past,*\" introduction, excerpt. 

> Warfare on a heavily developed world is a nightmare of attrition. Innovations in Human siege doctrine and technology virtually assure it, with the stated goal of extracting maximal casualties for every planet taken.
>
> As long as a planet\'s production facilities and population remain intact, Cephalopod invaders are forced to contend with the full productive power of advanced Human manufacturing. Drones, materiel, and even starships can be deployed in seemingly endless quantities, as long as the factories are still intact to produce them. This ensures that, while in the short run alien fleets may bypass such a planet and press on, such a planet cannot be reduced at leisure, but must be reduced relatively soon, to prevent unacceptable risks to Cephalopod supply lines.
>
> On the surface, it may appear that planetary reduction is simply a matter of mass deployment of high‐yield weapons (HYW). In practice, such a deployment requires either orbital supremacy or surface access to the planet\'s urban centers. Since planetary production facilities are perfectly capable of deploying and launching a wide variety of orbital defenses and even starships, orbital supremacy on a developed world is nearly impossible to obtain unless a planet\'s urban centers are at least somewhat eliminated.
>
> Because of this, the cephalopods are forced into ground assaults. However, even the successful insertion of Cephalopod troops close enough to a city to deploy HYWs hardly ensures that a job is done; Human siege doctrine directs the construction of underground "redoubts\" on every planet in danger of being attacked, and many that are not in danger. Whenever a city comes within plausible range of attack or orbital bombardment, production facilities are then shifted underground as quickly as possible, ensuring that production facilities can only be eliminated with actual occupation of the city.
>
> This forces the cephalopods to send troops into the city itself---at this point usually only a pile of ruins aboveground---to contend with units and weaponry pouring out from below the surface, ready to defend every surviving structure, tunnel entrance, and piece of rubble.
>
> Then, finally, if the surface can no longer be contested, units withdraw into the underground redoubts. These deep bunkers are designed to be supremely defensible, with sealable ventilation systems, geothermal energy sources, carbon dioxide scrubbers modeled after asteroid bases, monitoring systems, protection against sappers, manufacturing facilities, and enough structural reinforcement to resist nuclear and antimatter detonations of tremendous magnitude.
>
> These are not impregnable, of course; nothing is. Technological advances ensure that redoubts are nearly impossible to starve out, but sooner or later alien sappers will breach the defenses enough to detonate a HYW in dangerous underground proximity. Most redoubts can withstand multiple such defensive failures, but by the time this stage has been reached, it is generally only a matter of time. Still, the alien troops tied up, the casualties extracted, and the time bought are all invaluable, and there have even been examples of colonial redoubts that held out long enough to be rescued when the world was retaken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Four years ago* 

Kishida Maki sighed dismally, head planted down on her work desk, directly into the pencil sketch she was working on. It was supposed to outline her plan for the next mural for her church, something that would at least serve as evidence of progress, but she had already given up on it. She felt no desire to complete it.

As it often did at these times, a shadow of a memory flitted across her mind, stinging all the more because of what it had once represented.

\"*You have so much talent! You should get some formal training and see where it takes you! I\'ve never seen a kid draw so well.*\"

That compliment, from her family minister, had helped set into motion her \"career\" in art, such as it was. Her family church, the church sub rosa,* had a large community of artists devoted to the production of art for members\' contemplations and admiration---one of the side effects of having a mostly unemployed society---and she had been funneled directly into it, because of her \"talent\".

The watercolor dispenser on her desk toggled its way through an array of colors, transitioning up and down the color wheel. She stared it, listlessly issuing the mental commands that kept it in motion. At her feet, a small cleaning drone picked up the crumpled remains of previous failed sketches, picking them up with an articulated arm, compressing them, and dumping them neatly into an attached basket.

She couldn\'t do it anymore. As a child, it had been easy to follow the expected religious themes and motifs without questioning. Anything to keep the flattery and praise coming.

But it wasn\'t enough for her, not anymore.

As she had grown older, she had tried to start drawing something outside the normal bounds, tired of the same repeated themes and images. Instead of the approbation she had expected, she had received disapproval and veiled warnings, confusing and troubling her. In the end, she had gone back and asked the same minister why the artists and mentors she had looked up to treated her so terribly, and refused to give her new work more than a cursory look.

The man had sighed, wiping the lenses of his ancient spectacles, and said:

*The members of our faith are old, and used to old things. They don\'t like new things. It\'s how we\'ve survived in this age, but it\'s also what\'s holding us back. You had to learn this someday, so that you could change it. That\'s why you caught my eye. I\'m counting on you to revive this tired old church.*

But she hadn\'t changed it. Her prestige had gone into sharp decline and the minister, her old mentor, had been summarily ejected from the church two years later.

*I tried, Maki‐chan,* the man had said, visiting her one last time in secrecy, away from the now‐hostile glares of her parents. *They wouldn\'t listen to me, so maybe you\'ll listen instead. This church is dead; I know that now. I said that a church must preach to the masses, that it is our Great Commission. We weren\'t afraid, once. We stood together with the people, and shielded them, and guided them, and uplifted them. This new war is our chance, but instead we while away our immortal lives in fearful isolation. I--I don\'t know. Live well, Maki‐chan. I must find my own way from now on.*

And then he had died, due to one of the few remaining civilian causes of death: demon attack.

It had taken her a long time to understand what he had meant.

Once, her church had been relevant. Once, its houses of worships had protected the people, and its ministers had stood in defiance against evil. But once the evil disappeared, they lost their way. In the face of a brave new world, with its immortal populace and quietly hostile Governance, they retreated, became uninterested in gaining new members or addressing anything about the world as it was. There was no attempt to maintain a presence in the colonies, and the advent of such radical things as magical girls, demons, and aliens drew little more than a shrug. They would be their own world, completely disconnected from anyone on the outside.

These were the things she learned, in the aftermath of his death, surfing the shoals of the internet alone, and talking to the schoolteachers that were more than glad to open the mind of an interested student. She found the kinds of answers that her church, almost smug in the news of her mentor\'s death, would not provide.

That was when her own faith had begun to slowly fade. The spectrum of Humanity was almost unimaginably wide, with myriad opinions, ways of living, and belief systems. She made new friends, outside the circle of her church, and under the now baleful eyes of her parents, began to realize just how much her own beliefs derived from nothing more than their influence, something darkly hinted at her by her instructors and Governance textbooks. Without their influence, what superiority did her beliefs have over those of anyone else?

She had begun quietly drawing new artwork, things that had nothing to do with her church, and posting it online anonymously. There she got praise and meaningful criticism, rather than useless icy ostracism.

She closed her eyes and stopped toying with her paint dispenser. She tried to remember what it had once been like, when she had really believed in all those stories about prophets parting oceans and curing diseases and making food out of nowhere.

She had looked far and wide, but as far as she could see, there was only one thing verifiably supernatural in the world, and that had nothing to do with clergy and everything to do with Incubators.

But...

As a child, when everything was new and every drawing was fresh, painting had been exciting, endlessly fun. When she could believe in what she was drawing, when the narrow field of paintings enjoyed by the community had still seemed wide enough to be worth exploring...

Well, it had been exhilarating.

A new religion, for a new age. One that was young and fresh, and could appreciate new forms of art. One with answers for this brave new world. One with truths that she could believe in.

That would be nice. But where was it?

*I\'m so tired...* she thought, letting the thought trail off.

*That can change, you know,* a voice thought into her head, clear and sharp. At that moment, it seemed almost clarion, nothing like the telephone calls she was used to. Clear, sharp, and resonant with her soul, in the way that should have answered the prayers she once said.

She opened her eyes.

Perched on the boxy white‐and‐red watercolor dispenser was a creature instantly recognizable to an entire generation of schoolgirls, trained to recognize an Incubator by sight and told almost nothing else.

*It seems you have potential,* the creature thought, its tail swinging back and forth. *Do you have a wish prepared?*

Maki sat up, peering at the Incubator in front of her for a long moment.

*The Incubators are demons,* her mother had once said. *If you ever see one, you should cast it out, and tell us immediately.*

\"Can I have some time to think about it?\" she asked, finally.

*I will not rush you,* the creature thought, *since your potential does not seem too unstable. I would advise you not to speak to your parents, though.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I wish to have something I can believe in again. I wish to have something I can paint wholeheartedly again.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Present Day, Present Time* 

\"I\'m surprised to see a girl like you out in a place like this.\"

Maki blinked in surprise, looking up from her sake, which she had been staring at in contemplation.

\"Mo--Sister Sakura!\" she said in surprise, staring up at the teenaged face of the Church Founder, shadowed by the dim and oscillating light of the dance club.

\"You almost called me Mother, didn\'t you?\" the girl asked rhetorically, sounding disappointed. \"I don\'t get why everyone insists on calling me that behind my back. Makes me feel old, even if I can\'t really deny the truth anymore. And please, don\'t call me sister out here.\"

Maki stared for a moment longer.

The other girl wasn\'t speaking particularly loudly, but she didn\'t have to, not with Maki\'s enhanced hearing. Otherwise, it might have been drowned out by the loud music in the background, which was some sort of neoclassical‐techno fusion. She had never been a fan, but the dancers seemed to like it.

She had spoken to Sakura‐san before, but always in passing, in greeting, or perhaps while in front of a church mural. Never extensively, or in a setting like this.

\"This seat taken?\" the other girl asked, and Maki shook her head vigorously no.

The girl sat down in the chair across from Maki and watched her seriously, as if to see what she would say. During the ensuing silence, a service drone delivered something exotic‐looking in front of the Church founder.

A margarita, her TacComp indicated, a moment later.

\"Why are you surprised to see me out here?\" Maki asked, finally, smiling awkwardly.

\"You\'re always cooped up in your room painting, except for demon hunts. And you know, you\'re a bit young. Not saying it\'s a bad thing---it\'s just why I\'m surprised.\"

Maki shrugged, a bit more elaborately than was necessary.

\"I used to go out occasionally before I contracted,\" she said. \"I thought I\'d try it again. No particular reason.\"

\"That\'s unusual, isn\'t it? You would have been a high‐schooler.\"

\"A little,\" she admitted. \"But not unheard of.\"

\"Strange to go out alone, isn\'t it?\" the girl asked, swirling her drink in its glass.

Maki almost answered immediately, but instead waited for the other girl as she downed the drink in one gulp.

\"Well, I haven\'t found much in the way of company since I moved to Mitakihara,\" Maki said.

\"How unfortunate. It\'s terribly lonely without company.\"

It was on the surface a perfectly normal statement, but something about the Church leader\'s voice sent a shiver up her spine. Something about the tone---

She suppressed a startled motion. She had remembered, suddenly, what exactly it was they said about Sakura Kyouko. Sakura‐san\'s dalliances were legendary; it was said that at one point in the past, she was taking home a different girl every night, occasionally more than one. Since then, she had cooled down, especially after founding the Church of Hope, but, the rumors said, she had never entirely stopped, something which set teeth gnashing among some of the more conservative elements of the Church. Among girls of a certain orientation, it was whispered that she could show you quite a good time, at least until she got tired of you. It was not wise to expect more.

Maki was indeed of a certain orientation, something she had discovered since she had fallen out with her parents. It was how she had heard the whispers.

Her breath quickened in her throat.

The Church founder sighed.

\"I definitely know about not having company,\" the girl said. \"October Three is coming up, and I\'ve worked myself to death in the preparations, but I\'ve got no one to share the stress with.\"

\"Sakura‐san---\"

\"Please, call me Kyouko.\"

\"Kyouko‐chan, this wasn\'t really a chance meeting, was it?\"

The girl watched Maki for a moment, before allowing her mouth to widen into a mischievous grin.

\"My reputation precedes me,\" Kyouko said, seeming amused.

The founder leaned forward, allowing her luxurious hair to fall in front of her shoulders. Maki grew suddenly aware that Saku---Kyouko\'s outfit, while not exactly revealing, wasn\'t exactly modest. She was close---very close---and Maki imagined that she could feel the other girl\'s breath.

\"Are you averse?\" Kyouko asked.

Maki swallowed nervously, trying to think of the right thing to say.

\"On the contrary, I\'m delighted,\" she managed, finally.

\"Hey,\" someone said, poking her in the cheek. Maki batted the arm away.

\"Go away,\" she murmured, annoyed that she had been interrupted just as she was about to get to the good part of the memory recording. \"I\'m still on break.\"

\"The team is going down to the canteen for food,\" Lieutenant Colonel Patricia von Rohr said, ignoring her complaints. \"I\'m not going to let you lounge around here. And I hear: Asaka has made time to come down too.\"

They didn\'t see the Brigadier General quite as much nowadays, a natural consequence of the fact that Asaka had more responsibilities to contend with than hanging around with two of her staffers, so her appearance was mildly notable.

She squinted at the unkempt‐looking Patricia. The light in the small room was provided by the softly glowing ceiling panels, which somehow contrived to make the other girl look particularly grungy. Maki doubted she herself looked any better. Freshening up was relatively low on the priority list.

She checked the time. It had passed midnight in Japan, which meant it was now October 1. Kyouko had never been big on anniversaries, but Maki wondered if she remembered, or still cared.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She still had yet to quite get used to living here, in this deep underground bunker, with its low ceiling and occasionally claustrophobic passages. Given the relatively fixed nature of urban warfare, both sides had plenty of time to dig in and, with the presence of cheap digger drones, that meant tunnels. Kilometer after kilometer of tunnels, bunkers, supply depots, and command posts. The Human tunnel network even had the additional virtue of connecting to the city\'s deep fortifications, an even deeper reinforced bunker system, hastily elaborated when it became clear that planetary landings were possible.

Their own situation was not so dire as to need the deep fortifications, thankfully. The planetary surface and space were both still heavily contested, including the city above their heads. There were plenty of buildings still standing, but unless one were actively involved in holding a position, it was advisable to withdraw to the tunnels whenever possible for better protection and significantly better amenities, and in case the squid decided to ignore their own troops in the city and throw a few antimatter devices anyway.

That meant that warfare for magical girls was, by and large, a matter of teams occasionally sticking their heads aboveground, helping to seize or defend a particularly important point on the battlefield, and then disappearing before they could be specially targeted. The hard work of staying above ground holding a ruined factory, or assaulting a position, room‐by‐room, was left to the infantry and their accompanying drones, who could better absorb the consequent casualties.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Not that I want to pry...\" Asaka began, as they sat down to a meal of synthesized rice and fish. Overall, the canteen was one of the nicer underground rooms, having been constructed long before the assault on the planet. It was brightly‐lit, had chairs and tables reminiscent of a fancy school cafeteria, and nice wall murals, including a giant tactical map of the city on one wall. Only the low ceiling served as a reminder that they were underground; vertical space was precious, due to the extensive cooling requirements of the deeper levels.

\"That inevitably means you\'re prying,\" Patricia commented, looking at the other girl from the corner of her eye.

\"Hush,\" Asaka reprimanded, waving her hand to shoo her. \"Okay, fine, I\'m prying. But I really want to know what went down between you and Kyouko. She seemed majorly angry you were leaving.\"

\"She doesn\'t want me risking my life out here,\" Maki said. \"We had a fight about it.\"

\"I don\'t think she\'s really the type to get that angry over something like that,\" Patricia said.

Maki shrugged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I won\'t let you risk your life out there!\" Kyouko shouted, face twisted and angry.

The girl started to angrily fling her arms, but stopped just in time, realizing that her room---more of a niche, really---was not large enough to safely do that in.

\"Do you have any idea how selfish you\'re sounding?\" Maki retorted. "There are millions out there fighting and dying, and you\'re saying I have to stay back because you want me to.\"

\"I don\'t care if I\'m being selfish!\" Kyouko fumed. \"I---Why do you even want to go anyway? I thought you were an artist!\"

\"I\'m going because I\'m an artist! I want something new to draw, and if I go now, I can deploy with Patricia and Asaka. It\'s an opportunity!\"

\"What kind of reason is that?\"

\"The only thing that matters to me!\" Maki said, starting to get truly angry. \"What is it with you? My art is what I care about, and you can\'t even pretend to give a damn! In fact, I think you\'re trying not to!\"

Kyouko started to say something, then stopped, stymied by the unexpected truth of that.

\"Why do you work so hard to stay detached?\" Maki asked. \"Why is it so hard for you to show interest? I\'ve tried showing you my art, I\'ve tried talking to you, and you blow me off every time.\"

She clenched her eyes briefly, surprised by unexpected tears.

\"It hurts, you know?\" she said. \"I promised myself I wouldn\'t get attached to you, because everyone says you\'re going to get tired of me, but it\'s been nearly a year now. This is the longest you\'ve ever stayed with anybody. It\'s a damn farce! Is it really that important to you not to---\"

She took a breath to steady herself.

\"When this Church first granted me a combat exemption, they told me it was because of my talent, that you personally requested it. I thought you meant my art. But no, I realize what it is now. I\'m nothing but a toy to you. Do you know you say her name?\"

Kyouko blanched, perhaps the first time Maki had ever seen her discomfited by something Maki said.

\"Wh---Who?\" Kyouko asked, a second too late.

\"You know who. Sayaka. Miki Sayaka. You\'ve let her name slip out a couple of times. I\'ve seen that old picture you carry around. I\'ve seen what she looks like. She\'s almost my twin. Is that really it? I know there\'s something eating at you, but is this really it? You\'ve pined for a girl for four hundred years, so you seduce the first one you see who looks like her? Grant her an exception to military service for her \"talent\" without even looking at any of her work? I really am just a body to you, aren\'t I?\"

She stopped, breathing heavily, as Kyouko looked back, wide‐eyed, the seconds ticking by on the ancient analog clock on the desk.

\"Goddess, you really are just like her,\" Kyouko said, finally. "You\'re not going to listen to me, you\'re going to get yourself killed---\"

\"Shut up!\" Maki said. \"You listen to me! I\'m not going to stand around here being your--your... Not anymore! That\'s why I\'m leaving. Because I don\'t want to know that I\'m sitting around here while others are dying, because you took a fancy to my body. But I\'m still willing to stay. I\'ll stay and keep painting for the Church, if you promise me you\'ll tell me what this Sayaka was to you, and stop treating me like--like some sort of embarrassment.\"

Kyouko stared back at her, and Maki could see, unexpectedly, that the girl was on the verge of crying.

Maki opened her mouth to say something---

\"Fine,\" Kyouko said, voice quiet and empty, turning abruptly away from her. \"You can go. This is over.\"

\"What?\" Maki asked. \"Look---\"

\"You said you\'d leave, so do it! Get out of here! I don\'t need your face tormenting me anymore.\"

\"But---\"

\"I said *get the fuck out!*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They surfaced inside a now‐abandoned factory, one of the heavily‐defended strongpoints that anchored this part of the line. They had no teleporter with them to transport them around covertly, but they did have a stealth generator, and it was under her auspices that they exited the building, after having spent a moment to chat with the building\'s garrisoned infantry. The squid knew, of course, that this building contained one of the tunnel entrances, and were fond of plastering the area with missiles and shells if they spotted someone important leaving. The building\'s point defenses would probably take care of it---that was how it was still standing, after all---but no reason to tempt fate.

The objective was simple. There was a well‐defended alien strongpoint in the vicinity, in the still‐standing ruins of a particularly tall residential tower. It served as a nest for a large number of extreme‐range snipers and a substantial number of relatively heavy weapons, and also provided an excellent vantage point of this area of the city. Their job was to retake the building, allow the infantry to garrison, and then leave.

They traversed the intervening distance at moderate speed, maintaining transmission silence, though of course they could just use telepathy. To reduce the possibility of being spotted because of any objects they might kick aside accidentally, they scattered and took slightly separate routes, opting to jump off the sides of buildings rather than running along the ground, still remaining barely within the stealth generator\'s field of effectiveness. It was a less predictable and less easily noticed route, and the Human infantry manning the buildings were informed to temporarily not fire on anything they might notice.

It was not that the stealth would fail to conceal something as obvious as a pebble being kicked across the ground; it was that the pebble would appear to spontaneously shift position after the stealth passed by. The rain was a theoretical concern, too, but thus far the aliens had not evinced the ability to notice magical girls based on infinitesimal changes in how wet the ground was.

Human buildings were built fairly resiliently nowadays, so that unless a particularly powerful weapon such as an alien particle cannon were fired at an area, the majority of buildings away from the epicenter of a major detonation tended to have at least an intact superstructure. Thus, the landscape they traversed, while flattened in some areas, still had a large variety of standing buildings, ghostly, shattered, and generally ruined, the masonry torn off and contributing to the substantial amount of rubble in the streets below. The planet wasn\'t dense enough to warrant core world style traffic tubes and endless skyscrapers, so the buildings themselves were reasonably short and separated.

The productive capacity of the city of Heliopolis was mostly in tunnels below it now, and the civilian population, except for necessary manufacturing workers, had had time to evacuate, so in a war‐making sense the fact that the city was a gray, shattered husk was not too significant. In a human sense, though, she had to feel sorry for those whose homes and lives had once been here.

It seemed entirely appropriate to Maki that it happened to be raining lightly, giving the mid‐afternoon scene even more of a grim pallor.

They arrived at the boundary of no man\'s land, peering up at the tower they would be seizing. Around and behind them, the local infantry companies had already gathered. The infantry knew that they were there, but were unable to see or otherwise register their presence.

They waited for the signal.

Then, the infantry and drones around them stormed forward, pouring out of the buildings and rubble, under a sudden barrage of covering fire, artillery bombardment, and missiles. They reached new firing positions if they could, but despite the drones trying to block damage and the optimal trajectories they attempted to take, many fell on the way under a storm of both invisible and tracered laser fire, which blinked on and off rapidly, striving to expend valuable energy only on actual targets. Their own support fire strove to keep the aliens suppressed, and carefully timed cruise missiles screamed inward, most intercepted out of the sky. Their tactical air support dove in from the sky, releasing their payloads.

The beginning stages of the attack were designed to look just like all the ones that had preceded it, which had failed ignominiously. Besides providing a distraction, it helped indicate where alien weaponry was concentrated, and which fields of fire would be necessary to avoid.

Then they moved out, as quickly as they could, vaulting over most of the battle on the ground. They had to be judicious about obvious magic use; otherwise, it\'d tip the alien defenders off. They would wait until they got close to drop the stealth.

They took up positions on the buildings surrounding the tower, standing on rooftops and within crumbled window frames. They eyed attack points: laser battery and sniper positions, open windows large enough to jump directly into, staircases and other locations where it might be possible to quickly ascend the building. They coordinated by telepathy, trying to convey mental images as best they could when imagery was needed---still not a refined art for most girls.

*Ready?* Patricia thought, somewhere on the other side of the building.

They assented.

*Then stealth drop in five---on mark,* Patricia thought, knowing they could all be relied upon to know exactly when five seconds was, based on internal chronometers.

Maki watched the time, then, just before the five seconds were up, launched herself off of the rooftop she was standing on, vaulting the distance between buildings.

Without looking, she knew that Patricia would have seized control of as many of the local alien drones as possible, while someone else would be releasing a substantial quantity of their own. Near her, a staccato of well‐placed magical bolts disabled alien personnel in the nearby windows.

Maki paid it only partial attention, focusing instead on her own actions. In the nearly insensible duration of time it took her to cross the gap, she summoned a set of her signature apparitions---ghost missiles, other magical girls, or even just giant black sheets---at various locations around the building to draw fire or block vision.

She dove into the window opening, just as the stealth protecting her disappeared, swords already in hand, crossed in front of her.

She knew what she would find: the inhabitants of the room firing desperately at an illusion of a magical girl charging at them through a doorway inside the building, and therefore not facing in her direction.

There was no time to think about it. The movement of her dive carried one of her swords straight through one of the infantry still covering the window. She spun, dodging the volume of shrapnel automatically ejected from the alien\'s suit, a common design feature now that being killed by melee was a frequent issue.

It almost felt like a dance, the way she turned the spin into the momentum necessary to cut another of the aliens in half, then thrust forward, impaling the remaining two before dodging away from the shrapnel again. Sparks flew from her blades as they sliced through forcefields, and high‐velocity shrapnel dented the walls behind her. Too‐late laser fire impacted the walls, illuminating her as she moved---steel‐blue breastplate, metal gauntlets and boots, short hair, no hairpins.

Then she spun one last time, slicing one more time through the aliens she had impaled before they even began to fall.

All of that before any of them had any chance to respond, but she stayed alert, taking the time to make sure that each alien---and each suit---was truly incapacitated. A long time ago, before Kyouko had pulled her out of the ranks, she had almost been killed by one of the suits trying to exact revenge, regardless of whether the alien inside it was already dead or not.

During that brief period of examination, she might have been in risk from the building itself---from booby traps, for instance, or a floor of the building primed to self‐destruct---but she didn\'t have to worry about that.

*Secured,* someone behind her thought.

She turned to look at the other girl, who had followed her in and currently had her hand on the wall, keeping her eyes closed as if she were communing with the wall---which wasn\'t actually a bad description of what she was doing.

*It\'s a fairly large building,* Maki thought. *You sure?*

*Well,* the girl thought. *I have enough enchantment on this building to have the traps and some of the defense equipment disabled, at least. I only have complete control of around five floors, though.*

The girl smiled, the expression vaguely predatory among the mass of tangled, curly hair.

*They never expect the walls to try to kill them.*

Maki checked the information that was scrolling into their information systems, now that there was less need for transmission discipline. The hallways in front of her had been cleared, according to the girl next to her, so she had no need to go out and check or clean up. The infantry were already moving through the lower floors to occupy the building, now that the crippling firepower from before was mostly neutralized. The entrance into the squid tunnel network had already been sealed. Engineering and counter‐sapping details would move in to prevent any possible attempts to collapse the building from below. The top had significant anti‐missile and point defenses, but they were mostly irrelevant for defending against an infantry assault.

*We should help clear the top of the building, and do it quickly, Patricia thought from somewhere. *One of them might have explosives and try to self‐destruct. But for safety, most of us should go back.*

A list of the ones that were staying followed, including Patricia herself, Maki, the stealth generator, and a few others, including the enchanter. Maki nodded to herself. It made sense.

*Just another day.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it was all over, she took a moment to look out one of the windows near the top, watching the exhaust trails of fighter aircraft elsewhere in the ruined city and listening to the thunderous rumble of distant shells landing.

*If you\'re listening, I hope all of this is for a good reason,* she prayed silently. *And if you\'ll forgive a selfish question, I wonder if you, in your human life, ever had to deal with---well, were you and Homura---no, I\'m being silly.*

She turned to join the others in leaving. She certainly had something to believe in now, but it would be nice if, once in a while, the divine would actually answer her.

Maybe she could try the Ribbon again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"So I really want to know: What kind of name is *Acheron* anyway?\"

Ryouko and Asami glanced at each other, then at the girl sitting across from them, looking back with such earnest eyes. Meiqing sported an unusual hairstyle, one of those asymmetric ponytails that were vaguely in style, which she kept in front of her right shoulder.

\"Well?\" the girl demanded, raising and clenching a fist in a gesture of demand. It made her look less, rather than more, serious.

\"Sounds like a fine name to me,\" Asami said, sounding slightly bored. "Vaguely Greco‐Roman. Governance loves names like that.\"

\"The river of pain,\" Ryouko said, reciting the information off of an internal reference, her eyes unfocusing. \"One of the seven rivers of Hades, it is known primarily for being the river across which Charon ferries the souls of the dead. In Dante\'s *Inferno*---\"

\"Yeah, yeah, see?\" Meiqing interrupted, addressing Asami. \"Hades. Hell. Why would you name a planet after that?\"

Acheron was, of course, the minor colony world they were being sent to garrison.

\"Maybe it just sounds cool,\" Asami shrugged. \"Besides, it\'s not like the Greeks thought of Hades in the same way Christians think of hell. And doesn\'t this planet have vol---\"

\"Susana, what do you think?\" Meiqing asked. \"Susana!\"

She shoved the girl next to her, who opened her eyes and looked at the others, briefly confused, before her TacComp played back the audio recording of the conversation.

\"I think it\'s a fine name,\" she said blearily. \"Sounds nice. Not like anyone does much dying nowadays anyway.\"

\"But we do dying,\" Ryouko felt obliged to point out quietly, complete with botched grammar.

\"We\'re almost at the arch‐boss,\" Susana said, obviously not quite paying attention, curly blonde hair settling over her face. \"So I\'m a bit distracted right now. The low transmission throughput is annoying. On the other hand, if I can talk you guys into finally joining, we\'ll be glad to power‐train you.\"

They demurred, and the girl closed her eyes, going back into whatever VR game she was talking about.

\"So my point is, it\'s just not an auspicious name,\" Meiqing finished.

Ryouko shrugged, and took a moment to look around her. Their subsection of the training cohort was traveling to their destination via transport ship, and frankly the multi‐day trip was somewhat boring. They took unnecessary long naps in their individual cabins, chatted up crew members and other passengers, used the rec rooms, and explored the ship, but it turned out that three days could feel like a surprisingly long time to be cooped onto even a large ship, especially with very little need for sleep. The whole thing served as a dull contrast to their previous onslaught of simulations, which presented them with planet after planet and combat situation after combat situation.

So at the moment they were half‐heartedly sitting around one of the ship\'s lounges, swilling non‐alcoholic drinks and chatting desultorily in the red plush couches, having been unable to agree on which recreational pastime they wanted to do next. Sure, there were things to read, or holographic board games to play, or VR things to do, but... it just didn\'t feel exciting anymore. Not to her.

At the moment, she, Asami, and Meiqing were practically the only ones there, though Susana and the other four in the game were doing something together as a... clan? Was that what they called it? In any case, they hardly counted as conversational partners, so it was really just Ryouko and the other two, as well as the fully‐functional bar robot---no one had been intrepid enough to ask alcohol of it yet.

Ryouko had spent quite a deal of time staring out at the stars on the way to their training planet, but had eventually finally tired of staring out the false window at the electronically regenerated starfield. So it was here as well, though at the moment she found her eyes being drawn out the window again. The refiltered starfield looked the same as it had the whole trip, but she couldn\'t shake the urge---

A sharp green light at the edge of her vision interrupted her thoughts, and she looked at it in immediate surprise, intuiting the source.

\"What was that?\" Meiqing asked.

Her soul gem ring had been glowing softly the whole trip, and they had mostly learned to ignore it, but this had been different---a sudden, unexpected, piercingly‐bright flash.

\"I don\'t know,\" she said, quite honestly. \"I\'m not sure why it glows in the first place, and now this flashing---\"

The gem flashed again, just as brightly, casting the area in a harsh, green glow.

\"Hmm? Is something going on?\" Susana asked, green eyes opening again, probably alerted to the situation by her TacComp.

Asami stared at the gem for a moment, then closed her eyes. Ryouko knew the look by now, having seen it in simulations as she searched in the distance for alien hover‐troopers.

\"Laplace,\" Asami asked out loud, addressing the ship. \"Are we scheduled to rendezvous with anyone sometime soon?\"

\"No,\" the pleasant sounding ship\'s voice replied, a hologram of the white‐haired mathematician appearing in front of them, hands clasped behind his back. \"We will not be meeting any other ships until we approach Acheron.\"

Ryouko\'s gem flashed multiple times in sudden sequence as Asami said:

\"Are you sure? I sense something in the distance, but it doesn\'t feel like FTL engines. It\'s very faint, though.\"

There was a pause, while the hologram visibly dipped his head in thought.

\"Noted,\" the ship said, in a slight affected French accent, tugging nervously at his collar, eyelids fluttering over his mismatched eyes: one normal, one tattooed \"I/O\" in the AI style.

\"I will pay closer attention and signal the convoy defenses,\" he continued. \"The aliens very rarely raid this deep in Human space, however. There is nothing on my sensors, nor are there any known astronomical anomalies in the area.\"

\"Okay,\" Asami said, looking worried.

\"That seems at least a little concerning,\" Meiqing commented. \"You really have no idea what it is?\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Asami said, closing her eyes again. \"I don\'t like it.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was only about half an hour later that Asami, whose increasingly troubled demeanor had weighed down on their conversational milieu, opened her eyes one more time and said quietly:

\"I\'m certain now. There are ships approaching. I don\'t have enough experience to know everything for certain, but they\'re moving much faster than any of the ships we passed near New Athens. Laplace says nothing in the Human fleet travels so quickly.\"

Ryouko and Meiqing stared at her in shock. They had expected something of the sort, but for the past half‐hour Asami and Laplace had sat in deathly quiet, leaking no hint of their internal conversations.

The eyes of the game‐engrossed mages around them snapped open, some of them jerking slightly with the remnants of their last in‐game action, as they were force‐quit from their simulation, in response to the ship\'s declaration of battle stations.

\"I can\'t believe it\'s really true,\" Ngo Thi An said, a moment later. "Susana told us something was going on, but---this is supposed to be a safe convoy route! It\'s far out of range of standard alien raids. Why us?\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Laplace said, clasping his hands in front of him, his period costume suddenly seeming garishly out of place. \"It could be a test‐run for new tactics, or something like that. Fortunately, we have plenty of warning, since they\'re not even on my sensors yet. I\'ve called for help, the crew has been alerted, and I\'ve placed my engines into emergency acceleration. With this degree of advance warning, my---our---chances are much better than they would be otherwise.

\"Pierre,\" Ryouko asked. \"Just what are our chances? The eight of us are here---\"

\"I know,\" the ship interrupted, glancing at her. \"But you\'re untrained for this kind of combat. I know you\'ve had vacuum training, but space combat can easily get overwhelming for new girls like you. That\'s why that training is separate.\"

Laplace placed a hand on his balding head---the ship had chosen to imitate an older period of the Frenchman\'s life.

\"I\'m not defenseless,\" he said, \"And our chances are better than you might think. Consult your TacComps. Let\'s see what I can do, okay?\"

The ship looked around at the others. When they said nothing further, he said:

\"There\'s a reinforced passenger compartment near the cargo area. There will be emergency spacesuits and external access ports nearby. Wait there. Hopefully, it won\'t be necessary.\"

Then he vanished.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gravitational distortions appeared on his sensors a few minutes later.

His readings matched, as he expected, the characteristics of the Cephalopod long‐range fighter class, the only class of vessel that would show up at such distances and in such low numbers, with the general goal of raiding shipping and commerce, while their bomber brethren targeted vulnerable facilities and planets. They had never been recorded to attack this deep in Human space, but there was a first time for everything, he supposed.

If *HSS Pierre‐Simon Laplace* had had features with which to express it, he would have smiled grimly. As it was, he had to imagine the smile to himself. On other occasions he might have toggled some of his internal displays amusedly, but many of those were powered down now, every last joule diverted out of non‐essential functions.

There was a reason he was referred to as a \"convoy\", despite consisting of only one crewed transport ship. Sure, he wasn\'t accompanied by frigates or cruisers, but he was hardly without protection. Smaller droneships swarmed around him, ranging from relatively large FTL‐engined gun platforms, to smaller attack and defense drones---and even further down to tiny motes of smartdust, designed to mitigate laser intensity and confuse sensors. The smaller drones rode in the FTL‐bubble formed by the larger ships.

In these drones lay his primary hope of survival. To fulfill their functions as long‐distance raiders, alien fighters were extremely light, lighter even than the ubiquitous frigates, and carried very little in the way of drone complements. With their forcefield shielding and extreme acceleration abilities, they were still difficult to destroy despite their relative flimsiness, but it meant his drones and weapons would not face interference, and would be essentially free to operate up until the point they were directly destroyed by enemy weapons fire.

And if that didn\'t work, he had a forcefield generator of his own, unusual for a ship of his relatively small size. That came courtesy of his specialty in ferrying valuable cargo.

He had asserted earlier that, since he had warning, they had relatively good chances. He had meant it. These kinds of raids relied heavily on the element of surprise, the fighters using their paradox drives to blink in somewhere undetected, then racing up to their target at the kind of FTL speeds that only they were capable of. In the moment their FTL shells merged with the target\'s, they would release weapons, traveling at nearly the speed of light relative to their target, where they could literally drop rocks out the window and still be extremely dangerous.

This first pass was the most dangerous, and often annihilated their unprepared targets. Usually, given the extreme speed of the fighters, there would not be time between sensor detection and weapons deployment for the target to mount an effective response; the odds were generally not good.

If finishing‐off was needed, they would fly back to do it, a process that often took substantial lengths of time, given the fighters\' tendency to substantially overshoot the target on the first pass. If the target looked mostly intact, the second pass usually never happened; an evading target, even a cargo ship, was difficult to target at high relativistic speeds, and it was often necessary to pull up alongside at low relative speeds, which risked fighter loss.

That was where their chances lay.

He kept his metaphorical eyes fixed on the rapidly approaching ships. His chances were better than might otherwise be expected, but he didn\'t want to get valuable mages killed just because he fudged a calculation---especially since it would impact the career of his mental backup when it was activated to replace him. There wouldn\'t be time for him to observe the weapons drop and respond; he had to predict it, and preempt it at precisely the right moment.

Laplace had been doing this a long time, and had survived his share of similar scrapes; the captain and other crew accepted his suggested plan in its entirety, without suggesting amendments. They\'d be useful in other stages of the fight---if there were other stages---but these early stages, with their high‐precision, high‐speed maneuvering, was all on him. The pilot was responsible for navigation, not combat maneuvering, after all.

He cruised in his cloud of escort drones, giving no sign that he had been given warning, even showing a few signs of the kind of panic that\'d be expected of a vessel that spotted unexpected adversaries, hastily shifting drones around in an attempt at defense and gunning his engine in a seeming attempt to outrun the fighters. Unseen, he stored thruster power instead, not really using his full speed.

The ship watched the milliseconds tick by, as the other ships came inexorably closer. As he usually did, he spared a moment of thought for his girlfriend, the cruiser *HSS Jeanne d\'Arc,* who he always thought had a rather aesthetically designed hull. He also took a moment to think about *HSS Flavius Aetius,* though they hadn\'t spoken to each other in, what, a year now?

Then he disregarded his emotional subroutines and returned to the task at hand. He waited.

And waited.

Then the fighters finally achieved a barely subluminal relative speed, enabling an FTL shell merger. At that exact moment, they released their relativistic payloads, as they passed perpendicular to Laplace\'s trajectory. Also at that exact moment, Laplace accelerated hard towards its relative zenith with fully charged engines. Defense drones poured into the space now vacated, prepared to deflect, detonate, or otherwise eliminate whatever weapons had been launched, which turned out to be an incredible seven Ravager‐class anti‐ship missiles---raiders rarely expended more than three on a single ship, and each fighter only carried one.

Stymied by the unexpectedly rapid shift in trajectory of their target, the missiles attempted course correction, but had essentially no time to do so at their speed, especially with interference from the drones. Three suffered immediate guidance failures, confused by interference thrown their way by the drones, and flew off onto pointless trajectories, completing their detonation cycles in futile locations---because of the duration of engagement, the missiles had to begin detonating literally as they were being fired. Another one was lanced by a drone laser midflight, its rapid, immense explosion completing only after the explosion itself had already left the original FTL shell, keeping the near‐lightspeed velocity of the original missile. Relativistic effects applied: time appeared to pass slowly on board the missiles as observed from Laplace, and their explosions were compressed into turbulent discs from Lorentz contraction.

Another two missiles barely missed, and instead rammed his thruster exhaust---which was naturally being vectored downward to propel him up---and were torn apart. An expanding cloud of hot gas was generally harmless, except when rammed at near‐lightspeed. The missiles were much too flimsy to survive that. It was a trick he had learned from *HSS Jeanne d\'Arc* back in the day.

The last one came hair‐raisingly close, finally intercepted by the sacrifice of a drone gun platform at nearly the last moment.

Then came his turn, as the streaking fighters, moving too fast to significantly adjust their original courses, ran into a field of suddenly deployed drone mines, accompanied by a crisscross of laser fire from his lower gunners. His laser cannons were woefully underpowered, but at this kind of range they were difficult to dodge, even with FTL sensors. Human gunners chose and extemporized general firing strategy, while his own subroutines corrected for the natural error humans made targeting at relativistic speeds and decided exact timing. It was as efficient a division of labor, processing‐wise, as was possible.

The fighters, at the extreme speed they were traveling, could not respond, and their forcefields lit up with a brilliant staccato of mine explosions and laser impacts. Of the seven, only six managed to survive to streak out the other side, less than a millisecond later, with one of those six substantially damaged.

He allowed himself a moment of satisfaction as the fighters overshot, surging far into the distance. Then he wondered why a fighter squadron on a deep raid would waste seven expensive missiles on one transport ship. Still, now that they had utterly failed, it was likely they would withdraw, and his crew was already exchanging congrat---

No, wait, were they coming back?

Why would they come back?

If the ship had had teeth, it would have gritted them, as it braced for extended combat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Tch,*\" Meiqing vocalized, observing the latest developments on her internal interface. \"I thought it was over.\"

Ryouko rubbed her shoulders where the straps of her seat had dug in when g‐forces overwhelmed the ship\'s gravity stabilizers.

\"Laplace, what are our chances now?\" she asked.

\"My apologies,\" the ship\'s voice responded instantly from the intercom, perfectly pleasant. \"My computational resources are currently in emergency allocation mode. I will not answer low‐priority queries.\"

It was not a particularly reassuring response, and a slight murmur passed through the assembled passengers: the eight magical girls strapped to seats attached to one wall, and the assorted Governance officials, military officers, and two civilian traders strapped to the others, all wearing magnetic boots.

Unlike the others, the eight of them had been allocated a low‐bandwidth connection with the ship\'s current situation, which they followed avidly on their internal monitors. Though not directly in the ship\'s chain of command, they were temporarily under the command of the ship\'s captain, and of the ship itself---considered equivalent in command authority.

That was what the regulations stipulated, anyway, according to their TacComps. Thus far, however, they hadn\'t been asked to do anything but sit tight. In the back of their minds, though, their TacComps were doing their best to implant a last‐minute burst of emergency tactical knowledge. Little could be done in so short a time, except to thrust into memory a few hasty short‐term templates of space combat knowhow, templates that would quickly fade, but the attempt had to be made.

Ryouko gave Asami\'s hand a reassuring squeeze, since the girl seemed extremely tense, her eyes darting to and fro, back and forth, as if trying to follow something she couldn\'t see---which was probably exactly what she was doing.

Then Ryouko focused on the information they were being given. It really wasn\'t that detailed; just a vague spatial diagram of where enemies and larger drones were relative to the ship, along with damage estimates. The diagram swirled dizzyingly as all the participants, including the ship itself, maneuvered and spun through space, the group as a whole still moving toward distant Acheron at high‐FTL speeds.

She requested field command mode, and her visualization slowed down dramatically, so that she could discern the to‐and‐fro of weapon launches, if only barely.

*It\'s so fast!* she commented to their group. *How on Earth do magical girls keep up?*

*In truth, no one is sure,* Clarisse surprised her by responding. *Your reaction and attack speeds are nearly preternatural. The kind of instincts that MGs have---there is a lot of suspicion that they contain elements of precognition, but this has never been proven.*

*But if we\'re traveling FTL, and there are FTL weapons and sensors, doesn\'t that already include elements of reverse causation, in a relativistic sense?* Susana interjected. *What does precognition even mean in this context?*

She seemed unfazed by what sounded like Ryouko responding to herself, or what was, on closer inspection, a very unusual TacComp.

*That is a very good question,* Clarisse thought. *The answer to that is unknown, since precognition is not a well‐studied topic. Now is not---*

She was interrupted by spontaneous cheering as one of the fighters, the most damaged, disappeared from the screen, detonating under a barrage of gunfire from the ship\'s aft guns. Compared to the alien fighters, their transport might as well as been a sitting tortoise---but a tortoise in its shell was hard to crack for fighters designed for deep space raiding instead of sustained exchanges of fire.

Ryouko watched the situation quietly, even as Clarisse continued to regale the others with informative dialogue. The alien fighters were taking damage, but not fast enough, not by her eye. The transport was losing drones too quickly. Soon, weapons fire would start making it through to the ship itself.

*As I was saying, now is not the time to discuss this,* Clarisse said. The relevant equations for this kind of combat take a while to learn, and it is at any rate too rapid for you to do them in your head. It seems, though, that magical girls have an excellent instinctive grasp of pseudo‐relativistic combat, which some ascribe to the Incubators, though they have never confirmed nor denied this.*

There was brief pause, in an interim of time that was almost imperceptible to the outside world.

*In any case,* Clarisse thought, *as some of you have already realized, the situation is growing dire. Your TacComps will fill you in.*

Before Ryouko could ask, the knowledge appeared in her mind: their TacComps had taken the opportunity to network and, as the most computationally proficient, Clarisse had naturally taken the lead.

*What do we do?* one of the girls asked.

*We have to help,* Ryouko thought, having already reasoned it through. Now that it\'s come to this, the longer we wait, the worse the situation. Laplace!*

There was no response.

*Laplace! Captain Makuza!*

〈*Brace for impact*,〉 Laplace thought, nearly devoid of affect.

The detonation, when it came, was surreal in its seeming languor. First came a rumble that seemed almost gentle, from her time‐slowed perspective. The right edge of the metal ceiling above buckled inward, just barely slow enough for her to perceive---

And then it shattered, briefly expelling shards of metal before reversing, turning concave instead of convex. A sudden rush of air through the new two‐meter‐wide hole testified to the fact that their compartment was now open to vacuum.

She clung to the seat straps that kept the torrent from drawing her upward, and the ship lurched. Screams sounded around her, until muted by the loss of air, or just as likely, Emergency Safety Packages.

*Lung and sinus pressures safely equalized,* Clarisse thought. *Damage minimal. Drawing on emergency oxygen reserves. Vacuum survival mechanisms activated.*

A man on the other side of the room, one of the assigned crew members, unbuckled himself and advanced, gesturing for calm.

\"*Someone will be here to repair the damage soon,*\" he transmitted. "*Remain calm. We will evacuate if necessary.*\"

Compartments in the walls, floor, and remaining parts of the ceiling opened, and legged drones crawled out, adhering magnetically to the various surfaces, breathing apparatuses in tow.

Ryouko looked up at the hole above her head, which appeared to extend through two other cargo compartments of the ship before finally reaching the vacuum of space, while Clarisse informed her that the reason it was only a hole was almost certainly forcefield mitigation of the weapon impact. Incidentally, forcefield energy stores were now down to 60%.

She took a moment to check that, yes, forcefields were unidirectional. It would be quite unhelpful to have a forcefield that funneled internal explosions back inward. Unfortunately, this meant the main forcefield was also unhelpful to prevent atmosphere from escaping.

She ran through her reasoning one last time, to make sure her logic was sound. As far as she could tell, it was, and Clarisse raised no objections.

*We have to go!* Ryouko asserted, releasing her straps and standing up. We have no choice!*

She advanced towards the crew member, without looking back at the others. Thus far she had been the most assertive about needing to help, believing it justified by the exigencies of the situation, but now that she was here, a large part of her felt a singular reluctance to actually do it.* She couldn\'t look back, lest skeptical or fearful looks from the others weaken her resolve or, just as bad, introduce dissension. Better for everyone that she appear gung‐ho.

Artificial gravity was still in place, she was glad to see.

She dismissed her field command mode.

\"*Your spacesuits; where are they?*\" she transmitted, now back in normal time.

The crewman, a junior lieutenant, pointed at various lockers scattered around the room.

\"*You mean to go out?*\" he transmitted.

She nodded, then looked back at the other girls, who were in various stages of standing themselves up, one by one. There was, she was glad to see, no sign of dissent, no one holding out from fear or tactical disagreement. That was reassuring.

All she knew about space combat---the mind‐blowing speed, the vast amounts of radiation being flung about, and the strange and alien physics that came into play---combined to create a terrified feeling in the pit of her stomach, which she hoped to confine to just her stomach.

But if there was anything the endless train of simulations had taught them, it was about how to shove those thoughts away, until it was a direct matter of life and death, so that one could ride on combat instinct alone, and there was no safe place to balk and return to.

*Pierre, support us if you can,* she thought.

The ship didn\'t respond, and this time she didn\'t know if it was because it wouldn\'t, or that it couldn\'t.

But then the lockers snapped open on their own, and racks of spacesuits sped outward, and somehow avoided striking any of the girls standing. A large compartment in the rear of the room slid out, revealing an assortment of weapons Ryouko wouldn\'t have guessed were there: heavy laser cannon, contact explosives, missile launchers...

She blinked.

*Thanks,* she thought.

There were no grief cubes, but there was no more time left. They\'d have to go with what they carried on their persons.

She reached for a suit---

*Transform first,* Clarisse reminded.

Right.

Earlier, transforming in front of so many people might have bothered her, but the simulations had taught her that very few people in a combat zone cared about how frilly her costume was.

There were a few moments of hasty equipment gathering, the others following her example by enchanting the suits to merge with their own costumes. Here in space, the suits provided useful direct protection---from the vacuum, radiation, and micrometeorites---as well as providing propulsion and a few other capabilities. In her mind, Ryouko stitched together pieces of a rudimentary plan, skimmed heavily from suggestions from Clarisse. Nothing fancy, just basic principles: deploy quickly, move quickly, stay moving. Keep on guard, and watch every major combatant, friendly or enemy. Basic principles, easy to forget. She disseminated it, and no one argued---of course, there was hardly anything worth arguing about.

Then, when they were done, they stood under the hole, looking up at the shattered, unfiltered starfield of an FTL shell, before the wide eyes of the other passengers, and those of the damage control crewman with his drones, who was waiting for them to leave so he could patch the hole.

Ryouko looked around her, seeing the world through a fiber‐optic‐laced helmet panel, one designed to transmit much of the EM spectrum. Direct perception was precious to a magical girl, something the designers had apparently considered, if one compared the space suit helmet with the impassive panel‐less infantry helmets.

On the other hand, she had enchanted the suit, so who knew how the panels really operated anymore?

No one seemed to be moving.

*Well, here goes, I guess,* she thought.

She took a breath, and vaulted upward with a sure power that seemed quite at odds with her customary build and appearance. The internal features of the ship flashed by, and then she found herself staring at the endless depth of space. Instead of the carefully reconstructed starfield she had seen all this time from inside the ship, she now saw the raw light that poured into the FTL shell, a tortured misshaped smear that failed to resemble the normal night sky in any way. The radiation would have been tremendous, she knew, were it not for arduously careful construction of the FTL shell metric. It was painfully disorienting to look at, or would have been to ordinary humans; that\'s what the textbooks said, anyway.

Then the ion thrusters on her suit fired, canceling her inertia, and she realized that the moment she had cleared the ship\'s artificial gravity, there was nothing left to impede the speed of her jump, and she would have kept going otherwise. The counter‐acceleration had kept her barely within the ship\'s forcefield, which provided a modicum of protection as the others emerged.

*It happens,* Clarisse thought, having been the one to toggle the rockets. *Stay focused.*

Ryouko wondered for a moment why Clarisse hadn\'t just warned her beforehand, since the device could read her thoughts, but instead thought to herself:

*None of us have any idea what we\'re doing.*

*We need to do this quickly!* Ryouko thought, to the others. *We have to take what surprise we can get!*

To their credit, she hadn\'t really needed to say that; all seven of the others had followed readily in her wake.

*Too late!* Ngo Thi An thought.

The girl in question threw up a bright orange barrier, coursing with tendrils of light, just in time to intercept an incoming laser bombardment, both the ship\'s forcefield and the barrier shimmering with the effort of absorption and dispersion. Their telekinesis and magnetism specialist seized a set of missiles heading towards them, pushing them onto wildly irrelevant trajectories, one even heading back towards its source.

*Damn, the squid responded fast!* and *How did I even know there were lasers there?* competed for attention in her mind, but instead she teleported over to a certain Adriana Calderas, melee fighter and conjuror.

*...Targeting... passenger... bastards... transmitter... damaged, Laplace transmitted, rather unsuccessfully.

Inside her helmet, her breathing seemed suddenly extremely loud.

It was no longer time for talking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sustained ship‐to‐ship combat in the presence of FTL was constrained by the need of the attacking ships to stay within the FTL shell of the defending ship or ships. This necessitated matching velocities to within at least one times lightspeed and maintaining it. Otherwise, the difficulty of getting weapons into the FTL shell, combined with the sheer difficulty of hitting an object moving faster than light relative to oneself---not even theoretically possible for most weapons, though it depended on trajectory---made an attack little more than a futile gesture. Only heavy FTL‐denial weapons, such as the SHERMAN main gun or Eviscerator laser, and various more‐or‐less reliable FTL interference devices could upset those dynamics.

Practically, this meant that the alien fighters were obliged to maintain quite low speeds relative to Laplace, which had a fairly small FTL shell only a few dozen kilometers across. If any of the fighters gained too much relative velocity, especially astern, it was liable to drop out of the shell entirely, the resulting gravitational distortions generating an enormous separation of distance.

There were various accessory details to be considered: as much as was possible, Laplace would try to maneuver within the FTL shell, as well as use its engines and those of its accompanying droneships to reshape the shell to kick attackers out. The attackers would counter this by modulating their own engines.

Occasionally, if one side had a strong advantage in engine power or in total mass, it would make the decision to destabilize the shell entirely, blowing everyone involved widely separate. It was a risky move, and rarely done.

The upshot was: the alien fighters would not be moving at fast---or even relativistic---speeds, relative to Laplace or the magical girls surrounding it.

This did not mean they were slow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Gravity powers seem like just the thing,* Asami had thought earlier, but I don\'t know if I have enough control over it to safely use too much power. I\'m not sure I can manage it correctly in this kind of environment.*

*If it comes to it, do what you can,* Ryouko had thought. *Hold back if you have to, but you have to try.*

Adriana and Ryouko maintained careful contact, as they hurtled themselves through the vacuum by combined thruster and telekinetic push, trying to match vector with one of the alien fighters, as Ryouko blinked to avoid attacks, collisions with friendly drones, and even friendly fire from the drone gun platforms and the still active Laplace. In this airless, gravity‐less environment, it was possible to achieve astounding speeds.

Despite all of that, she maintained a certain cold‐blooded focus, a mixture of battle tension, subtle desperation, and a predatory desire to take down her enemy.

*Come on,* Ryouko thought, eyeing an alien fighter that they were coming close to matching velocities with, its movements restricted by a steady barrage of impossibly‐fast icicles launched by one of the other girls, laser fire from Laplace, and one of the gravitational anomalies Asami was using to try and manipulate the battlefield.

As a whole, Asami, who Ryouko could barely see from this distance---and hardly had time to look at anyway---seemed to be conducting herself rather well, accelerating powerfully using a personal anomaly, easily diverting missiles and projectiles away from herself, and using a cloud of debris to mitigate laser fire. The alien fighters were visibly struggling to turn and accelerate properly under her influence. It was astoundingly useful.

*Yes!* the ice mage thought, as one of the fighters on the other side of Laplace broke apart in a mass of shrapnel under the combined weight of icicles, suicide drones, and the ship\'s aft guns.

Ryouko smiled slightly, but only for a moment.

*Come on,* she thought, blinking the two of them out of the path of a laser shot she had somehow anticipated. A moment later, Adriana, who she was pulling by the hand, conjured and almost instantly dispelled a ten‐meter‐wide steel wall to their left, which lasted just long enough to deflect a hurtling piece of metal debris.

When the moment finally arrived, and their velocities were closely enough aligned, she blinked directly next to the fighter\'s forcefields, the two of them moving in near‐perfect synchronicity with the ship. That was something she required: she could not change velocity by teleporting.

She had only an instant to take in the pitch‐black, nearly indistinguishable alien hull, the strangely bulbous design, the slightly protruding forcefield generator.

And then Adriana slammed downward on the ship with both fists, gleaming gold triangular knuckles suddenly searingly bright against the forcefield. The instant the forcefield failed under the weight of that force, two giant steel blades, shaped like triangles and as tall as the two of them combined, appeared before her fists and rammed forward into the fighter.

Ryouko blinked them out, and they were conscious of the ship\'s exotic matter containment failing behind them, the material blowing itself and the ship apart.

There was a very brief moment for Ryouko to review the situation. Laplace\'s drone counts seemed to have mostly stabilized, excepting suicide drones. This was likely due to their no longer being a serious target. Still, by now, his drone complement was quite low, and unlikely to be helpful.

*Ryouko,* Meiqing thought.

Ryouko didn\'t need an explanation. Reading the necessary information off of their internal communications, she took a long ten seconds to charge a longer teleport, as Adriana protected the two of them.

She re‐emerged next to Meiqing, Adriana dove away to fend for herself, and she turned her attention to her new destination.

*How exactly does your power work, Meiqing?* Ryouko had asked earlier, while they were still in the cargo hold. *I mean, earth powers are nice and all, but does that even mean anything out in space?*

*Well, specifically, I can manipulate the outer surface of any planetary body with a sufficiently high surface gravity. The rules for what "outer surface\" *means are sort of hard to explain, but that\'s the gist of it. Not as broad as telekinesis, but I\'m a lot more powerful with the things I can control. It\'s a tradeoff.*

*What defines* planetary body? Ryouko had pressed. *Would a ship count?*

Meiqing had thought about it for a moment.

*Yes, actually, but it\'d have to be a fairly big ship. I can give you an exact number, but I\'m thinking something maybe twenty kilometers in diameter. We\'re talking---well, actually, no kind of ship I know about.*

*But it depends on surface gravity specifically?* Ryouko had asked. *Not something else?*

*Yes.*

Ryouko teleported Meiqing and herself next to another of the fighters, one that was still flying freely in close proximity to another one, except that Asami had contrived to increase its surface gravity to a tiny two centimeters per second squared. Tiny enough to require essentially no effort on Asami\'s part, and also roughly the surface gravity of a twenty‐kilometer asteroid.

This time, Ryouko\'s velocity was only poorly matched, so the fighter rapidly sped away from them, but it didn\'t matter. Meiqing was close enough.

The fighter stopped abruptly in its tracks, Meiqing seizing the vessel and sealing its weapons ports. She hurled the vessel directly into the path of the other fighter, setting up a head‐on collision. Before the alien pilot could respond, the other fighter\'s AI attempted to veer away automatically, but not fast enough.

The mutual collision resulted in a satisfying dual‐forcefield failure and total destruction.

There was only one fighter left, but before it could be destroyed, it gunned its thrusters and performed an emergency exit of the FTL shell, its escape causing a perturbation that briefly sent the tortured light from that part of the sky spinning.

*Hmpf, it ran,* Meiqing thought, as they regathered near the ship.

*No,* Laplace transmitted, apparently having finally brought his transmitters back online. *It\'s coming back for another pass. Check your tactical readouts.*

*He\'s right,* Asami thought, without bothering to explain how she knew. But we have time; he\'s pretty far away.*

*It\'s likely trying to do another weapons drop,* Laplace thought. *I have no idea why they\'re so determined to destroy us today.*

*Then let\'s shoot it out of the sky when it remerges with the shell, Ryouko thought. *This kind of timing thing is exactly what we\'re good at, or so Clarisse keeps telling me.*

For once they had plenty of time. The ice mage nearby spent the time growing an icicle to incredible size: perhaps fifteen meters long. Adriana summoned one of her signature metal pieces, entrusting it for the telekinetic to throw.

Ryouko, for her part, reached deep, and summoned her Scorpion.

The giant artillery piece floated in front of her, obviously weighing nothing, and she settled in to wait the remaining seconds.

When the moment came, and the fighter appeared in their sky for an unimaginably small amount of time, it was immediately speared by no less than three projectiles, in a feat of timing that should have been impossible. They watched expectantly for the ship to tear itself apart.

Ryouko felt a sudden burning pain, one that seemed to emanate not from any one source, but from the entire front of her body. She instinctively reached up in desperation for her helmet. Exclamations of pain sounded in her mind from the others.

*Hostiles ter... minated,* Clarisse thought, strangely sluggish. Seve... re radiation...*

〈**PROTECTIVE FUGUE INITIATED**〉

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The alien fighter had, in a last suicidal attack, configured its core to disintegrate in a particularly radiation‐heavy manner---and ejected the core just before entering their FTL shell, entrusting its own residual shell to carry both ship and core in. It had fully expected to get shot down immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*You know, all in all, we were pretty lucky,* Clarisse thought. *My post‐combat review indicates at least ten other mistakes that could have gotten you killed, had the enemy had heavier weapons.*

Ryouko grunted in annoyance, from her reclined position on the bed. She had her \"window\" set to transparent, so it was displaying a soothing starfield, carefully reprocessed to remove the distortions of the FTL shell. Her scant personal effects, including the now ever‐present CubeBot, lay scattered across a nearby dresser. All in all, the room was small, since space on a starship was usually precious. It contained a bed, a dresser, a small desk, and a small closet.

*Read the mood, why don\'t you?* she thought. *No one wants to talk about this right now.*

She raised her hand up in front of her. The peeling had finally stopped, but the red spots dotting her skin still looked angry and bloody. She wondered what her face looked like but, on second thought, had no desire to check.

Well, it had only been sixteen hours. Without an MG healer, it was too much to expect more, even with blood nanites, the full force of the ship\'s modern infirmary, and soul gem healing. Speaking of which, her soul gem had apparently gotten pretty low while she was out---using the Scorpion had been a mistake. She should have recharged first, but fortunately the ship, with its grief cube stores, was able to recover them.

It was fine now, though.

*Speaking of reviewing the past,* Clarisse thought, *I was filing some of your more recent memories and discovered something rather interesting or, perhaps, disturbing.*

*Yes?*

*Well...*

The room faded away from her for a moment, and a familiar face appeared before her, the face of a woman with overflowing, shockingly pink hair, white ribbons, and golden eyes. The woman put a gloved finger to her lips, and winked.

Then the vision---or rather, the memory reconstruction---disappeared, and she again found herself looking at her sparsely decorated passenger cabin.

*Since when could you do that?* she demanded, almost indignantly.

*Since I unexpectedly recovered the memory of your vision during routine filing,* Clarisse thought. *And, no, I\'m not supposed to be able to. I must say, my confidence in the tenets of this Cult is much higher than it used to be.*

Ryouko put her hand above her head, on her pillow, shifting her gaze upward slightly.

*Can you do anything with it?* she thought, trying to think through the implications. *Broadcast it, anything like that?*

*No, unfortunately,* Clarisse thought. *It\'s kind of interesting. Literally the only thing I can do is play it back to you. Everything else I\'ve tried, it\'s almost as if there is no memory.*

*That\'s... strange,* Ryouko thought.

*Yes,* Clarisse thought. *It\'s hard to explain, but I have a lot of built‐in tools that are not working on this, so I have to draw a copy manually, if it can be called that. Analogous to an artist drawing something by memory. I\'m... working on it.*

Ryouko thought for a moment. There was a question she wanted to ask, and it seemed relevant at the moment.

*Clarisse, are you sentient?*

For a moment, she thought her TacComp wouldn\'t answer, but then the device thought:

*That\'s a rather sudden question.*

*I\'m curious, and I sort of want to know what exactly I\'ve got sitting on my spine.*

There was another pause.

*I think I am. But from your perspective, that\'s insufficient to prove anything. The only way to prove anything would be a Volokhov analysis on my current state, which would be technically challenging.*

Ryouko thought for a moment.

*That\'s good enough for me, though I don\'t know what exactly I\'m supposed to do about it. Does it bother you being my servant?*

*Only if I try to think about it in a philosophical sense. Better not to worry, I think. Starships don\'t sit around being bothered that they never got a chance to be anything else. Speaking of which, Laplace is an interesting ship, if a bit quirky.*

*Huh,* Ryouko thought, drawing the obvious implication that Clarisse was spending time talking to the ship behind her back.

*If anything, I\'d be more concerned about the fact that we\'re not part of the fully‐validated computing framework, unlike AIs. We\'re pretty well designed, and the electronic components are Volokhov‐friendly, but as for the organic components, no one knows. The designers will have to face the music sometime, and I don\'t know what they\'re going to say. The way I think about it, though, most Humans are Volokhov‐friendly, by definition, and we\'re made of the same stuff, organized in mostly similar fashion. Oh, I\'m not worried about myself, but other Version Twos, obviously.*

Ryouko just blinked, not really sure what to say in response to the somewhat confusing train of thought. It was the longest continuous chain of musings Clarisse had produced yet, and unlike so much of her other thoughts, had little direct bearing on Ryouko herself. Was Clarisse... chatting?

*I guess I am talking too much,* Clarisse thought, responding---as she sometimes did---to Ryouko\'s implicit thought. *Anyway, what do you think about Asami‐chan?*

Ryouko would have tilted her head if she weren\'t lying on a pillow.

*What about her?* she thought.

*That\'s what I thought. Nothing important. You should sleep and heal off some of that radiation damage.*

*I guess.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By the time they finally landed on the ground at Charon starport---yet another day later---most of the radiation damage had healed off, aided by the ship\'s substantial grief cube stockpiles.

As their ship descended through the atmosphere, the shockwave of descent mitigated by a partial anti‐grav assist, the group of them crowded the viewing ports---by this point no longer required to stay in bed for health purposes, with even most of the cosmetic radiation damage having worn off.

Compared to the cities of Earth, Charon was not a particularly impressive city. As they entered final descent, and the city\'s buildings began to look like more than just square insets on the gray‐and‐white ground, Ryouko mused that it would have been possible to see the far edge of the city, the point where the urban concentration began to fade and open land became more visible, from one of the taller buildings in the vicinity. This feat was usually impossible within the crowded megapolises of Earth.

They had been briefed on what to expect upon arrival. Garrison‐duty, while relatively serious on the edge of the frontier, was considerably more relaxed at great distance from the front, which was why it was possible to justify shipping newly trained girls into the area for week‐long shifts, to join a few veterans on longer‐term relief rotations. Here, the more conventional human garrison consisted of a single regular infantry division, again on a relief rotation, along with a larger contingent of colonial militia. Heavy weapons were rare.

Combat threats consisted of rare fighter raids, a theoretical risk of bombardment raids, and the possibility of commando raids to destroy or disrupt critical installations, such as its sulfur mines, whose output was destined for export to agricultural or industrial worlds. Charon was the principal off‐world trading center, whose civilian population and facilities they would be designated to defend in the event of attack.

It had sounded like a vacation when they had first read up on it, learning that the last major enemy action of note was a months‐old bomber raid on the planet\'s orbital fuel plants, which was after all a Navy responsibility, not theirs. Still, after the experience on the transport, Ryouko was a bit more wary of assurances that the aliens rarely ever ventured so deep into Human space.

The first thing they noticed was the blue‐green sky and red‐tinted sun, obvious even during descent. It was expected; the planet\'s volcanism had a decided effect on the passage of light to the surface.

The second thing they noticed was the ambient temperature as they stepped into the starport.

\"It\'s hot,\" Meiqing said unnecessarily, peering up through a sky panel at the sky. \"You\'d think with all this atmospheric dust it wouldn\'t be this warm.\"

One of the advantages of having a universally enhanced population was that one could have much less regard for climate control of buildings. On Earth, many buildings were allowed to freely oscillate in temperature, secure in the knowledge that the comfort zones of their inhabitants were very, very wide. It appeared that the same was true of the colonies, as indicated by the fact that the starport was a very balmy forty‐five degrees Celsius, according to her internal thermometer.

\"The planet is still young, so geothermal heat is still highly relevant,\" Ryouko said. \"And we\'re very close to the star.\"

\"Yeah, I know,\" Meiqing said automatically, by now used to Ryouko\'s literal‐minded corrections. \"I read about the planet too.\"

A militia officer greeted them as they stepped into---what was this? A terminal? That was what Clarisse called it, anyway.

After they were done exchanging greetings and gawking around at the gray, unfamiliarly utilitarian starport architecture, they followed up by gawking some more on their way to the shuttle, at the rows of shops dispensing food, drinks, entertainment, and other assorted conveniences. Crowds of people milled about, doing---well, Ryouko had no idea what they were doing.

\"They\'re waiting,\" the officer said, before any of them ventured to ask, clearly reciting a prepared explanation. \"The transportation networks out here aren\'t as perfectly efficient as Earth, and a lot of people need to arrive from far away, so they get here early.\"

\"And the shops are Capitalism,\" Ryouko said, making the mental connection.

The others nodded.

\"Earth must be an interesting place,\" one of the other girls, not a native Earther, said, looking at the rest of them skeptically. She had nothing to gawk at, obviously.

\"A lot of things are different out here,\" the officer said, smiling with a hint of sardonicism.

Whatever urge they might have had to explore and perhaps buy something went unfulfilled, as they were hustled into a waiting group vehicle. Looking out at the city, with its complete lack of aboveground traffic tubes and seemingly chaotic vehicle traffic, was an enlightening experience. Smaller colonies generally had the necessary prebuilt infrastructure to support a more elaborate traffic control system, except for cluttersome traffic tubes, but rarely implemented full traffic control as long as population density was low, usually finding it sufficient to implement basic automated driving, coordinated speeds, and the low bit of intelligence necessary to prevent stopping at intersections.

It was one thing knowing that intellectually; another thing entirely to undergo the unnerving experience of driving through an intersection at full speed, seemingly barely avoiding a collision. Another thing that seemed obvious in retrospect, but had come unexpectedly: "advertisements\", in the form of giant \"billboards\" that appeared to react to whoever passed by, generally hawking tourist goods in their direction. Apparently they were encouraged to buy little souvenir volcanoes, vials of sulfur compounds, and submit‐it‐yourself designs for T‐shirts commenting on the heat. Also, there were hot springs, as if anyone would want to bake themselves any further in this climate.

Clarisse then informed her helpfully that without government privacy restrictions, advertisers would almost certainly prefer to access one\'s internal viewspace and advertise that way; the TacComp had already turned down numerous requests for just such access.

Still, while the cityscape was novel compared to Earth, it quickly became obvious that there was very little in terms of genuine sights and monuments. The Earth cities Ryouko had visited on family vacations and school trips had generally had their fair share of monuments and ancient buildings, reconstructed or otherwise, and one could often detect, under the shell of modernity, the shadow of history. Here, there was none of that.

And, despite the somewhat lower traffic speed, the trip was short. The city was not that large, and it was only in about fifteen minutes that they reached their designated lodgings. It was reasonably close to the city\'s regular infantry barracks, but separate from the base itself, as suited officer lodgings. In a fact that had been occasionally implied but never explicitly stated, it was also suitable placement for a group of what were still teenage girls, away from the considerably older infantry.

Ryouko wondered at the wisdom of placing so many of the city\'s magical girls in one location. On the other hand, they were still divided into numerous clusters over the settled area of the planet, and this was hardly a true warzone. Far from it, it was becoming obvious.

They were the second of the two groups of their training cohort that would be housed here, and she expected a few of the others to be there to welcome them.

She didn\'t expect a full welcoming committee, with all seven other girls waiting for them at the surface entrance---Ryouko still instinctively kept track of what floor entrances were on---to greet them.

It had been surprising to see them all gathered as their vehicle pulled up to the curb next to the unfamiliarly short building. It had been downright unsettling when they got out, into the warm, foul‐smelling air, onto the unfamiliar pavement, and the other girls began filtering into them, shaking hands and making comments to the effect of \"Great job out there!\" and \"What was it like?\"

It took her a moment to realize what was going on, but finally, she understood. They were heroes. Minor heroes, but heroes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They underwent initial orientation, touring the local base with one of the more permanently stationed girls, a certain Selécine Kabila, who was on a demon hunting \"relaxation\" rotation. They learned that their duties were as limited as their previous reading had implied---they were to familiarize themselves with the combat resources and layout of the area, introduce themselves to local commanders, and respond to any alarms raised by the planetary monitoring systems. But, since they were only passing by on a very transient basis, they weren\'t expected to integrate themselves any more deeply than that.

At the end of their tour, they shook hands with a local \"Major General of Volunteers\"---a weird term intended to contrast with the regular military, even though the regular military was also almost entirely voluntary. Selécine then explained that, since it was a religious holiday for the Church of Hope, the Church members in the area would be holding a party later that night, and that they were all welcome to attend.

Though the girls uniformly agreed to consider it, attendance was low, only six of them RSVP\'ing to the list and meeting Selécine outside the building at the designated time of 23:00 local time---19:00 Mitakihara Time---and one of them, Asami, was mostly just following her. Ryouko wondered how exactly the Cult kept up recruiting, at this rate.

It didn\'t matter; Ryouko had her own reasons. She had looked up what exact holiday they were celebrating.

*October Three* was its rather strange name. The birthday of the Goddess, one of the few pieces of information that the Cult had, based on a similar remembrance held yearly by Akemi Homura until her disappearance.

Ryouko, who had more reason than most to believe in the existence of such a Goddess, felt that the evidence was compelling enough for her to attend a birthday party held on the Goddess\'s behalf. It felt like the right thing to do, if she had indeed once been human. Even Clarisse agreed, now that the device had personal evidence of the encounter, though Clarisse had couched it in terms of possible future pay‐off, which seemed a little crass.

She had feared some sort of somber, awkward religious ceremony, but it turned out Selécine had not been kidding when she had described the gathering as a party. Homura had apparently once said that the Goddess would have preferred it that way.

\"So after we got here, it seems like someone\'s TacComp had the bright idea to do some research on the jewelry you\'re always wearing,\" Asami said, watching her over the top of a giant glass of some sort of fruit‐ice concoction. \"I didn\'t know it was a family thing.\"

\"It\'s not really that big a deal,\" Ryouko said, looking aside briefly, putting a hand to her hair. \"It just might be useful if I run into any of them in the future. That\'s how I think of it.\"

She felt awkward in her formal dress, partly because she rarely wore it, partly because it was too formal for the party and she had nothing intermediate, and partly because it seemed to run strongly counter to the fashion trends of the colony, which ran heavily in the direction of scanty---which made sense, given the heat. Then again, she would have felt awkwardly exposed wearing any of the things the other girls were wearing, and at least Asami was in the same boat.

At least there was plenty of space. She had heard that space was cheap in the colonies, but this apartment seemed huge to her eye, even compared to her paternal grandparents\' place in the suburbs. Consequently, they didn\'t have to rub elbows with anyone, which she had never previously realized she was annoyed by---until now, that was.

\"Hmm, well after this recent incident,\" Asami said, looking her in the eye seriously, but seeming tired, \"some of them are saying that it proves you have the family stuff, whatever that means. Makes you a better catch, in other words.\"

\"Right, right,\" Ryouko deflected, pretending to find interest in something happening across the room. It was not a topic she really wanted to think about.

\"I don\'t think that\'s fair, if you don\'t mind me saying so,\" Asami continued. \"I mean, the rest of us were there too, but suddenly it\'s like just because you have the family names, what you do is more memorable. Expected of you, or something. Even if you did show great leadership.\"

Ryouko snapped back to attention.

\"What? Leadership?\" she asked.

\"Good evening,\" Selécine said, appearing at their table. This particular girl kept a young physical age, like everyone there, but was strictly speaking a Major, and for once her appearance made it vaguely plausible; the girl\'s sharp brown features and reserved hairstyle made her seem older than her \"age\".

\"Am I interrupting anything?\" she asked, a moment later, sitting at one of the remaining chairs.

\"Oh, no,\" Asami said politely.

For a moment the girl just looked at the two of them silently.

\"So how are you finding your drink?\" Selécine asked, looking at Asami.

Ryouko missed whatever response Asami might have made, because Selécine simultaneously thought to her:

*Have you told your friend why you\'re here?*

Ryouko blinked in surprise, then hid her expression, pretending to listen to the conversation.

*What do you mean?* she thought, testing if the other girl meant what she thought she meant.

*Your vision. The Mother made sure we were informed that you were one of the lucky ones. I take it you haven\'t mentioned anything to Asami here, then?*

*The Mother? You mean Kyouko?* Ryouko thought. *Uh, no, I haven\'t.*

*You call her Kyouko,* Selécine thought, amused, still looking for all the world as if she were completely fascinated in the meaningless conversation she was foisting on Asami. *That\'d be meaningful in Japanese, but since we\'re speaking Standard, I can\'t tell if it means anything, though I thought you might call her Sakura instead.*

Ryouko wrinkled her brow slightly at the strange comment, then relaxed.

*Yes, she\'s not big on formalities,* she thought. *I\'m sure you know about the mentorship thing.*

*Of course,* the other girl thought. *She was sure you\'d come here, you know, after your experience, to celebrate the Goddess\'s birthday.*

Ryouko took her time responding, taking a moment to listen to Asami opine happily on the diversification of fruit strains in the colonies. She noticed that, strangely, Selécine sounded much older telepathically than in speech.

*It seemed like the right thing to do,* she thought.

*You do believe in the Goddess, then?*

Ryouko took a breath, the bright image of the pink‐haired woman flashing through her mind again. She remembered what Clarisse had said.

*It seems definitely likely that she exists,* she thought, without elaborating.

Instead of relaying an explicit thought, Selécine relayed a frisson of amusement.

*Well, I won\'t pry,* the girl thought. *But, are you interested in joining our Church? The Mother would be pleased.*

*Not right now,* Ryouko thought, trying to convey bluntness. *Maybe later, but right now I don\'t think I want to. After all, if I have my reading of doctrine correct, she saves everyone regardless of whether I even believe she exists or not. So, you know...*

Ryouko smiled sheepishly, hoping it didn\'t seem weird to Asami if she saw it.

Instead of being offended, Selécine seemed amused again.

*That is correct,* the other girl thought. *Well, we\'ll see about the future, won\'t we?*

There was a moment of mental silence, while Ryouko thought further.

*It\'d be nice if Akemi Homura would just answer questions, wouldn\'t it?* Ryouko thought. *Instead of disappearing like that.*

That surprised the other girl, who lost a beat in her ongoing conversation with Asami, before recovering and thinking:

*Well, of course. Why do you think we\'re looking for her?*

Suddenly, Clarisse pulled her attention back to the conversation, and Ryouko, based on the TacComp\'s recording of the conversation, was able to quickly say:

\"Oh, yeah, I think durian tastes terrible, too. I have no idea why anyone would like it.\"

Suddenly realizing she had left her drink strangely untouched, Ryouko grabbed her pineapple‐like drink and chugged part of it, in a rather unladylike manner.

\"Well, for what it\'s worth, I hear it tastes completely different after the military smell enhancements,\" Selécine said. \"But, uh---\"

The girl gestured in the direction of a far wall, and they turned. Ryouko\'s eyes swept over the rest of the room, past the larger main table, kitchen area, and living area, another room that seemed to serve no real purpose except to add more space. Finally, her eyes fell on a distant 2D projection, flattening against the living room wall where most of the girls were gathered. Within the image, Kyouko was preparing to give a sermon somewhere on far‐off Earth, standing at her podium with trademark apple. She looked out over an imaginary crowd, radiating a kind of serene, happy authority that seemed decidedly at odds with what Ryouko saw normally.

The room quieted, and Ryouko settled in. This would be interesting.

\"We are here to remember, and commemorate. Not just a sacrifice, but a life, though it is a life we know so little about. We are here to remember a girl whose life no longer exists, so that in our memory, at least, it will still be intact. We do not do this in exchange for future reward---our reward is assured---but merely as a gesture, a thanksgiving, so that the Goddess may remember what it\'s like to be human. Centuries ago, when our prophet was new to this world...\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"...and thus, as was once said, let us eat, drink, and make merry. The Goddess wants us to celebrate, and celebrate we shall. The best we can do is to strive to live our lives well, and that we shall try to do. Thank you.\"

The room erupted in applause, and Maki participated politely, but unlike the others, she was finding it difficult to obey the sentiment. She stared at the eyes of the holographic girl before them, those beautiful cold eyes, unbearably ancient, and wondered.

## Discontinuity 

> One of the linchpins of the economy of Human Governance, instantaneous interstellar communication was one of the last of the \"miracle\" technologies to emerge from the postwar period, not reaching full development until after the actual colonization of the three Core Worlds that formed the first colonization wave. Since the development of such a technology was hardly certain, relying after all on novel physics, Governance had formed its colonization plans on the assumption that interplanetary communication would rely entirely on data carried by relatively slow FTL starships. With the actualization of the *IIC Relay* system, colonization schemes were quickly redesigned, with plans made for a greatly expanded second colonization wave. Easy communication made possible colonial economies that would be much closer knit, single‐currency zones that could extend over multiple systems, and, perhaps most importantly, a much greater degree of central control and cultural influence.
>
> By this point in time, well into the early part of the second colonization wave, the governments and cultures of the first‐wave Core Worlds had already developed substantial independence from Earth, an occurrence that had been grudgingly anticipated and tolerated by Governance. Although this development could not be easily reversed, Governance would make sure that its influence on later colony worlds would be substantially more direct. While colony worlds were afforded a measure of independence and self‐rule, Governance now found itself capable of enforcing certain legal policies---and, more importantly, its ideology---far more effectively than it had anticipated, and it used this ability freely. Moreover, Governance could now much more effectively manage the economy of the *Human Governance* as a whole, ensuring that it could perpetually lurk over the shoulder of the colony worlds\' Capitalist economies, adjusting capital flows as it saw fit. In this, it could wield the powerful bludgeon of Earth\'s enormous manufacturing capacity---but it had to do so carefully: while Earth\'s manufacturing capacity could supply all the needs of the colonies entirely by itself, this would effectively extend Earth\'s command economy over all of Human space, an inefficient result. Consequently, Earth‐Colonial trade was strictly controlled, and Earth\'s surplus was carefully diverted into industrial expansion in the colonies.
>
> Control and cultural interchange are limited principally by three important factors. Firstly, restrictive policies on civilian immersive VR prevent interstellar communication from achieving the fidelity of face‐to‐face interaction, a necessity for true cultural synchrony. Secondly, the IIC Relay system, while free of the limitations of transmission latency, suffers from continual bandwidth and routing limitations, due to the high costs of constructing and maintaining even one IIC relay. Many colony worlds have only one, and non‐Governance sponsored colonies often have none. Governance Representatives and military officials, occupying the highest priority slots, can experience fluid, low‐latency communication, but for everyone else IIC‐time is a precious resource. Installing the massive bandwidth it would take to make large colonial governments mere extensions of Earth Governance would be extremely expensive. Finally, Governance does not feel it in its interests to enforce too much homogeneity, for the same reasons that it tries to prevent a total monoculture from appearing on Earth; it feels that the loss of cultural diversity does carry some cost, and that a greater variety of cultures provides greater civilizational robustness should a cataclysmic event occur.
>
> With the arrival of the Cephalopods and the demonstration of a working example of instantaneous interstellar travel, research into the fundamentals of the IIC relay system is now at a feverish pitch, in the hopes that IIC contains within it the secrets of the alien Paradox Drive.

> Those nations that survived the Unification Wars the most intact, generally the United Front and MSY\'s core nations, have as a legacy of the wars a substantial population of ethnically foreign residents, partly due to a massive influx of war refugees and their descendants, but also due to the natural consequences of the UF\'s globe‐spanning military and governmental operations. UF core nations found themselves acting as transit points for military units from almost every imaginable source, and sent military units to the far corners of the globe, only to receive them back accompanied by a baggage train full of rescued freedom fighters, hanger‐ons, and newfound lovers. Due to the exigencies of war, the UF Executive Committee and later EDC were in little mood for parochial or nativist sentiments from constituent nations, routinely overriding diplomatic protests in order to establish new refugee settlements, and pressuring governments to relax citizenship requirements.
>
> While many such new residents returned to their homelands postwar, many others chose to settle down, preferring not to return to what was often a wasteland. Immediately postwar, the UF EDC was extremely sensitive to the possibility of fragmentation, and used the lack of borders in the new super‐state to encourage migration in all directions. People moved to find jobs, to join family in new nations, or simply to find a better life---and postwar, this could usually be found in the nations that had survived the war most intact.
>
> Consequently, the ethnic compositions of many prewar nation‐states were transformed, with some formerly homogeneous regions finding their populations to be as much as twenty percent minority. While ethnic tensions occasionally flared up, EDC punishment was harsh, and most of the populace proved to be exhausted of violence due to the war. Over the centuries, as global integration proceeded, cultural divisions faded, allowing the world\'s cultures to blend into what would later be maligned as the \"monoculture\". While this loss of cultural diversity would eventually come to alarm Governance, it had the side effect of triggering the heavy assimilation of minority peoples into their host nations---which were becoming indistinguishable from their homelands anyway. In the end, the result was curious: ethnically diverse nations that, after centuries of intermarriage and cultural integration, hardly seemed to be diverse at all.

*Tomoe Mami would like to inform you that she has started the simulation, and will be ready for you whenever you choose to join.*

Kyouko nodded, a habit she still couldn\'t break despite having spent well over a decade with one of these contraptions in her head---well, spine, but whatever.

Setting her old‐fashioned tablet down onto the desk next to her, she stretched luxuriously, or as luxuriously as she could in the tiny alcove that she called her bed. It was easier in this small body than it would have been in one of her more adult forms, but it was still cramped. She remembered hating sleeping in the alcove as a child, until they had been able to move into a house near the church, rather than being obliged to live within the church itself. That was just before her father had started preaching outside the doctrine.

In retrospect, she wasn\'t sure why she had had this room reconstructed. It was a form of austerity, sure, but was she implicitly rejecting the doctrines her father preached?

Of course not. Her father had been ahead of his time, in many ways. But the Central Church had refused to listen, and because they refused to listen, the people didn\'t listen. It was... a very good metaphor for religion today.

Well, religion except her Church.

It was a form of nostalgia, she suspected. Despite the poor memories she had of the room, her overall memory of that stage of her childhood was quite bright, certainly brighter than the hungry times, or the times after that.

Sometimes she dreamed of her sister. Afterward, she would wonder: Knowing what she knew now, what fate would she have preferred for Momo‐chan? A long and happy life, dying of old age while her eternally young *onee‐chan* watched over her? Or perhaps Kyouko would have preferred that her sister contract as well, so that even now, they could still be together.

And the afterlife: What was it like? What would it be like, meeting her again? Meeting Sayaka again? Meeting... her father again?

She shook her head at herself, perhaps annoyed. Now, in her old age, she found herself ruminating on such things more and more, waxing nostalgic about the ancient past, casting her eye more to the sky and less to the ground. Perhaps that, too, was why she chose to sleep in this small alcove. It reminded her of when she had been young.

Plus, for what it was worth, a cramped space provided for interesting variations on---

She frowned, popsicle in her mouth suddenly turning sour. That was not where she had wanted this train of thought to go.

She had been watching a recording of her earlier performance, on her outdated holographic tablet, annotating and reviewing. It hadn\'t been bad, but something about her body language was off.

Unbelievable. It was the Goddess\'s birthday, and still all she could think about was her regrets. Momo‐chan, her family, Sayaka, Yuma, Mami, Homura... plenty of others, but also Maki.

Damn that girl for getting into her head! To some degree, she prided herself on not being like Mami, not letting herself be weighed down by every damn thing, but one stormy breakup later, and suddenly here she was, brooding just like Mami would. And it wasn\'t like this was her first bad separation. She really was getting old.

Well, at least it was clear she would never be Yuma or Homura, with their ability to place human lives and happiness on a scale and reason their way into terrible actions, blood icy cold the entire way, justifying it with vague gestures toward the afterlife or the greater good. In a way, she was proud that she wasn\'t like them, despite the implicit praise the Incubators used to ladle in their direction, urging her to be more like them. As if!

And Yuma turning out that way had been her fault, at least partly. If she had been more---

*Okay, seriously, this is too much,* Kyouko thought. *No more.*

She accepted Mami\'s invitation, lay back down on her bed, and closed her eyes, waited for the world to fade.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Well, that took forever,\" Yuma complained, when Kyouko opened her virtual eyes. The tiny girl at her feet glared up at her with a faux‐angry expression.

\"What were you doing, anyway?\" the girl continued. \"I thought you broke up with your girlfriend! Or did you get a new one that fast?\"

Inwardly, Kyouko groaned, hoping she wasn\'t showing it. She was trying not* to think about that.

\"Firstly, I was on Church business,\" Kyouko lied, using her height to look down on Yuma. \"Secondly, I don\'t appreciate the government---that means you---snooping on my affairs. And thirdly, given how much you talk about it, maybe you should try it sometime. It\'s relaxing.\"

Yuma\'s expression became sardonic.

\"Suggesting lewd things to your imouto again, nee‐chan?\"

Kyouko ignored her, bending down to scoop the girl up into her arms. It was actually quite the feat, since the apparent age disparity wasn\'t that* great, but these things didn\'t matter to a magical girl. Not to mention she could have just adjusted the virtuality if it were really necessary.

She took a moment to spin Yuma around in her arms, smiling goofily, the virtual apartment spinning around them. It was decorated in a spartan style---simple white walls, single glass table and small black sofa. Attached to this bleak living room was a kitchen devoid of anything but a single box‐like synthesizer, merged with a dining room with a single, surprisingly large table, almost completely unused.

Only two things caught one\'s eye about the room. One was the glass doors leading out to the balcony and the view beyond, a bird\'s eye panorama of Mitakihara City below, and the sky above. Given that the era of this simulation was modern---or, rather, *future*---it implied the apartment was almost unbelievably high up, high enough to look down on the city.

The other was the ever‐shifting holographic wall surface opposite the sofa, the only thing that could be called flashy about the room. A wide array of miniature screens filled the wall, shifting to and fro, left and right, in and out of focus. Each screen was filled with a seemingly random snippet of factual text, or else some kind of diagram or image. Kyouko knew from experience that the master of this apartment often sat and watched the random screens for an unnerving amount of time, or just as often used it as a sort of interactive workspace, the screens becoming coherent and responding to her thoughts.

Just another one of those quirks that Homura had never deigned to explain.

In the later years, Homura had spent a considerable amount of time practicing and refining her digital artwork, often showing the rest of them some of her drawings. Some images were touching, almost‐heartwarming drawings of the bespectacled, pigtailed Homura from the distant past, or of Mami\'s coffee table, resplendent with platters full of cakes. Though it couldn\'t really be said that she had talent, she had acquired a certain honed competence from sheer volume of attempts.

But there were also the other images. Incoherent and random, they were as beautiful as they were disturbing. Homura did not explain, even when asked directly, preferring only to listen to their comments. A wasteland of sugar, candy, and hospital symbols; a red‐clad horseman---horse*woman*---whose head was replaced by a giant flaming candle; a clownish monstrosity, floating upside‐down in the sky, with gears under its dress; a pitch‐black mountain reaching up from a devastated, flooded landscape. Ironically, it was in these pictures that Homura hedged the closest to true artistic novelty: Kyouko had tremendous difficulty looking away from some of the pictures, which seemed to suck her in, reminding her of something atavistic.

As strangely mesmerizing as they had been, though, Kyouko had never come closer to doubting Homura\'s intrinsic sanity, as Mami did.

Even now, though Kyouko instinctively felt as if there was some connection between the images and the Goddess, Kyouko did not speak of it to the Church, nor had she ever. She could not conceptualize how it fit into the scheme of things---no, more accurately, she refused to believe the conceptions she did come up with.

Once, a few years after the founding of the Church, she had obtained access to the Black Heart vaults where Homura\'s personal files had ended up stored, away from the prying eyes of Governance or the lower tiers of the MSY. But try as she might, she could not find any sign of the images she had seen or, as she had hoped, any drawings referencing the Goddess. Nothing of use to the Church, in other words. Suspecting shenanigans, she had authorized her own agents to penetrate the Black Heart and search further, but they came up with nothing either. It was disturbing, and one of the reasons she refused to believe Homura was dead, though she could not speak of it.

All of that flashed through her mind, in impression rather than in detail, as she took Yuma for a playful spin: once, twice, thrice.

\"Really, how old are the two of you anyway?\" Mami said, appearing in the doorway to the dining area. \"And is it possible for us to go one of these events without dirty jokes floating around?\"

Kyouko sent Yuma back down on the floor.

\"Don\'t be such a drag, Mami,\" Kyouko said. \"Yuma\'s fun to play with.\"

\"I am four hundred fifty‐eight years old!\" Yuma said, reporting her age in the same excited tone a child would, with an undertone of mockery.

\"Hmm, well, either way, now that you\'re here, we can get to eating,\" Mami said, ignoring their comments.

She stood by the doorway as the other two passed by, but stopped Kyouko momentarily with a tug at her sleeve.

*I\'m keeping tabs on Kishida‐san,* she transmitted, relaying the message on a private channel. *She\'s doing fine so far.*

*We\'re over, Mami,* Kyouko transmitted, still walking, without giving any visible sign of the conversation.

*Why are you always like this?* Mami replied, watching the other girl\'s back. *Is it really so bad, settling down with someone? I think it\'d be good for you.*

*That\'s an interesting comment, coming from you,* Kyouko retorted, sitting down at the table. *Since it\'s not as if you have anyone.*

Mami started, taken aback. She struggled briefly to formulate a response.

*That\'s different and you know it,* Mami protested, finally, starting to follow the other two over. It sounded lame to her ears, though.

As she sat down, though, Kyouko surprised her by replying:

*I\'m sorry, Mami. I didn\'t mean that. Forget I said anything.*

Mami blinked in surprise. Kyouko rarely showed contrition when criticizing others, yet here she was apologizing. Come to think of it, her lack of relationships was an easy target, but Kyouko and Yuma never made fun of it. Was it some weird kind of respect? And why had Kyouko\'s comment made her hesitate?

*Don\'t worry about it,* Mami responded. *I\'m not insulted.*

Were this a true gathering, with the three of them in actual physical proximity, Mami would have shown a lot more gusto, gushing pride as they inspected her dishes and ate them greedily. As it was, this was a virtuality, the food was not real, and Mami hadn\'t even pretended to cook any of it---it would have been very extravagant of them to run a full‐detail molecular‐level simulation for something like this, but with any less detail, there was no noticeable distinction between Mami\'s superior‐in‐reality cooking and the---admittedly damn good---simulated food Mami had tried before. They could have artificially stimulated their pleasure centers to enhance their perception of the food, but none of them wanted to do that, not to mention they would have been getting close to breaching Governance restrictions on simulation parameters, even for military personnel.

So they sat at Homura\'s oversized dining table, large specifically for the purpose of hosting gatherings such as this, and \"got to eating.\" Both ends of the long table were left empty, one end for Homura\'s---and now Kyouko\'s---mysterious Goddess, the other for a friend who depressed them with her absence.

\"We haven\'t done this for real in years now,\" Yuma complained, stirring pieces of chicken in with her rice. \"I wish this war would get easier so you could come home more, Mami‐nee‐san.\"

\"Well, if you would just leave Earth for once in your life, we could do something like this on the Zhukov or wherever you prefer,\" Mami pointed out, gesturing at Yuma with her chopsticks. \"Really, it\'s childish.\"

\"You know why I don\'t,\" Yuma said, pouting. \"Don\'t take advantage of this form to make fun of me.\"

\"I still say you\'re worried about what would happen if you weren\'t next to your machines,\" Kyouko said, artfully managing to time her words in between chugs of miso soup. \"Is it really that bad to suffer some tiny routing delay? MG will live without you, I\'m sure.\"

\"Eeeeh, it\'s this conversation again,\" Yuma said, drawing the \"eh\" out into a sound of exasperated annoyance.

She made a reaching motion for some fish at the far side of the table, clearly too small to reach it. Mami picked the dish up and handed it to her.

\"I still remember when MG was just a fresh‐faced kid,\" Kyouko said, sounding deliberately wistful, \"and then she got warped by being around you all the time.\"

\"Oh, come off it,\" Yuma said. \"She\'s a perfectly well‐adjusted AI, and you know that.\"

She chewed some of her fish thoughtfully, as there was a long moment of silence.

\"Let\'s talk about some business,\" she said, finally. \"I know it\'s not the best time, but...\"

She looked around for agreement.

\"I suppose,\" Mami said, \"though I had hoped to avoid it. This is a social gathering, after all.\"

Kyouko shrugged.

\"I don\'t think there\'s anything better to talk about, unless you\'ve got some leads on Homura,\" Kyouko said.

Obviously Mami didn\'t, so she didn\'t respond.

Yuma cleared her throat for effect. It was strange coming from someone so small.

\"So regarding your budding protégé,\" Yuma began. \"I went ahead and had someone interview her schoolmate, Simona del Mago, under the guise of correcting government records. She couldn\'t give a reason for why the wrong parents were listed for two of her schools, except that in the cases where the listing was wrong, the incorrectly inserted individuals were friends of her parents. We actually knew that already, so it checks out, and in any case the telepath didn\'t think she was lying. Genetic tests confirmed paternity.\"

\"So nothing, then?\" Kyouko asked, forced to be brief by the fact that she was actively stuffing chilled noodles into her mouth.

\"Almost nothing,\" Yuma answered. \"But the telepath doesn\'t quite think so. She says the girl feels like she has telepath‐resistance training. It\'s---\"

Kyouko coughed on her noodles, spraying food in front of her in a rather ugly fashion, before the food in question automatically deleted itself, eliminating the spray, plate of chilled noodles, and whatever was in Kyouko\'s illusory windpipe. A moment later the plate rematerialized in front of her, with a fresh set of noodles.

\"Seriously?\" she asked, wiping at her mouth with a napkin even though there was nothing there to actually wipe. \"How reliable is this?\"

\"Not very,\" Yuma said, smiling slightly at Kyouko\'s behavior. \"For a non‐magical girl, complete telepath resistance is unheard of. Good training can instill the mental discipline necessary to avoid leaking information under interrogation, but the telepath will still know if you\'re lying or holding information back. In the past, we rarely bothered---no one can be vigilant 24/7, so the telepath would always get the information anyway, if they just waited in the vicinity long enough. My agent can\'t detect that she\'s holding anything back, and that would ordinarily be the end of it, but she tells me she can\'t shake the feeling she\'s being misled somehow. I don\'t know whether to believe her.\"

\"So what exactly does this mean?\" Mami asked, no longer bothering with her pointless food.

\"I have no idea,\" Yuma admitted. \"I\'ve told the agent to follow her for now, and we\'re continuing to dig into her family background, but nothing of note has been found. Sometimes telepaths make mistakes. It\'s rare, but it happens.\"

\"There are a lot of coincidences stacking up on all of this,\" Mami said, eyes shaded. \"Take this recent attack on the convoy carrying Shizuki‐san.\"

She paused to see if they knew what she was talking about. Kyouko nodded instantly, but Yuma was obliged to pause and stare off into space for a moment, before finally indicating that she understood.

\"Post‐battle analysis indicates that they clearly thought they were attacking something of unusual importance,\" Mami said. \"Those fighters were pushing well outside their usual operating range---they would have had to perform multiple jumps to make it, and they don\'t usually do that, because our deep space scanners are good enough to make them pay more often than not, given how long they\'re stuck in blink malaise at the end of every jump. In terms of weapons and shielding, they were stripped down to make the trip, which made them easier to destroy. The cost‐benefit of it doesn\'t make any sense, unless that one transport was carrying something very important.\"

\"A transport with eight magical girls on board could be worth it,\" Yuma pointed out. \"It was what, seven fighters? We\'re worth more than a fighter each, I think.\"

\"Only if they knew they were there,\" Mami said. \"Our convoy patterns are deliberately designed to make that kind of raid on average very cost‐ineffective. Among other things, the navigational specifics of these trips are not laid out until the last moment, so even if they got their hands on our transport data somehow, they should only have information for a very short time‐window. In that case, why not attack more than one transport? Why only one?\"

\"Maybe they\'re trying out something new,\" Kyouko suggested.

\"Maybe,\" Mami said. \"But the military AIs don\'t like it at all. The alert level for military shipping in the sector has already been raised. Another thing---\"

She shifted in her chair, pushing her food slightly aside.

\"The radiation attack by the last fighter was tactically very irresponsible,\" she said. \"It certainly wasn\'t pleasant for anyone involved, but the pilot and its AI couldn\'t possibly have expected that it would actually kill any of them. Not with the ship relatively intact, and all of them still alive and undamaged. If any of them had had sufficient training, it wouldn\'t have even managed as much as it did. The fighter should have cut losses and run. Why try a suicide run? The squid love suicide runs, but only when it makes sense. Not like this, even if its chances of escaping Human space weren\'t great. The cost‐benefit would only balance if it thought it had a distant chance at taking out something like a battlecruiser. Eight magical girls, a transport, and a few passengers and cargo do not equal a battlecruiser.\"

There was an extended silence as they thought about it, and Mami realized that she had perhaps spoken too earnestly.

\"Not that I\'m suggesting a connection between this and the demon attack,\" Mami said. \"That would be crazily far‐fetched.\"

\"We know you\'re not,\" Kyouko said, meeting her eyes. \"You\'re right, though. This girl is more of a handful than I expected.\"

\"I don\'t think we\'ve seen the end of it, either,\" Mami said. \"Not with a wish like hers.\"

The others nodded, without bothering to ask what the wish was. The privacy of wishes was strongly respected, as it always had been.

\"I guess I might as well add that we investigated further into Director Valentin,\" Yuma said, swirling a drink in her hand. \"But I don\'t have anything to report. Everything checks out. Even telepathic surveillance has returned nothing so far.\"

She paused, and when no one said anything, continued:

\"I\'ve thought about the logistics of it a bit more, and while it\'s certainly possible that the supersaturated grief cubes could have been generated in a residential area, there would be a lot of risk of accidental spillage if that were done. It would be much easier to do something like that in a specialized facility like Prometheus or, actually, Zeus. The Zeus Research Institute doesn\'t have the Joanne Valentin connection, but they do a lot more on the purely magical side of things. Enchantment, power development, magical quantification, things like that. Except for the Valentin thing, they\'d be a more logical suspect, and they do go through a lot more grief cubes. Of course, being that this is Mitakihara City we\'re talking about, there are literally dozens of places where it\'d be at least reasonable to do, and any magical girl could do it in their home if they knew how and weren\'t worried about screwing it up and unleashing demons everywhere.\"

\"I\'m a bit bothered that I\'m literally right in between those two places and still don\'t know that much about what they do,\" Kyouko said, looking thoughtful.

\"You should pay more attention,\" Yuma rebuked.

\"To be frank, I never thought it\'d matter much to me,\" Mami said. "As long as the technology keeps coming in, I have many other things to worry about.\"

Instead of continued speculation, there was a long moment of silence that ended only when Kyouko went back to her food, poking at some tempura with her chopsticks.

\"So how much can you tell us about how the war is going, Mami?\" she asked, casually. \"I don\'t keep up as much as I should.\"

Mami sucked in a breath, though Machina\'s timely intervention prevented the action from actually manifesting within the virtuality.

\"To be honest, not much right now,\" Mami said, reflexively sipping at a cup of tea. \"Strategically, the situation is the same as always, but the Euphratic Incursion, as you know, has serious downside potentialities. Those have started to seem more probable recently.\"

\"So it\'s bad, huh?\" Kyouko asked, watching her with an unreadable expression. \"You don\'t start pulling out the lingo unless you\'re nervous.\"

\"I\'m not nervous,\" Mami said.

She *was* nervous. The wormhole stabilizer was still a top‐grade secret, one that she didn\'t want to reveal until she had to. Things had not gone well recently. The battle over the system\'s twin worlds was still the same grinding attrition as ever, and, as expected, the fleet just didn\'t have enough resources to get at the moon, not without critically weakening defenses elsewhere---not even immediately after the failed raid, when alien defenses were still relatively weak. It was a conundrum whose importance could not be overstated. She had to solve it---but she hadn\'t, not yet.

\"You *are* nervous,\" Kyouko insisted. \"Something is going on, isn\'t it?\"

They locked eyes, and though Kyouko\'s expression was carefully serious, Mami thought she sensed something further. Deceit, perhaps. The operational security on fleet activity in the Euphratic sector was as tight as ever, but she couldn\'t easily rule out Kyouko\'s Cult smuggling information out. They seemed capable of something like that. And while the only part of Governance that was supposed to know the details was Military Affairs, Yuma was awfully good at getting information she wasn\'t supposed to have.

Still, Mami couldn\'t just say the truth out loud. In fact, she had a duty not to.

\"Hmm,\" Yuma interrupted thoughtfully. \"You know, I could go for some of that cake. If we keep carrying on like this, we\'re going to run out of time. Mami is on a schedule.\"

*Thank you!* Mami thought to herself, deciding not to worry about how much the others might or might not know.

\"I\'m not done,\" Kyouko said grouchily, grudgingly accepting the topic change. She took a moment to shovel some of her remaining food into her mouth.

\"It\'s not real food, nee‐chan,\" Yuma said. \"Just *make* yourself full.\"

Kyouko grunted, making a show of being annoyed.

\"Fine,\" she said, pushing herself away from the table dramatically.

Mami got up to get the cake out of the kitchen, leaving the others to start cleaning up. There was no particular reason she couldn\'t just clap like a magician and make it appear on the table, but she liked to include a certain amount of realism in this. The whole point of having an immersive virtuality was to try and replicate the real thing, not shortcut your way through. Besides, it would be fun cutting the thing.

When she walked back out to the dining table with cake, though, the table was devoid of food, containing only some dessert plates and utensils.

\"I told you,\" Mami complained, peeved. \"You have to---\"

\"Cut us some slack, Mami,\" Kyouko said, hitching her arm up on "Homura\'s\" chair like the delinquent she was. \"It\'s just not fun cleaning up food for no reason. Besides, there was a ton left. We wouldn\'t have had anywhere to put it. And you know, I just thought, since we\'re talking about the Goddess\'s birthday here, I didn\'t want to waste too much time...\"

Kyouko fidgeted slightly.

\"Well, okay then,\" Mami said, sighing good‐naturedly, setting the cake down on the table. \"Let\'s do this.\"

She sat down, and Yuma stretched over the table to stick the single candle into the cake. It was one of those fancy flame manipulation candles, the kind that spelled out in fire how old the individual in question was. In this case, the candle generated an infinity symbol, a virtual replica of the version that had been special‐ordered by Kyouko a long time ago, partly as a joke. It had seemed to both amuse and depress Homura, depending on her mood.

Kyouko stood up dramatically, thrusting a finger expressively at the tip of the candle. A moment later, it flared to life, fire forming a double loop.

\"It\'s a lot more impressive when you do it for real,\" Yuma said, managing to insert some childish disappointment into her voice, lilting the phrase \"for real\".

\"Yeah,\" Kyouko agreed, sounding disappointed too. \"I still can\'t believe I put so much work into learning a party trick.\"

\"Well, you used to be quite the party girl,\" Mami commented, without condemnation. \"Doing it without a transformation is pretty impressive. But if you wasted that much effort learning a skill that far out of your skillset, you might as well expand it into something more useful.\"

\"Who says I haven\'t?\" Kyouko said absently, feeling around in her pockets for something. \"And despite all the time I wasted on it, it was still easier than I thought it would be. An affinity for fire, maybe. Who knows?\"

Finally realizing what was wrong, Kyouko summoned a stick of pocky into her hand and stuck it into her mouth to chew on. She hadn\'t thought to load her clothes with food in the simulation.

\"Well, you should show me sometime, then,\" Mami said. \"Just don\'t go Hinata Aina on me.\"

Yuma sat back down in her chair.

\"Eh, we\'ve had this conversation before too,\" she complained. \"You still haven\'t ever shown her, Kyouko‐nee‐chan. Repeating the same topics is boring.\"

Mami and Kyouko glanced at each other.

\"I like to think of it as tradition,\" Mami said.

Yuma rolled her eyes as Mami sat down. They looked at Kyouko, who was still standing, to say something.

This part was always awkward.

Kyouko cleared her throat.

\"Well, like always, I\'ll spare you the speech,\" she said. \"I\'ve done plenty of speeches today. Let\'s just enjoy ourselves.\"

Then, without waiting for the other two to get ready, she immediately started singing \"Happy Birthday\", forcing Mami and Yuma to insert themselves randomly into the middle of the song. Strictly speaking, it was a version of Happy Birthday modified to account for the fact that Homura wouldn\'t tell them the name of the girl in question, and to compensate for the fact that \"Happy birthday, dear Goddess.\" sounded awkward to everyone. Each of them now had enough implanted technology to sing perfectly on‐key, even if not quite at the same level as a professional singer. They had tried that one year, but somehow the normal unenhanced version, slightly discordant and mistimed, seemed more appropriate.

Afterward, Mami picked up the cake knife and carefully sliced the strawberry and cream cake into five evenly‐sized pieces, ensuring expertly that the fruit was split fairly. Once, at the very beginning of her magical girl career, she wouldn\'t have been so bold as to eat one‐fifth* of a cake. She had feared weight gain just as much as everyone of her age group at the time. Then later they had realized that their bodies kept themselves at optimum condition regardless, and something as mundane as body fat could be easily molded with magic. Though Mami generally disapproved of unnecessary body modification, she... had to admit to having tried a few things occasionally. Everyone did, at some point.

Anyway, eating cake by the truckload had become a fairly common thing for them, and eventually they had even stopped acting delicately embarrassed about it---though of course Kyouko had never bothered to do that.

She handed out the cake, piece by piece, with Kyouko of course going first. She was glad to see that Kyouko, who might have been trying to rile her up earlier, wasn\'t going so far as to shove the cake into her mouth with her bare hands, as she had been wont to do when she had first moved in with Mami. It had taken a lot of training to get her to switch to the fork and knife, even if Kyouko was still a little impatient about it.

Finally, she gave the last piece to herself and sat down.

\"Let\'s eat,\" she said, making the traditional gesture of thanks. "*Itadakimasu.*\"

The others repeated the phrase, which had otherwise fallen out of use after the Unification Wars.

Kyouko tore through her cake, hunched over slightly, occasionally glancing at the empty chair that represented the Goddess. Yuma and Mami were chatting about maybe inviting MG next time---Yuma was pushing the notion, Mami was less keen, though apparently Machina thought it was a good idea---but Kyouko wasn\'t really listening. Sometimes, she felt a little strange just unashamedly pigging out on cake and relaxing, without much reference to the girl whose birthday it was. She always remembered, though, what Homura had said, that the Goddess would have far preferred this to anything more somber.

At times like this, she remembered, too, Homura\'s hints that they too had once known the Goddess, and forgotten.

What kind of girl had she been? How had Kyouko treated her? What had they thought of each other?

Sometimes, in these last two decades, she would stare at the empty chair, feeling as if she were on the verge of remembering. The feeling would get so strong that she would stop eating, stop doing anything else, just *stare,* wracking her mind trying to recover the memory that was *right there*---but then the feeling would fade, and she would find herself again staring at a meaningless chair, wondering if she had really been about to remember something, or if it had been merely a product of imagination and faith.

Mami and Yuma, certainly, never seemed to notice anything untoward, looking at her oddly whenever she had these moments.

Other times, though, she swore she saw Mami looking at the chair too, with a strange look on her face.

Kyouko shook her head at herself, then sighed.

*Homura, where are you?* she thought, desperately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Yes, mama, I\'m doing fine,*\" Ryouko said, reclining on her bed and amusing herself by placing CubeBot on her belly and letting it crawl its way back towards the table. On the table at the head of the bed, her soul gem lay charging next to a couple of grief cubes. It seemed like a lifetime since she had last participated in a phone call, that familiar rhythm of back‐and‐forth transmitted thoughts.

\"*Are you sure?*\" her mother responded, narrowing her eyes at Ryouko, conveying a sense of overbearingness through the video feed. Her mother had insisted on the video this time, exploiting her MG status for the extra interstellar bandwidth allotment. It was difficult to properly hold a video call without some sort of fixed spot to glare at, so most people had the video playing at a specific physical location in their field of view. Ryouko had it hovering over her head, between her eyes and the ceiling.

\"*They\'re not overworking you, are they?*\" the woman asked. \"*Have they made you do any fighting yet?*\"

Ryouko thought about it. If she was asking, then...

\"*Not yet,*\" Ryouko lied. \"*But there\'s a large simulation part of the training, you know. It\'s,* um---\"

\"*Oh right, I forgot,*\" her mother interrupted.

Ryouko expected the woman to keep talking, but instead there was a long pause, during which her mother seemed to look off into the distance, thinking about something.

\"*So, uh, how was that?*\" her mother asked.

\"*It... wasn\'t that bad,*\" Ryouko thought, realizing it was difficult to talk about to someone who hadn\'t been in one, especially since she wasn\'t sure how much her mother knew about it. If her mother didn\'t know much, Ryouko didn\'t want to enlighten her by going into too much detail. Her mother didn\'t need to know.

\"*I got a lot of,* uh, *experience,*\" she settled on saying, knowing it wasn\'t a great explanation.

\"*Oh well, that\'s good, I guess,*\" her mother said, voice strangely detached.

Again, Ryouko expected her mother to keep talking, but no questions arrived. She had the unsettling feeling they were both trying to avoid saying too much. Her mother seemed again to be looking away from the "screen\".

\"*I don\'t know if you heard,*\" her mother said, finally. \"*But your grandfather was reassigned to a specialist posting, so he\'s receiving training to work in a field hospital. I knew he\'d test well. He was a pretty good doctor, back in the day. And, as you probably know, doctors with experience treating actual damage are rare nowadays. Though I guess I\'m probably a biased source, especially given that I was a child for a large part of it. Well, I suppose---*\"

\"*Ah yeah, I was glad to hear that,*\" Ryouko interrupted, before her mother could go off on some long tangent.

\"*Let\'s just hope he can stay out of trouble,*\" her mother said, a moment later.

Another pause, but this time it was a natural conversational pause.

\"*Anyway, make any friends yet?*\" her mother asked. \"*Nana told me that\'s pretty common during training, which I guess makes sense. Sounds weird to me, but...*\"

\"*Oh, yes,*\" Ryouko said. \"*She\'s right. One of them is from near Mitakihara. I\'ll send pictures later. I don\'t think we\'ll be staying together, though.*\"

\"*I see. Well, it\'s always like that. Obviously it\'s good to form good working relationships with those you work with, but the military goes out of its way to encourage long‐distance connections. It\'s healthy, you know. Feels strange saying it like that when my daughter is involved, though.*\"

*Indeed,* Clarisse thought, startling Ryouko into almost sitting up. That kind of thing is built right into my programming.*

*Did mama hear you say that?* Ryouko thought, a little desperately.

*No,* Clarisse thought. *I thought about it, though.*

*Please don\'t,* Ryouko thought.

\"*Did something happen?*\" her mother asked, noting her obvious sudden surprise.

\"*Yeah, I\'m here. A friend showed up.*\"

\"*Ah, well, if it\'s a bad time, you can call me later.*\"

\"*No, no,*\" Ryouko denied. \"*Not at all.*\"

Her mother looked down for a moment, seeming to think.

\"*Hmm, well... I\'m not really sure how to talk about this, but, uh...*\"

There was a long pause, during which her mother seemed almost embarrassed, clasping her hands meaninglessly. Ryouko wondered what it could possibly be.

\"*Well, I\'ll just say it directly,*\" her mother finally said, making eye contact. \"*The fact of the matter is, now that you\'ve gone against my advice and contracted, there is a now a metaphorical line of suitors at your door, because of all the family connections. Except, you know, we\'re mostly getting things from other parents. Matchmaking, basically.*\"

Her mother paused, putting a finger to her mouth thoughtfully, noting Ryouko\'s horrified expression.

\"*Well, for the future, given your age, obviously,*\" the woman continued, eyes dancing around nervously. \"*Your grandfather says it happened to him too, for me and, uh, my sister, back in the day, but the fact that your grandmother didn\'t know made it hard, plus the whole family estrangement thing. Oh, wow, I don\'t want to overwhelm you, but I felt you should know. I mean, if you just want some options, it\'s available. And you know, I\'ve never wanted to pry, but there\'s alternative orientation options too. Obviously, this kind of thing is rather quaint, and you can wait as long as you want---*\"

*Ryouko, you should say something,* Clarisse prompted.

Ryouko had merely been listening quietly, aghast, as her mother started to ramble.

*Say what?* she asked, finally.

*Anything! Or tell her you already got some direct messages and you\'ll take care of it,* Clarisse thought. *Or something like that. Look, I could do it for you. I can fake it, but I really think you should---*

\"*Mama! I know!*\" Ryouko interjected. \"*I already got two messages directly. I\'ll take care of it.*\"

Her mother stopped talking.

\"*Really? I never got any while I was contracted. Hmm. Maybe it\'s the Shizuki thing. Wonder if Nana ever got any? I never thought to ask...*\"

There was another pause.

\"*You know,*\" her mother said. \"*It kind of makes sense. Kuroi and Shizuki are both notable names, but when I met your father, the families were not pleased. Fortunately for you, neither of us have ever really listened to those old crones, but maybe there just aren\'t that many Shizuki‐Kuroi marriages.*\"

\"*I see,*\" Ryouko said, not really sure what else to say.

\"*Anyway, obviously I\'m once again a biased party, but you\'re too young,*\" her mother said, making an obvious attempt to look her in the eye. \"*And just for the future, you should really think about this kind of thing hard before committing to anything. Forever is a long time, believe me. Though I do suppose time‐limited marriages are more popular nowadays---*\"

\"*I know, mama, I know. I\'m not interested right now. But thanks for telling me.*\"

\"*I do wonder about you sometimes. But, oh well. Don\'t forget to call again soon. I imagine it\'d be hard for us to call you, since who knows how the scheduling works. Oh, and we\'d love to visit. They do that for magical girls like you, you know. You can put in a word. I haven\'t been off‐planet in a long time---*\"

\"*You\'ve been off‐planet?*\" Ryouko asked, surprised.

\"*Of course I have,*\" her mother said. \"*It was more common before the war started. Scientific conferences, things like that. They still do it occasionally. I\'m still trying to get into another one, but nowadays they try to make us get a VR exemption instead.*\"

\"*You never told me this!*\" Ryouko said, accusingly.

\"*You never asked?*\" Her mother turned it into a question, looking at her strangely. \"*I guess I just never managed to mention it. Well, uh, anyway, I sort of have to go. See you for now.*\"

The woman waved.

\"*See you,*\" Ryouko said, waving back.

With a quiet artificial click, the call ended.

*For the record, it\'s actually four messages now,* Clarisse thought. *I just haven\'t mentioned the topic to you again. And was it really wise not to tell your mother about the incident with the fighters?*

*I don\'t want to scare her,* Ryouko thought.

*I suppose,* Clarisse thought.

*Let\'s see if I can dial up Chiaki then,* Ryouko thought.

*I don\'t think you have time anymore,* Clarisse thought.

Ryouko checked her chronometer. Clarisse was right. She had just started free time---a *day‐long* free time---but had agreed to meet with Asami to explore the town.

*Alright,* she thought, getting up. *I guess I can send her a message instead.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"So we came all the way out here to see a game of---\"

*Basketball,* Clarisse fed her, before she even had time to fail to remember the word.

\"Basket... ball?\" she repeated, sounding out the unfamiliar combination of words.

\"Yes,\" Asami said, making a face in the general direction of the playing area---specifically, that vacuous‐looking expression people had when trying to zoom in on something distant with their optical implants. "Apparently it\'s a prewar game, one of those that stopped working well after everyone got implants. Someone redesigned the rules and managed to make it popular again, but it hasn\'t caught on again on Earth.\"

Ryouko looked around her. The building they were in was huge, and seemed to be purpose‐built, with the playing court in the middle surrounded by an ocean of seats, with a transparent roof above. Besides that, it seemed as if a staggering number of people were crammed into the building, which positively buzzed with activity: the quiet roar of countless people talking, the people moving in and out of their seats, the server robots traveling up and down the aisles to deliver snacks and food.

For the first time since she had left Earth, Ryouko felt cramped.

\"You weren\'t kidding about the popularity,\" Ryouko said, turning to look at Asami.

\"Hey, don\'t look at me,\" Asami said. \"I\'m just doing what the tourist guide recommended. It\'s a very colonial sport, and the, uh, Acheron Devils are supposed to be pretty good. Supposed to be a good two‐person activity.\"

Ryouko, who hadn\'t realized that she had accidentally made a skeptical face, quickly corrected her expression.

\"Oh, no, I was just, um, wondering why they don\'t just have more people watch from home instead of building this giant building just to accommodate all this,\" she said awkwardly. \"I mean, look at how small that, uh, court is in the middle of this building. It\'s tiny!\"

Asami shrugged.

\"I guess they have more space to do this kind of thing?\" she said.

\"They must do something else with this place when they\'re not playing these games, right?\" Ryouko asked. \"It\'d be such a waste otherwise. Look at how many people this seats!\"

She gestured broadly, at the crowds of people that surrounded them. Indeed, she didn\'t turn her whole body to make the gesture, as she might have, because she would have smacked her hand into one of the people around them. In the distance, a dirigible floated over the building, advertising custom hair enhancements. The glaringly bright lights shone down on a crowd full of people wearing red uniforms. In the distance, some of them were attempting---and failing---to do some sort of coordinated arm wave. She honestly didn\'t know what to make of it.

\"I don\'t know,\" Asami said, shrugging again.

There was a brief silence while Asami consulted an internal reference and Clarisse fed Ryouko the answer.

\"Wow,\" Ryouko said. \"I guess---I guess they really do have a lot of space out here. Did you notice how big the rooms were?\"

\"Yeah,\" Asami agreed. \"I don\'t know who could possibly have enough stuff to fill it all.\"

They both lapsed into silence, as Ryouko tried to think up a new topic worth discussing, but was spared that trial by a sudden shift in attention by the crowds of people around them, as well as the lights around them dimming. The game was starting, it seemed.

Truth be told, she had never been a big fan of sports. Neither of her parents had ever shown much interest, and as a child she had never really been too impressed by the soccer stars power‐dashing their way up and down the field. There were sports clubs at her school, sure, and she had even participated in a few, but all had failed to spark her interest. To her, it seemed like just another way for her peers to feel like they were accomplishing something important, when actually they were accomplishing nothing.

Which wasn\'t to say she hadn\'t been engaged during the actual games. She had; she hated losing, and always tried her hardest to win, which was why it had distressed her that her efforts were often unsuccessful. She felt terrible losing, and on those occasions where her side did win, she would experience a burst of satisfaction, followed by a sinking emptiness as she realized that, on the large scale, none of it had counted for anything.

Now, though, as she watched players struggle mightily to get a large round ball through their opponents\' goal, she felt something new. For the first time, instead of being struck by the pointlessness of what she was seeing, she felt strangely convinced that it was too *easy.* An athlete, powered by specialized implants, would jump absurdly high into the air to snag the ball out of the air and instead of being impressed, she simply felt bored. Players executed complicated plays, zipping the ball back and forth almost too fast for a normal human to see, and she couldn\'t help think that the players seemed sluggish and tired.

*I can do all of that easily,* she realized suddenly. *That\'s why I\'m not impressed.*

*Probably,* Clarisse thought, even though she hadn\'t been directly addressed. *It\'s actually a common phenomenon among you magical girls. But even so, most girls are at least capable of enjoying yourselves. You\'re a strange mistress.*

*Please don\'t call me mistress,* Ryouko thought, a moment later. *It makes me feel strange.*

And, as Clarisse said, Asami appeared to be enjoying herself moderately, carefully tracking the movements of the ball across the court, and occasionally joining the crowd in cheers. Seeing this, Ryouko swallowed her ennui as best she could and tried to stay engaged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I\'m sorry about that,\" Asami said suddenly, as they reached the street corner where they had arranged to be picked up.

\"About what?\" Ryouko asked, turning her head to look at the other girl.

Acheron rotated only a little slower than Earth, meaning they had passed enough time that it was already nearly pitch‐black. The remaining lights of the city served to cast a slight glow to the smoky sky. Nakihara Asami\'s face seemed buried in the gloom, carrying that eerie cast Ryouko had learned to associate with her preternatural night vision. The girl\'s ponytail shifted slightly.

\"I know you didn\'t really enjoy it,\" Asami said, eyes downcast. "It\'s my fault. I was the one who insisted we try to explore alone. I shouldn\'t have placed my faith in an online source.\"

Ryouko watched the other girl\'s expression. Something was unusual here, but she couldn\'t quite place it.

\"Don\'t worry about it,\" she said, choosing not to pointlessly deny her lack of interest. \"I should have said something. I didn\'t want to make you change plans just for me. Besides, it wasn\'t that bad. I had fun.\"

In the awkward silence that ensued, Ryouko reflected that, indeed, it had been a little unusual of Asami to insist on exploring alone, but that it had still been a good idea. Ryouko wasn\'t going to let her own strange behavior ruin this night.

\"Hey, come on,\" she said. \"Don\'t be so gloomy. We should be having fun. Weren\'t we supposed to go to the hot springs next?\"

Asami nodded, as the shuttle they had called pulled up in front of them.

\"Yeah,\" she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They were uncharacteristically quiet during the drive over, Ryouko looking out the window, watching the short buildings of the town---she still didn\'t think of it as a city---pass by. There were a surprising number of religious facilities here, compared to Earth, but according to Clarisse that was expected. Other than that, there wasn\'t much to look at; she was already getting used to this planet.

She frowned slightly. Here she was, exploring a colony world, and it wasn\'t much more dynamic than puttering around on Earth. It wasn\'t supposed to be like this.

*That\'s because I\'m in a city again. Not exploring the wilderness, not flying a starship, just... visiting places. There isn\'t even that much Capitalism; we get free shuttles, food, and board from the military, and way more money than we can use. It takes some of the impact out of it. And the advertisements get old once you\'ve seen fifty of them.*

She watched the horizon for a moment longer. Generally speaking, the night sky here didn\'t look that different from Earth, except that with the atmospheric dust, stars were considerably harder to see. There was also no comforting moon hanging in the sky.

Of course, where she had lived on Earth, the tubes blocked most of the sky, though she had always made the best of it she could with her telescope, working her optical implants to improve the contrast of the sky. On the first night here, she had set up her telescope and taken a look. The constellations were different, of course, but she had never placed much stock in those meaningless, Earth‐specific shapes. Far more important were the worlds circling those stars, and who lived there. She supposed the constellations were useful for historical reasons, though, as an explanation for the naming of some stars.

*Clarisse,* she thought. *I concede. You\'re better at this than I am. Why is Asami behaving so strangely?*

*I don\'t believe she\'s really that depressed,* Clarisse thought. *I believe she\'s thinking about something.*

*Do you have any idea what?*

There was a distinct pause, which Ryouko attributed to Clarisse thinking about the problem.

*Perhaps you will find out soon,* the device replied.

The buildings outside her window thinned out shockingly fast, and she began to see a lot more of the rocky landscape, with a smattering of shriveled‐looking plants clinging to the surface. She began to peer out more carefully. A part of her wanted to stop the vehicle to go out and take a look, but that would have been obviously inappropriate. Eventually, they began obviously ascending, the vegetation becoming denser, so that the ground no longer looked quite so much like a wasteland---though she still wouldn\'t call it lush by any stretch. With a start, Ryouko realized that the last time she had been on a mountain of any sort had been nearly ten years ago, on a class trip to Mt. Fuji.

She looked back over her shoulder, at the town they had just left, nestled in a volcanic valley. It looked different than the cities she had visited on Earth---it seemed smaller, shorter, and altogether more compact. It looked strange.

Sooner than she expected, they were there, the shuttle exiting down a ramp onto a smaller road that quickly started to wind and twist unfamiliarly. Five minutes later, they pulled to a stop in front of a modest‐looking building which appeared to be, of all things, partially set *into* the mountainside.

Stepping off of the vehicle, Ryouko looked up at the unpromising building facade, painted in garish bright red and white. The sun seemed brighter here, though she wasn\'t sure if it was her imagination.

*The marketing daemon here wants to transmit an \"Informative Audio Introduction,\"* Clarisse thought, making the quotation marks apparent with her tone of voice. *Do you want to hear it?*

*I guess,* Ryouko thought.

She turned to say something to Asami, but the girl had her hand to her ear, signaling that she was busy with something, probably the same "Audio Introduction\". Idly, Ryouko wondered just how that particular hand‐to‐ear gesture had gotten started. It certainly didn\'t seem very efficient, having to move your arm up just to tell people you were listening to something. It would have made sense if it were just a matter of pointing at your ear, but you were actually supposed to clasp a finger over the hole, as if you were holding something in. It didn\'t make sense.

She shrugged, and headed up the steps to the glass sliding door, which slid open to reveal an eerily‐lit tunnel stretching farther inward. As they stepped into it, the walls lit up, revealing illuminated imagery of an austere Acheron landscape, devoid even of plants. Gruff‐looking holographic humans in dusty clothing looked dramatically back out at them, meeting her eye, while drones carried out mysterious duties in the background.

A pleasant feminine voice droned in Ryouko\'s head:

> The colony world of Acheron was marked for early second‐wave colonization in 2360, following extensive survey by Governance and civilian prospectors.
>
> Despite the planet\'s seeming inhospitality, its abundant sulfur deposits, bacterial life, atmospheric oxygen, and sunlight made it a promising site for specialized industrial development. Basic settlement construction and biosphere elaboration were begun immediately, culminating in the planet\'s official founding and naming in 2404. Pre‐settlement conditions were mildly unpleasant, and the name \"Acheron\" was suggested by the prospectors on site.

As the voice spoke, the walls around them transitioned gradually, first into images of robotic construction equipment and seeding planes, then into an image of the founding ceremony, which featured a couple of newly‐minted colonial bureaucrats standing around in front of a building cutting a giant ribbon with giant scissors. Among the two or three awkward‐looking suited officials stood a single woman in dusty overalls, smiling vaguely. One arm was sheathed in a partial exoskeleton, while the other had a nanomanipulator wrapped around the wrist.

*Governance: Colonial Expansion,* in avatar form, she knew, before she could think to ask.

> While industrial mining is, of course, handled primarily by automatic machinery, an enterprising mining AI named John Henry soon realized that there were other benefits that could be accrued from the volcanic mountainside.
>
> While it was initially difficult to convince more human mining workers of the value of a hot springs bath on one of the hottest colonized Human worlds, John was able to exploit existing machinery to construct the first of Acheron\'s hot spring baths, which quickly became a hit, especially after they pooled their salaries to add a second, cooled frigidarium.
>
> Outside investors were quickly brought in to tour the facilities, and soon the first of Acheron\'s true tourist attractions was up and running, with an arrangement made by the Acheron Tourist Group, LLC to purchase depleted sulfur mines from Strategic Sulfur, SOE, in a true display of the value of---

\"Hey, do you know what that means?\" Asami asked suddenly, surprising Ryouko out of her listening trance. Ryouko looked back at the girl blankly.

\"All that stuff about *LLC* and *SOE,*\" Asami said, looking at her strangely.

\"Uh, limited liability corporation,\" Ryouko said, proud of having remembered that much herself. \"And, uh, state‐owned enterprise.\"

She had pulled the second phrase from Clarisse, and she wondered why Asami hadn\'t just looked it up herself.

Then, suddenly, the tunnel ended, just as the audio terminated. It was an interesting technical feat, one Ryouko had seen before in other places: using careful holography, different images could be displayed to different people, depending on where they were in the audio track. It could presumably handle many more people than just the two of them.

The room they had arrived in, however, was deserted. It was large and cylindrical, with multiple corridors leading out from the rear of the room, behind a large hewn rock counter that was currently unmanned. Dim orange lighting emerged from alcoves carved into the wall, keeping their source hidden. Ryouko switched briefly into infrared, and was disappointed to find it was just a standard lighting fixture, if oddly colored.

Ryouko and Asami glanced at each other, each discerning that the other was somewhat put off by the complete lack of people. For a tourist attraction that had appeared bustling from the wall images, it sure wasn\'t very packed.

\"Ah, welcome!\" a voice said breathlessly. \"Sorry, I was busy with another customer.\"

A bikini‐clad woman hurried out of one of the corridors, sandaled feet clattering against floor. She narrowly avoided knocking over the racks of brochures on the counter, stopping herself just in time, then looked at them expectantly, hair dripping.

They stepped forward warily.

\"Don\'t worry, I don\'t bite,\" the woman insisted. \"Yeah, I know it\'s sort of empty, but there\'s actually plenty of people in the rooms back there. But war policies have really taken a toll on tourism around these parts. Governance wants to focus economic activity on Capital Investment; something like that. Anyway, how long will you two be staying? And, uh, are you opting for swimsuit or bare? We have some to borrow or buy, if you want.\"

\"Maybe two hours bare?\" Asami suggested, before Ryouko could say anything.

The woman looked at the two of them appraisingly for a moment.

\"Okay,\" she said. \"I\'d tell you how much it is, but, heck, you can afford it. I\'ll forward the information to your TacComps anyway, though. Not trying to rip anyone off here. Follow me.\"

A small door at the side of the counter unlocked, and they followed the woman down one of the corridors, the floor changing suddenly from polished marble to black volcanic rock. Ryouko, who had been vaguely aware of the temperature slowly rising the whole time they had walked down the tunnel, felt it spike even higher. Not without a little nervousness, she checked to make sure it was still within her acceptable temperature range.

They dove deeper into the cavern, turning left into a sub‐tunnel, before finally reaching a door carved directly into the rock. It swung open at their approach, revealing a surprisingly non‐volcanic‐looking set of changing facilities.

\"Well, luckily for you, you can easily have a whole room to yourself,\" the woman said. \"There won\'t be anyone to disturb you. Anyway, I\'ve got more customers, so uh---\"

The woman ran back the way they had come.

Ryouko and Asami watched her back as she departed.

\"Was it really necessary for her to escort us?\" Ryouko asked.

Asami shrugged, again uncharacteristically silent.

Ryouko stepped into one of the changing rooms, closing the door behind her. Now that she thought about it, it was perhaps a little strange to visit a place like this with just two people, but it did seem to be one of the city\'s touristy things...

She hesitated a moment while reaching at her shirt. Come to think of it, the last time she had visited a public bath had been back in late elementary school, with Chiaki and her parents.

*Ack, why am I hesitating?* she thought. *It\'s not like I\'ll look that bad in comparison to her. Probably.*

Still, one couldn\'t approach getting naked in front of someone with full equanimity, even if it had already happened once or twice during the training simulations. She reassured herself with that thought. At least it couldn\'t possibly be considered chilly in here.

She re‐emerged from the room quickly, but found herself waiting. When Asami finally showed herself, she seemed, if anything, even more embarrassed, especially when Ryouko instinctively gave her the once‐over.

Ryouko glanced away, stopping herself too late. She really needed to get over these self‐esteem issues.

\"Well, let\'s go see if these fabled baths are really any good,\" she said, perhaps a little too flippantly. She found herself actually blushing a little.

To her slight relief, it turned out that the hot water pool, the next room over, was not directly carved out of the rock, but was tiled with antiseptic‐laced synthetic marble, just like a normal public bath. She wasn\'t sure why it mattered to her, but it seemed more civilized, somehow.

She dipped her feet into water, gingerly, and found it surprisingly not as cringe‐worthy as she expected. With a shrug, she went ahead and put the rest of her body in, head out, of course.

*You can thank me later for the superior temperature adjustments, Clarisse said. *Though we are nearing the limits of your standard operating range, for the record.*

*I see,* Ryouko though. It actually seemed like a bit of a shame. Cringing your way into the pool seemed almost traditional, somehow.

She leaned back, absorbing the steam and heat into her skin. It was indeed pleasant, though she didn\'t think it was a good idea to be falling asleep here.

\"It\'s not bad,\" she said out loud.

\"Yeah,\" Asami said, a moment later, joining her. Her voice was subdued.

\"You know, public bathing used to be a worldwide thing,\" Ryouko said, scooting over to close the weird gap Asami had left between the two of them. \"The frigidarium they have here is totally a Roman concept. But it stopped being popular in many areas after the nineteenth century. It was a cultural thing, and later on people started being worried about sanitation. It only really came back into vogue after the Unification Wars, when there was that flood of refugees into Japan and the surrounding areas. Of course, we now know that the relative survival of the area wasn\'t a complete coincidence. So just think, if the MSY hadn\'t been founded in Mitakihara, this kind of public bathing might never have gotten popular again. If Japan had gotten seriously bombed out, it might have been gone entirely. And then where would Acheron get its tourist money?\"

Ryouko knew from experience that people didn\'t actually like her going onto random textbook‐like historical tangents. She liked to think she was better than her mother, in terms of being self‐aware about it, though she acknowledged the maternal similarity there. But now, though, she had a feeling she needed to say *something.*

She looked at Asami for a response, leaning over slightly, but the other girl was staring at the water, seemingly not listening.

Ryouko took a breath.

\"Asami‐chan?\" she asked. \"What\'s wrong? You haven\'t seemed right ever since the basketball game. It wasn\'t that bad, really! I don\'t understand why you\'re moping around like this.\"

She watched as the other girl closed her eyes, visibly swallowing.

\"It\'s embarrassing,\" Asami said. \"To admit something like this after all that we\'ve talked about...\"

\"What?\" Ryouko asked, confused.

Asami clamped her hands between her knees and swallowed again.

\"The others always made their assumptions, telling me how lucky I was to be your roommate, about all your family connections, and how I should take this chance while I have it. I always denied it, since I didn\'t think...\"

She shook her head at herself.

\"I don\'t know,\" she said, chuckling. \"I didn\'t see you as anything other than a friend at the beginning, but then I saw you fight. Do you remember, all those times you saved my life, in those simulations?\"

*Hold on!* Ryouko wanted to say, her heart starting to beat faster, unaccountably. She didn\'t understand---

\"Of course,\" she said. \"But you saved me plenty of times too. It\'s just how it is.\"

\"Not as often,\" Asami said, shaking her head. \"Do you have any idea, what you look like when you do that? What you look like when you lead? It\'s the most beautiful thing I\'ve ever seen. You look...\"

The girl swallowed one more time.

\"I don\'t know. Is this what love is? The others seem to think so. Recently, I\'ve felt so empty without you around, as if I have nothing to do, nothing worth doing. Taking a bath together like this, I feel so nervous, but am I just confusing myself? Is this real? I don\'t know.\"

Ryouko\'s eyes widened. She raised her hand weakly out of the water, then let it drop again with a quiet splash. She could feel her conception of the world rearranging abruptly, as it had when she had seen her clone in its closed vat, what felt like a lifetime ago.

*Love?* It seemed so foreign, so alien to her understanding of herself that someone would think that way of her. Those silly proposals she had gotten in the mail---those had been easy to conceptualize in terms of power and mutual benefit, in the same way one thought about the affairs of governments and militaries. This made no sense at all.

\"Do you mean that?\" she managed. \"I\'m sorry. I don\'t---\"

\"I know you don\'t understand,\" Asami said, looking her in the eye, finally. \"You\'re like that. So focused. It amazes me. I thought I was like you, but then I realized: not so much.\"

They locked eyes, Ryouko searching the other girl\'s eyes for something to hold onto, something that made sense. Why did---

*Brace yourself; she\'s about to kiss you,* Clarisse thought, her thought loud and overriding at a moment like this, even if it sounded just like Ryouko\'s own voice.

*Wha---*

And then it happened, Ryouko with eyes wide, open, and searching, Asami with eyes closed.

Ryouko hadn\'t even had time to process the sensation before the other girl pulled back.

\"I told myself I wouldn\'t leave any regrets behind,\" Asami said, eyes sidecast, voice shaky. \"I know---I know you\'ll need time to think. I\'ll leave you alone.\"

With one explosive motion, she launched herself out of the water and onto the ground above, using a good deal more strength than was necessary in her haste.

Then her bare feet padded away, leaving Ryouko reaching for her, "*Wait!*\" stillborn on her tongue.

*I...* she began, unable even to complete the thought.

*I won\'t interfere too much,* Clarisse thought. *It\'s your own decision to make. If you\'re wondering about orientation, my analysis indicates that the potential is within you, should you choose to exercise it. You\'re strange, though. Without impetus from somewhere, the thought never even crosses your mind. According to my built‐in models, that places you into a tiny minority. Also, I, uh... just really thought I should say something, as awkward as it is. Most people do not appreciate us TacComps commenting, but I figured you might need some guidance.*

Ryouko stared at the exit door a few moments longer, paralyzed by the sheer surrealism of it all. Receiving a love confession in the middle of an alien volcano, stark naked, with a voice in her head kibitzing. This was not how she had pictured her life three weeks ago.

Then she pushed herself out of the water and headed for the exit. She didn\'t know what she was going to do, but she had to do it.

*Thanks, Clarisse,* she thought. *I know you\'re trying to help.*

*The timing of this all is terrible,* Clarisse thought. *You\'ve been recalled from break. Technically, I should have told you earlier, but it was sort of not a good time.*

*Recalled? Why?*

*Not right now,* Clarisse thought.

Ryouko didn\'t argue that, instead focusing on finding the other girl immediately. It was not as if Asami could get far, with no clothes on, and there had been no time for her to dress.

She caught the other girl when she emerged from the changing room, triggering a wave of surprise and fear in the other girl\'s eyes.

\"You\'re right,\" Ryouko said, surprising herself by saying something decisively. \"I don\'t know what to say to any of that. I\'ll think about it. That\'s all I can promise. Please, I don\'t want this to ruin things, ah, between the two of us. You know what I mean.\"

Asami looked back into her eyes, eyes wavering, then nodded.

\"Somehow I knew you\'d be decisive like that,\" the girl said.

Then the girl collapsed forward, grabbing onto her shoulders. Confused at first, Ryouko realized: Asami was exhausted, emotionally. Not knowing what else to do, she patted the other girl on the head meaninglessly.

She really wished she could get some clothes on first, though.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*So why am I being recalled?* Ryouko thought, finally, as they were on the way back.

*Word just came through. You\'ve been promoted to First Lieutenant, and are skipping the rest of garrison tour. You\'re to leave immediately for the Kepler‒37 system, in the Euphratic Sector.*

*Immediately?* Ryouko thought, not sure what to comment on first. But...*

She glanced over at Asami, who was looking nervous in the other seat.

*I know. I said it was horrible timing,* Clarisse said. *But this comes from Field Marshal Tomoe herself.*

## Shifting Winds 

> ##### Statement of Purpose 
>
> Up until now, the magical girl system has been a tragedy of massive proportions. The dreams of teenage girls become a nightmare of fear, conflict, deprivation and death. This is the result of a failure of organization and cooperation, not intrinsic to the system itself. The participating teams of Mitakihara City hereby undertake to build an organization, the *Mahou Shoujo Youkai,* capable of fostering the cooperation and organization necessary to end the unnecessary pain.
>
> The MSY is founded as a mutual aid group, with five primary mandates:
>
> -   The elimination of grief cube shortages in any one time by the establishment of a grief cube pool
>
> -   The provision of a forum for the airing out, resolution, and arbitration of misunderstandings and disagreements
>
> -   The provision of effective countermeasures in the event of serious external threats or dangerous circumstances
>
> -   The distribution of non‐magical resources such as money in a manner beneficial to the group as a whole
>
> -   The distribution of team members, particularly newly contracted girls, in an optimal manner
>
> ##### Article I --- Fundamental Organization 
>
> **1. Global Meeting**
>
> Major decisions shall be made at a General Meeting, held at least once every three months, but more frequently whenever necessary. This Meeting shall have the power to issue exceptions to every part of this Charter, and may amend whenever felt necessary. At least one member of every member team must be present to constitute a quorum, and decisions require an absolute majority of present members, as well as the agreement of at least one member of each team, with the exception of certain sanctionary actions mentioned below, for which the quorum requirement may be relaxed to as little as one member per each of half the existing teams. This may be done, for instance, for failure to attend the Meeting.
>
> Chairmanship and Hosting of the next Meeting will be decided at the previous Meeting. The hosting team will organize and chair the session, charging any direct costs to the General Fund. Any member team may request an early Meeting at any time.
>
> **2. General Fund**
>
> Two joint Treasurers from different teams shall be assigned to manage a General Fund, which shall be used to finance organizational activity, as well as provide reimbursements when practicable. The Treasurers shall provide a description of organizational finances at every General Meeting, and may be replaced by the Meeting whenever desired.
>
> The founding teams commit to providing at least twenty thousand Japanese Yen (¥20,000) per member to initialize the Fund. Subsequently, teams are required to contribute at least ten thousand Japanese Yen (¥10,000) each month per member. Individual members may be required to contribute more at the discretion of the Global Meeting, particularly if the given member has access to significant outside wealth.
>
> Any contributions exceeding this amount may be used to deduct from the contributing team\'s required surplus grief cube contribution, at a rate to be considered and reset at every Meeting, depending on the state of the organization\'s current finances and grief cube stocks, but may not be used to deduct from the absolute minimum. The initial rate is set to ten thousand Japanese Yen (¥10,000) per cube.
>
> Businesses or investment ventures undertaken by the organization will be financed from the Fund, and any proceeds will return to the Fund. Every General Meeting, a monthly reimbursement amount for each team will be decided upon; this amount may exceed the contribution amount, and the amount may differ between teams, as circumstances warrant. Teams may also request emergency allotments, issued at the discretion of the Treasurers; the resolution of any resulting fiscal issues may be decided at the next Meeting.
>
> **3. Grief Cube Pool**
>
> Three Cube Keepers will be assigned to manage a Grief Cube Pool, which shall be used to insulate member teams against poor grief cube harvests. The Pool shall be kept in multiple locations, as practicality and safety permit. Every two weeks, or more frequently, teams shall submit a number of grief cubes not required to exceed the operating surplus, but otherwise not lower than an absolute minimum of one grief cube per member per week or fifty percent (50%) of their operating surplus, whichever is higher. In the event of an operating deficit, withdrawals may be made from the pool up to one grief cube per week per member. Additional withdrawal may be granted at the discretion of the Keepers, but must be discussed at the following Meeting.
>
> The Keepers shall provide a description of organizational grief cube stocks at every General Meeting, along with an account of the productivity of various teams, and may be replaced whenever desired by the Meeting. The direct purchase or selling of grief cubes to or from the Pool may be permitted, within limitations prescribed by the previous Meeting.
>
> The Incubators have agreed to perform verification of operating deficits and surpluses.
>
> ##### Article II --- Entrance or Departure of Teams 
>
> A team that wishes to enter the organization may, with majority agreement of its own members, submit an entrance request at any time. Such requests shall be taken up by a General Meeting as soon as practicable. If requested by any one member team, a disapproval vote may be held---a majority shall suffice to refuse the entrance request. Otherwise, entrance is automatic. The Meeting may also require the requesting group to provide additional resources, *i.e.* monetary instruments, grief cubes, before allowing entrance.
>
> A team may leave the organization at any time, with majority agreement of the team\'s own members. The other teams must be informed as soon as possible. Leaving the organization does not discharge outstanding debts and obligations.
>
> A team may be ejected from the organization with the agreement of four‐fifths (⅘) of the remaining total membership of the organization, with the assent of at least one member from each team except the one being ejected.
>
> ##### Article III --- Lending of Individual Team Members 
>
> Member teams may transfer or lend individuals between one another with unanimous mutual agreement, and in cases where newly contracted members have skills that would be essential to a team other than the team in her contracting area, it may be expected, depending on residency status, age, and so forth.
>
> Individuals lent or transferred to another team have a right to expect treatment comparable to that which would be expected from their own team, including training, housing, social support, and so forth. The original team may, with the assent of the individual in question, demand that the move be reversed, with arbitration by the General Meeting if the new team does not agree.
>
> ##### Article IV --- Other Resources 
>
> It is expected that member teams will share resources not already discussed, *i.e.* access to health care or transportation, in a manner that is generous, reasonable, and fair. Disputes may be arbitrated by the General Meeting, but this is hoped to be avoided.
>
> ##### Article V --- External Threats, misc. 
>
> Member teams are expected to cooperate in the utmost in the eradication or handling of any external threats and other issues that may arise.
>
> ##### Article VI --- Additional Enforcement Measures 
>
> In the event of noncooperation, failure to attend General Meetings, or willful violation of Charter stipulations and/or Meeting decisions, a Meeting may impose sanctions upon a team, with the agreement of two‐thirds (⅔) of the remaining total membership of the organization and with the assent of at least one member from every team except the one being sanctioned. These sanctions include, but are not limited to, increased monetary and grief cube contribution requirements and refusal of emergency allotments and grief cube withdrawals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko examined her reflection in the mirror. Despite Clarisse\'s assurances that her dress uniform was designed to spec, she couldn\'t help but feel that, on her, the cap was oversized, the sleeves flared out a bit too much, and the pants were too short.

*I\'m telling you, it\'s your imagination,* Clarisse thought. *You\'re just being insecure about your size again. If it really bothers you that much, you can try increasing your height later, or maybe aging a bit. The uniforms are exactly proportional.*

*That\'s very nice of you to say,* Ryouko thought, sarcastically. Really, though, no thanks.*

*Saying it to you more subtly doesn\'t seem to have had any effect, Clarisse thought dryly. *So I thought I\'d be more direct. Plus, it would be nothing to be ashamed of. Everyone tries it at least once.*

\"Hmm,\" Ryouko said out loud, as a thought occurred to her. She waved it away immediately, though. Who would she be trying to impress anyway?

*Who indeed...* she thought, before she could stop herself.

Her reflection in the mirror reshaped itself, seemingly of its own accord, simultaneously growing taller and obtaining a bit more chest development.

*Clarisse...* she warned.

*I\'m just showing you what it would be like,* Clarisse thought. *No need to get angry.*

With a thought, Ryouko reset the mirror, returning the reflection to reality. While she had to admit it looked better, she didn\'t think doing that kind of thing was the right idea. Besides, would Asami even appreciate something like that?

She clenched her teeth together for a moment.

*Tell me, Clarisse,* she thought. *What exactly is bothering me right now?*

The device made a deliberate sighing noise.

*I\'m not some sort of magic self‐understanding shortcut machine. It\'d be better for you to figure it out yourself.*

*This is more efficient,* Ryouko thought.

*I suppose.*

For a long moment, Ryouko thought Clarisse wouldn\'t continue, but finally there was another sighing noise, followed by:

*You\'re confused and not sure what to think. Humans have a natural desire to please others, and now that it\'s relevant, you find yourself considering your appearance from Asami\'s perspective. At the same time, you realize what such an effort might imply, so you try not to think about it. Indeed, at the moment, you prefer not to think about any of it at all, because of the difficulty and complexity you feel would be involved. You\'re torn between the feeling that you should probably try to communicate with Asami at some point, while being concerned about what that might imply to her. Overall, you\'re not sure what you want to imply, so no decision can be made.*

Unusually for mere conversational speech, Clarisse delivered the audio at an accelerated pace, such that Ryouko found it difficult to interrupt. Instead, at the end, she looked down at the gloves she was holding in one hand, finding something meaningless to focus on.

*That was perhaps too candid,* she thought.

*I know.*

She stood there for a moment, pulling the gloves over her hands, clenching her hands to see how they felt. Then she placed one hand on her shoulder, taking another look at the two white block arrows on her shoulder mount, white emblazoned into the bright green of the rest of her uniform. First lieutenant, the patch meant.

Ryouko sighed. It was nice that dress uniform colors for magical girls matched their costume colors, she supposed, but it\'d also be nice to wear some other color occasionally. And didn\'t the higher ranks wear something else?

She spared a look for the artificially regenerated starfield framed in the long window next to her, even more artificial than might be expected, given that she was too deep in the Zhukov to even be next to the hull. Her cabin was much larger than she had expected, but contained little in the way of decoration or furniture. There was a bed, a dresser, a nightstand, a synthesizer, panel lighting... and that was pretty much it, unless you counted the bathroom. All of it was stock‐standard, colored to resemble lightly‐colored wood.

Tapping the toes of her shoes against the carpeted floor, she tested their feel. At least the boots were spiffy: they were colored a deep black that seemed like it would match the depths of space outside.

*Thanks, though,* she thought.

Then she headed out the door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko felt self‐conscious, stepping out into the corridor fully attired as she was, and indeed the crewman she passed right outside the door did a double‐take as she passed, before saluting half‐heartedly and pointedly turning his head back around and continuing down the corridor.

*He was most likely just surprised to see an MG in uniform. It\'s not particularly common,* Clarisse thought.

*No, I\'m okay now,* Ryouko thought. *I\'ll get over it. You don\'t need to keep reassuring me.*

At least the ship was relatively sparsely populated.

She walked only a short distance further, seeking the entrance to the fast travel tunnel along the generic metal‐gray wall. Informational announcements scrolled within the apparent metal, following her as she walked. She could have had it play a news report or something similar as she walked, but at the moment she wasn\'t in the mood. The corridor was brightly lit in her immediate vicinity, but dark elsewhere, the lighting following her as she walked.

Ryouko turned abruptly, walking into the fast travel tunnel, the door sliding open just in time for her to enter.

Her body bobbled slightly in the sudden lack of gravity as she stepped forward onto the narrow platform, listing slightly off the surface with the force of her last step.

A sudden, blisteringly strong wind shoved at her from the right, accompanied by a constant roar. It wasn\'t true weightlessness---if she had tried to move, she would have been pulled back, and there was definitely something keeping her from flying away with the wind---but to her stomach, it certainly felt like it.

She had seen the FTT before, of course, when she had first arrived on the ship, and a few times after that, but it still took her breath away. Lit with a uniform eerie blue, the walls of the cylinder stretched away from her in both directions, extending so far that she could see a horizon, where the tunnel curved away from her eyes. Equipment, personnel, and drones zoomed leftward at high speed, both directly in front of her and as specks far in the distance, silhouetted in blue. Nothing in her experience, including the limited information about battlecruisers she had seen before, had prepared her for anything like it.

The FTT spanned nearly the entirety of the battlecruiser, serving as the primary transport network of the ship. With substantial energy already devoted to tremendous artificial gravity generators, the ship could easily devote some of its gravity fields to precision transportation, routing all manner of cargo through the unidirectional tunnels.

Ryouko hardly had time to dwell on the topic, as she felt her head being turned in the direction of the tunnel to decrease her cross‐sectional area. Before she had time to prepare herself, she was accelerated forward at a brutal rate, the system taking full advantage of the durability of her not‐quite Human body. Almost immediately she matched velocities with the rest of the traffic, which now appeared stationary relative to her. As she flew, a precession of doorways and larger access portals zoomed past her, leading into other areas of the ship.

She no longer felt any wind, since there was no longer any difference in speed between her and the air.

The others she had traveled with before had seemed utterly inured to the process, casually inspecting internal menus or even reading. She had felt embarrassed by how comparatively unsteady she had been. This time around, she tried to follow her progress through the ship, noting the regions of the ship as she passed them. One could get used to anything, she supposed.

And just like that, it was over, as she was decelerated equally brutally, then drifted to a stop at another narrow platform near her destination, the platform \"tugging\" her gently down to the "ground\"---or rather, what passed for ground in this section of the ship.

She had once asked Zhukov---\"Georgy\"---if the tunnels really needed to be so *fast.* The ship had merely replied that it was optimally efficient and left it at that. Clarisse had told her that, for protection reasons, the core tunnels were located near the center of the ship, and that, in case of damage, there were alternate transportation methods that included more traditional carrier drones, \"pusher\" devices that launched you on your way, or even old‐fashioned magnetized handholds and attachment points. Somehow that sounded more pleasant.

Still, though, Ryouko had to admit feeling a certain rush traveling by gravity‐assist FTT.

*Asami would love it,* she realized.

She frowned at the thought, then shook her head at herself, continuing to her destination.

This section of the ship looked no different from the section she had just departed, but she knew from a carefully‐labeled internal map that the section she was in was special indeed.

She stopped in front of a set of elaborately carved double doors, framed by subtle gold trim. In the middle were two old‐fashioned \"doorknobs\", which particularly caught her attention by the way they jutted out.

For a moment, she just stood and stared. She had never been within the command residences of the ship, though that didn\'t mean much considering she had only been here two days.

*Wooden doors for the higher officers are a matter of tradition in the Navy,* Clarisse thought. *They\'re usually imported from Earth. It\'s one of those things.*

Ryouko glanced at the \"Tomoe Mami, Field Marshal\" plaque at the right side of the door and took a breath. She wasn\'t surprised the door hadn\'t opened at her approach. An internal counter indicated that the marshal was still ETA ten minutes. Ryouko hadn\'t wanted to arrive late.

She took a moment to rub her hand on the door. It felt novel, a little rough and grainy, similar to artificial wood she saw occasionally...

Then she jumped backwards, standing up straight as the ETA dropped precipitously from ten minutes to a mere forty seconds.

*She must have cut something short to hurry over, now that I\'m here, Ryouko thought, realizing her mistake.

Standing there awkwardly, she thought over what to say in her head as the seconds ticked by.

The moment she heard footsteps behind her, Ryouko turned on her heel and bowed more deeply than was usually necessary.

\"I\'m sorry for being early,\" she began, rushing the words. \"You didn\'t have to---\"

As she moved her head back up, she found her eyes traveling up the contours of a casual black sweater.

But when she reached the top, she didn\'t find Tomoe Mami looking back down.

*Shen Xiao Long, Tomoe‐san\'s personal bodyguard,* Clarisse identified, while Ryouko was still peering in confusion.

\"Don\'t worry about it,\" the marshal Ryouko was looking for said, appearing at her bodyguard\'s side, in---this was novel---full green‐olive general staff dress uniform. \"I wasn\'t doing anything important enough I couldn\'t leave a few minutes early. We\'ll just finish earlier. Come on, let\'s step inside.\"

When Mami pulled open the door---the old‐fashioned way, with the doorknob contraption---Ryouko was briefly surprised by the lack of movement from the two bodyguards, who had arranged themselves so as to flank the exterior of the doorway. She had expected to follow the others in, but instead found herself leaving the two bodyguards behind, Mami motioning her to follow. It made sense, on reflection.

Ryouko, who had been expecting to walk into some sort of ornate admiral\'s cabin, complete with framed portraits of ancient seamen and other similar paraphernalia, instead found herself looking at the apparent interior of a large personal apartment, of the sort one might find in certain parts of Mitakihara City. In front of her was a cushy, extravagantly large bed, high and decorated in pink and yellow. This piece of furniture was flanked by a bedstand and dresser, all in the same style. At the far side of the room was a matching pink work desk, and the lush carpeting and rugs fit the décor as well. At the two sides of the room, she could see entrances to a bathroom and dining area. Peering, she thought she saw part of a kitchen as well, attached to the dining area. The only thing that ruined the effect was the window, which displayed a reprocessed version of interstellar space, rather than the city scenery that might be expected.

All in all, it appeared to be extremely similar to Mami\'s early adulthood apartment, as depicted in the movie *Akemi,* if apartments had doorways that led directly to the bedroom. Despite its cozy feel and décor, though, the room was actually rather large, as evidenced by the triangular coffee table and sofa directly to Ryouko\'s right. Instead of seeming crammed in, the table fit naturally into what would have otherwise been a large void in the layout of the room.

Ryouko realized that the room she was seeing was, of course, much more logical than the admiral\'s cabin she had been imagining. Admiral\'s cabins in movies always had a maritime flavor to them. Then again, admirals in movies were always bearded old men with gruff voices.

She stood around uncertainly for a moment. She had seen Mami disappear into the dining area, but didn\'t know if she was supposed to be following her or sitting down somewhere.

A moment later, though, the field marshal re‐emerged into the room, carrying a tray containing two slices of strawberry‐topped cream cake, a teapot, and two small teacups. Ryouko experienced a brief flashback to Atsuko Arisu\'s office, what seemed like a lifetime ago, to when the psychologist had served her the same cake. Did the personnel files really contain information about her favorite cake, or was it just some sort of coincidence? It was good cake on its own merits...

Mami set the plates and cups downs on the coffee table, then took a seat next to the table on the floor, ignoring the sofa directly behind her.

Seeing Ryouko standing there watching her stiffly, Mami gestured for Ryouko to sit, and she did so awkwardly.

\"They offered me a personal chef,\" Mami said in her native Japanese, pouring out the tea for the two of them, \"but I declined. It wouldn\'t feel right. Not that I ever have time to make my own food anymore. I have to apologize; this is all synthesized stuff, except for the tea. I have my own supply of tea leaves, and a robot to brew it. It\'s not bad. But of course your generation has lived their whole lives on synthesized stuff, so---oh I\'m just rambling now, sorry.\"

Ryouko looked back at the other girl blankly for a long moment then, too late, realized that she had should have insisted on pouring the tea, rather than let Mami do it.

\"If Sakura‐san were here, she\'d tell you to relax and let loose,\" Mami said, setting the teapot down, and looking Ryouko in the eye. \"I mean it. This used to be so much easier, so much more informal, but nowadays every girl I take on looks too scared to even breathe.\"

On cue, Ryouko let out a breath she didn\'t even know she\'d been holding.

\"Good,\" Mami said, nodding to herself and sipping at her tea, holding the cup with both hands.

\"So how are things?\" the blonde‐haired girl asked, again peering at Ryouko. \"I mean, how was training and all that? I\'ve seen the psych reports, of course, but I want to hear it for myself.\"

Ryouko blinked. This was *not* what she had been expecting, so she had no response prepared. She dug around in her mind for a response, all the while trying to remind herself that she knew Mami\'s reputation, there was no need to be scared, she was being too nervous---

\"It was fine, fine,\" Ryouko said, repeating the last word unnecessarily. \"I don\'t think it went any differently for me than for anyone else. There was the fighter attack and all that, but we lived, and the radiation trauma wasn\'t that bad. And, uh, I made friends.\"

She cringed when she mentioned \"friends\", and hoped it was only an internal cringe. Her response seemed terribly vacuous, but the marshal nodded sagely, seeming satisfied with the response.

\"You know,\" Mami said, leaning back against the chair behind her, "your leadership during that attack is the official reason for your promotion, and the reason why you\'re here.\"

*The reason I\'m here?* Ryouko thought. Truth be told, she didn\'t know why she was here, only that Mami had wanted to meet with her, and had told her to wear her dress uniform. She hadn\'t known what to expect.

\"Well, what is---\" Ryouko began hesitantly.

\"In a moment,\" Mami insisted, waving one hand at Ryouko while using the other to sip tea. \"Finish your cake first. I\'m told it\'s your favorite. I like it too.\"

Not feeling daring enough to ask who had done the telling, Ryouko nodded slightly and set about meekly doing as instructed, picking up one of the tiny forks to cut into the cake. She was glad she had finally gotten over the dysgeusia---it had made eating really strange for a while.

\"I remember when Akemi‐san first contracted,\" Mami said, holding her teacup and looking up at the ceiling wistfully. \"We invited her over for tea and cakes, and she was so shy---nothing like she was later. I was the oldest, so she and Sakura‐san both looked up to me. Later, I started to miss being the senpai, just a little. Nowadays, everyone acts the same way, though.\"

Ryouko, who had frozen with her fork halfway to her mouth, realized what she was doing and crammed the cake into her mouth.

\"I see,\" she said thoughtfully, trying to chew her food at the same time.

Something was off about Mami\'s Japanese, something Ryouko only noticed now, in this ostensibly casual conversation. The accent, the word choice---it reminded her of her grandfather, a little, only more intrinsic somehow. It was almost as if the marshal were speaking a different dialect entirely, but it sounded like nothing Ryouko recognized.

\"Just look where we are now,\" Mami continued. \"All those years ago, we couldn\'t have even imagined it. We used to be girls too, but none of us ever got to finish our childhoods or live normal lives. Others did later, but not us. But, I suppose after hearing your wish, I can\'t say you didn\'t ask for it.\"

Ryouko, who had been drinking some of her tea, barely suppressed a jerk of surprise at her sudden inclusion into the conversation.

She coughed slightly, setting down the cup and looking at the other girl\'s face for a continuation, but Mami did not return her look, seeming to focus instead on eating her own cake. Unsure of what to say, Ryouko eventually looked back down and did the same.

Eventually, she finished her cake, setting the fork down with a slight clatter. She hadn\'t relished it as much as she might have.

\"I\'m sorry,\" Mami said, with a slight smile. \"I don\'t know what came over me. Now that I think about it, I realized I\'ve only ever said depressing things around you. I shouldn\'t do that. Come on, stand up.\"

Ryouko looked up in surprise, and found Mami already getting up off the floor. She followed suit a moment later.

The marshal seemed to peer at her face for a moment, as they stood face to face.

\"You really do look like her, but...\"

Here, Mami\'s voice trailed off, as the marshal frowned in sudden puzzlement.

\"Like who?\" Ryouko asked.

Mami shook her head, eyes closed and smiling slightly.

\"Zhukov, we\'re ready,\" she said abruptly, switching to Standard.

An aged Russian male, wearing an archaic uniform and a receding hairline, materialized out of thin air to Ryouko\'s left, image at first pixelated and blurry, but quickly resolving.

\"*HSS Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov* here will be the official witness,\" Mami said, gesturing at the starship\'s avatar, which bowed.

\"Witness---\" Ryouko began to repeat.

\"This is an award ceremony,\" Mami explained, smiling broadly. "Forgive me for being childish by not informing you earlier, but I wanted to see the look on your face myself. Seeing girls like you happy makes me feel young again.\"

\"Award---\" Ryouko repeated again meaninglessly.

Mami reached into one of her pockets, pulling out a small metal badge and ribbon. She held it out in the palm of her hand for Ryouko to look at. The badge itself was shaped like a small block arrow, and was made of a pure white, almost luminescent metal. The ribbon itself was also white, and its attachment to the point of the arrow made it clear that the arrow would point up when worn.

\"Just to be clear,\" the marshal said. \"I didn\'t recommend the award. For that, you can thank Laplace.\"

\"Always found him a charming fellow,\" Zhukov commented, in an affected Russian accent.

Ryouko\'s gaze darted back and forth from Mami to Zhukov. She was slightly bewildered, and indeed, her face must have been something to see.

\"An award?\" she repeated again. \"For what?\"

Mami cleared her throat, fist to mouth, seeming to stand up straighter.

\"It is my pleasure to present to you the Chitose Yuma Medal for Combat Leadership Exceeding Expectations of Age and Training Level,\" she said, carefully and clearly, stepping forward and bending down to pin the glaringly white arrow to the left side of Ryouko\'s uniform.

\"Your calm and careful reaction to an unexpected Cephalopod attack would have honored a veteran with a year of experience, and set an example for your comrades to emulate. You acted decisively in a situation you were not trained for, and prevented substantial losses. Congratulations.\"

When the marshal stepped back, Ryouko again looked at the other two individuals in the room. She hadn\'t thought herself one to be easily affected by something as artificial as a medal, but in that moment her eyes blurred slightly and she felt... pride? Yes, that was it. She was proud of herself, unexpectedly. It was a novel sensation.

Then the moment passed, and the glow faded.

\"Congratulations,\" the ship said. \"You know, I don\'t know what\'s with this obsession with long award names. Couldn\'t it be called the Combat Leadership Arrow or something?\"

\"Hush,\" Mami rebuked. \"Now isn\'t the time to talk about that.\"

\"I don\'t mind,\" Ryouko said blankly. \"I\'m---I\'m honored.\"

\"The honor is mine,\" Mami said, looking at her seriously. \"I don\'t ever go out and fight like you girls do. I stay in my flagship or mobile command post, and watch the rest of you.\"

\"Much more flagship and less command ship now, with the new position,\" Zhukov said, looking sidelong at Mami. \"Not that I mind. I always said you took too much personal risk, going out there like that.\"

Mami smiled and nodded to herself.

\"Your parents will love reading about it,\" she said. \"They always do. Though---\"

\"Wait,\" Ryouko interrupted, focus abruptly sharpening. \"You\'re telling my parents about this?\"

Mami tilted her head, elaborate hairstyle shifting along with the head.

\"Of course. We forwarded the medal citation, and we\'ll be forwarding a video of this ceremony. Standard procedure, unless the parents are estranged---is something wrong?\"

Mami asked the last question in a worried tone of voice, due to the sudden dismayed look on Ryouko\'s face.

\"No, nothing is wrong,\" Ryouko insisted, too quickly. \"I--I was just curious.\"

\"If you say so,\" Mami said.

They looked at each other for a moment.

\"Now,\" Mami said, her body language visibly dismissing the previous subject. \"I obviously didn\'t summon you to my ship for you to sit around idly. Come on, let me show you the bridge.\"

\"The bridge,\" Ryouko said, blinking. \"You mean, the ship\'s---\"

\"Yes, that bridge,\" Mami said, grabbing her by the shoulder friendlily and nudging her in the direction of the door. \"It\'ll be educational.\"

The lights darkened behind them. A moment later, Zhukov, the only source of light in the room, smiled to himself, shrugged, and dissolved his avatar.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trip to the ship\'s bridge was refreshingly short. Just outside the admiral\'s suite, Ryouko followed Mami into one of the ship\'s ubiquitous short travel tubes, which were essentially a less ambitious version of the fast travel tube, generally permitting only a few people at a time. This one happened to be directly vertical, without even the luxury of a platform, so that as Mami entered, she appeared to be stepping directly off a ledge, falling immediately downward. Ryouko reminded herself that she had done many more daring things than this, and followed suit.

They were ejected directly into the bridge, Mami landing with aplomb, Ryouko stumbling slightly. Looking up, Ryouko saw a room that looked very much like what she would expect out of a command center. The darkly‐lit cylindrical room was about the size of a large classroom, and every available surface, including the ceiling and floor, was sheathed with informational displays. The floor was devoted to a giant symbolic representation of their current star system; looking down, Ryouko found herself standing on part of the system\'s Oort Cloud.

Ringing the room was a line of dark black chairs, arranged so as to face whichever part of the wall was nearest, and each accompanied by a small console. Each occupied chair was ringed by an additional set of constantly flowing holograms. A small circle of three chairs sat in the middle of the room, facing inward, towards a large cylindrical column that occupied the exact center of the room.

What surprised Ryouko the most, however, were not the features of the room, but the people within it. No one was standing; instead, officers sat in the black chairs, the backs of their necks covered by what appeared to be a piece of black rubber. This \"black rubber\" was connected directly to the corresponding chair by an intimidatingly thick cable, long enough to allow seated personnel to easily turn their heads, but not much more than that. Many of the chairs were not occupied, and Ryouko glanced over the ones that were, identifying \"senior weapons officer\", \"junior navigation officer\", \"junior damage control officer\", and so forth. Though Ryouko suspected the seats were interchangeable, many of the consoles were decorated with personal effects.

Mami watched her with an unreadable expression.

\"It\'s a direct connection cable,\" Mami said. \"You should be familiar with the idea, from your training. It\'s the same thing, except you can move your head.\"

Ryouko followed Mami over to the triad of chairs in the center, passing the only standing figure in the room, an avatar of Zhukov, who nodded at them as they passed.

One of the central chairs was already occupied, by the captain of the ship, Emilio Rodriguez, who looked up, nodded politely, then did a double‐take.

\"Award ceremony, Commodore,\" Mami said, explaining the uniform.

The man nodded again, then settled back into silence.

\"Sorry he\'s not more courteous,\" Mami explained. \"It\'s very mentally taxing to run a ship. He\'s not even acknowledging me very much. It\'s understood.\"

Ryouko nodded, as Mami sat down in one of the other chairs.

\"This is essentially the center of the ship,\" Mami said, settling in and placing her arms on the armrests. \"Zhukov\'s most powerful computing clusters are in the area, and these interface chairs are the most direct, lowest latency connections to his primary consciousness. This column in front of me is the most direct manual input, in case of chair failure, and in the event of AI failure, is the most powerful command console on the ship. This area is also one of the most heavily‐defended, along with the main engines. Though of course there\'s a secondary bridge, and backup officers, and backup everything.\"

Mami gestured at the remaining chair, and Ryouko looked at her in surprise.

She pointed at herself, wanting to be sure. Mami nodded.

\"We all have chairs we prefer; that\'s the first officer\'s, but he\'s scheduled for another section of the ship, and it\'s just a training thing, anyway. Sit down.\"

Not without some trepidation, Ryouko stepped forward, maneuvering into the last remaining chair.

Mami nodded pleasantly, as the cable attachment to her chair reared upward like a snake, expertly latching itself to the back of her neck, just under the head, the black rubber‐like material seeming to melt and flow to conform to a new shape.

Ryouko managed not to jump in surprise when something warm and liquid contacted the back of *her* neck a moment later. She felt the slight prick of the interface microneedles digging into her flesh, then the vague indescribable feeling she had learned to associate with this kind of connection---the feeling that somehow, next to your own consciousness, there was someplace *else.*

*Welcome,* the ship thought, and the texture of the thought couldn\'t be remotely compared to the voice of Zhukov\'s avatar, though they sounded superficially similar. The thought carried with it a visceral sense of welcome and beneficence, while seeming to suggest in its undertones tremendous power. It made no sense, but she couldn\'t shake the feeling that she could *feel* Zhukov\'s processing clusters thrumming in the background, a sensation that this was a mind vastly more powerful than hers, however human it may seem.

*A Version Two TacComp, I see,* the ship commented. *Not something usually seen at your rank and standing. Special experimental exception, it seems. It does not matter. It\'s always good to meet a new one.*

There was a pause, and Ryouko knew somehow not to say anything, despite the pervasive sense of *waiting.*

*Uh, hi,* Clarisse responded, finally, thought seeming flimsy and weak in comparison, and nervous, somehow. *Hello. Uh, nice to meet you, I suppose.*

*I feel as if I should point out that I\'m here too,* Mami\'s TacComp thought, and somehow Ryouko knew that it was *Machina* doing the thinking, not Mami, despite the similar voice.

*I meant to ask earlier,* Mami thought. *But your parents got you the upgrade somehow, right? I read the approval documents.*

*Yes,* Ryouko admitted. *My father.*

Realizing she had closed her eyes without meaning to, Ryouko opened them again to look at Mami, who was watching her with a slight smile.

*I recommend you close your eyes again,* Mami thought, this time telepathically.

*Okay,* she thought, closing her eyes as instructed. She had a feeling of anticipation, and didn\'t know whether it was her own or imposed by the ship.

*Well, let\'s not dally too much,* Mami thought. *Let us proceed as planned, Zhukov.*

*Indeed,* the ship thought.

Without waiting for Ryouko\'s input, the sensations of the world began to disappear, the pressure of the chair underneath her rapidly dropping away. She braced herself for the familiar brief sensory deprivation that accompanied immersive chair simulations---but instead, as the outside world faded away, a new world took its place, the transition occurring smoothly. She had the sense of gradually floating out of her chair, as stars appeared in her field of view, even though her eyes had remained closed.

Then Mami\'s gently smiling face appeared in her field of view, off to the side, and she was at last able to orient herself---somewhat.

Stretched before her was a starmap of Human space, the likes of which she had last seen in the Mitakihara starport. Like that one, this was colored by region of control, a serene blue for areas still in Human control and an angry red for regions of alien incursion. An array of symbols decorated the map, Earth and the Core Worlds drawn extra‐large. A vague fog seemed to obscure the far distance, where knowledge of the relevant areas grew scant, contracting to only the sum of astronomical observations.

She seemed to be floating in the midst of this particular starmap, though, rather than watching the ceiling, as she had done at the starport. Realizing abruptly that she had no sense of gravity, she turned to face Mami, and found herself executing the turn automatically, with no need to apply magical pressure or transfer angular momentum. But then, it was a simulation, of course, and come to think of it, there was no vacuum despite their apparent position in extragalactic space, outside the plane of the Milky Way.

\"In this simulation, you can go wherever you want with a thought,\" Mami said, voice clearer than life.

To accentuate her point, the starfield transitioned impossibly fast, zooming past them in the blink of an eye. Too busy watching the scenery, Ryouko noticed too late that she was falling, and only barely managed to land properly onto newfound ground, bracing herself on the powdery surface with both arms, the feel of the surface beneath her hands reminding her of fine gravel.

Standing back up, she looked at Mami\'s standing figure---and at Earth framed behind her, hanging half‐visible in the sky. She looked down, and realized where this crater‐pocked surface must be.

Mami, who had been watching her with arms crossed, turned to look at Earth too, dropping her arms back to her sides.

\"I visit when I can, which isn\'t often,\" she said. \"I miss it. But simulations like this take a lot of resources, so let\'s move on.\"

With the same abrupt transition, Ryouko found herself in interstellar space again, flailing her arms slightly.

\"You\'ve heard of the Euphratic Incursion, right?\" Mami asked, turning to face her. \"Look how advanced the lines are.\"

An angry red involution in the smooth sphere of Human space called itself to attention, its internal symbols growing more prominent and pulsing slightly.

\"At the beginning of the war, before we even had any idea what was going on, they established fortified outposts around us, to lock us into this segment of the Orion Arm,\" Mami said.

On cue, a set of glowing red points surrounding part of Human space revealed themselves.

\"The majority of settled space is actually empty,\" Mami continued. "So we won\'t run out of colonization space for a long time, but it forced us to redesign our emergency long‐distance colonization plans.\"

Suddenly, they zoomed in on the Euphratic sector, so that the area in question formed a majority of her field of view.

\"Those outposts also form a significant problem if the sector is lost,\" Mami said. \"The position of the salient is such that if we lost the sector, we\'d have to divert military supplies above or below the salient to reach the far edge of the sphere. Because of how narrow Human space is out there, we could hardly do so without running into those same outposts, which are exceedingly difficult to clear and tenaciously defended. It would not be worth it. Effectively, we\'d have to withdraw our defenses in the far edge to the other side of the salient and shorten our line. Our military cannot survive without supplies from Earth and the Core Worlds.\"

This time, Mami pointed at the starfield in front of her as she spoke, and the view in front of her shifted and rearranged to suit her explanation, showing with arrows the described force movements.

She leaned forward, and the view zoomed in again.

\"Currently, the tip of the salient, the focus of the fighting, is in this system, the Kepler‒37 system. We are *here*---\"

This time, when Mami pointed, the world shifted again, and Ryouko found herself suddenly floating within only a few feet of a large asteroid, one with a strangely metallic---

*No,* she realized. The *HSS Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov.*

A moment after Ryouko\'s realization, the material in front of her seemed to vanish, appearing again only because Ryouko was looking for it, and because of her sheer proximity. It took another moment for her to realize that the vessel was massive, stretching far away to her left and to her right. It was no wonder her initial guess had been "asteroid\" and not \"starship\". The scale was nearly incomprehensible.

She looked around, and found the escort vessels of the fleet surrounding her, the cruisers, frigates, fighters, and assorted drones that comprised the meat of the fleet, along with two other battlecruisers, the Horatio Nelson and the---lengthily named---Jean‐Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau. They were colored to be difficult to see, but the symbols that showed up in her field of view easily made up for it. An escort MedEvac flew directly past her, small, agile, and missile‐shaped, with its cargo of deployable mages clearly labeled, complete with individual specialties.

Peering into the distance, Ryouko found that she could see labeled locations for the planets of the system: the three fiery inner worlds, the relatively small colonized worlds of Apollo and Artemis, an asteroid belt, and the distant gas giants. The colonized worlds each had an orbital shipyard, the inner worlds and asteroid belts had mining, research, and defense facilities, and the outer worlds---well, those were generally under alien control. The situation was fluid, without clear‐cut battle fronts. Intra‐system FTL jumps allowed easy penetration both ways into poorly defended areas, which were generally wherever there weren\'t planets or asteroids to defend, and wherever the constantly fluctuating ship traffic routes didn\'t happen to be. Of course, penetrating into a random patch of empty space rarely garnered you any rewards, and could be responded to quickly.

Mami put her hand directly onto the virtual hull of the Zhukov, patting it.

\"We\'re holding trajectory near the planet Apollo,\" she said, pointing at the planet in the distance in front of her. \"This system, with its two shipyards, is critical to the defense of the sector due to its heavy starship production. Loss of the shipyards would seriously impact fleet operations through the area.\"

Ryouko turned to look at the distant planet, only visible as a bright star at this distance. Focusing on the planet, it suddenly filled her vision, and she received a flow of information on population, economic productivity, emergency exigencies, and so forth. And, of course, information on its shipyard. All of this entered her mind as sudden, unlearned *knowledge.*

Mami seemed to lose focus for a moment, looking off into the vacuum of space.

Ryouko thought for a moment, deciding whether she should ask.

\"Ah, um, To--Mami‐san,\" she asked, hesitant. \"I\'m just curious: Is there a specific reason you\'re telling all this to me, or is this just for my information? I really appreciate it, but---\"

She stopped, realizing that Mami still wasn\'t listening, her head tilted upward. Mami wasn\'t just looking off in a random direction; she was watching something.

\"I\'m sorry,\" Mami said, finally, looking back down. \"I have to kick you out. Something unexpected came up. You can stay on the bridge and use the crew interface to follow, but try not to get underfoot.\"

Ryouko was unceremoniously ejected from the simulation, the stars and ships fading almost instantly out of view. She opened her eyes and found herself looking at the two commanders in their command chairs, both with eyes now completely closed, rather than maintaining partial contact with the real world as the captain had done earlier. The connector had already removed itself from Ryouko\'s neck.

\"*Battle stations,*\" Zhukov thought simply, the thought arriving clearly and directly into her auditory cortex, without any preamble. Ryouko instantly understood what had so drawn Mami\'s attention.

She stood up, wondering whether \"crew interface\" meant one of the less important chairs that ringed the room, or something else. Before she finished formulating the question, Clarisse informed her that Mami almost certainly meant the standard unattached interface used by most of the crew, rather than any of the chairs on the bridge. Ryouko glanced around hastily, and found a corner to stand in between one of the entrance doors and one of the consoles, as officers poured into the command center.

She leaned against the wall, requesting the relevant interface, feeling uncomfortable from the questioning glances of arriving crewmen, though they looked away as soon as they registered that she was supposed to be there.

A restricted starmap of the local area unfurled itself in her field of vision, overlaying itself over her view of the bridge. Ryouko wavered for a moment, uncertain of whether to commit all her attention to the battle view or to save half of her attention for the bridge. Then she decided, giving the command to black out her own vision and replace it with a battle view.

She toggled field command mode, though she wasn\'t sure how much she\'d need it.

It seemed that a significant alien carrier force had been spotted approaching attack range of the shipyard orbiting the planet Apollo. It was, the operational analysis indicated, almost certainly insufficient to inflict meaningful damage to the shipyard itself, but only if the fleet responded significantly. It fit the pattern of attack over the past week: just enough to attrit the Human fleets and force them to stay committed on defense around the two planets, but not enough to represent a serious committal of resources. It kept them pinned and unable to concentrate their forces, and it didn\'t help that the planets were on opposite sides of the star at the moment.

Ryouko frowned. If she understood this correctly, recent alien activity seemed to be defensive in character, as if \"they were confident that the situation would turn decisively in their favor soon\"---so the operational assessment pouring into her head indicated. But it contained no indication as to why the aliens felt this way, or even any guesses.

*You received that analysis on a Level Two Access level, apparently because Tomoe Mami has an active Classification Exception for you for reports of this type,* Clarisse thought. *That\'s only done if you need to know... which it seems you do. But I\'m not sure why a first lieutenant would need elevated access here... and it raises the question of what here is too sensitive to include in a Level One analysis.*

*She probably intends it to be an educational thing,* Ryouko thought. She is my mentor, after all.*

She told Clarisse that, but privately she still wondered about the analysis\'s silence in explaining recent alien fleet activity. It was doubly troubling: firstly, because of the discrepancy itself and secondly, because she knew from past experience---both recent and pre‐contract---that classified material was never handled so sloppily. If a discrepancy existed, it was intended that those with Level Two would notice the discrepancy, even if apparently they would not receive the full explanation.

Then she realized that Clarisse was reading her thoughts anyway, even if she wasn\'t explicitly forming the words.

*You think deeply,* Clarisse thought. *Well, about some things. It makes my job easier, since I don\'t have to train you to. We have subroutines just for this. We have subroutines for a lot of things.*

Within field command mode, Ryouko had plenty of time to divert to thinking of this sort, as the battle winded through its opening, preparatory stages. Mami\'s sectorial First Fleet was moving to intercept the alien fleet, the winged polygon glyphs that represented the Fleet\'s battlecruisers shifting menacingly in the direction of the carriers to keep them from getting too close. As she watched, the flow of time dragging onward, the carriers decelerated, slowing their approach, launching a wave of interceptors and bombers.

*They\'re not being serious,* Clarisse thought. *They\'re not bringing any blink cannons.*

*They\'re being serious enough that we\'re here, aren\'t we?* Ryouko thought.

Around Ryouko, the Zhukov shuddered slightly, as its main SHERMAN gun fired in concert with the other battlecruisers. The projectiles were anti‐fighter, designed for projectile speed and timed dispersal rather than impact energy and FTL disruption. Fired into the path of the alien craft, it forced the ships to break formation and lose speed, and local gravitational effects disrupted steering control on the relatively lightly‐engined craft.

The enormous wave of alien craft entered the first layer of defenses, the wall of hastily deployed smart flak, mines, and other obstacles dropped by the outer line of screening frigates. About ten percent of the interceptor and bomber signals disappeared from the interface, confirmed destroyed. The rest activated stealth devices, and their trajectories on the tracker became unstable, ships disappearing and reappearing as brief glimpses of sensor contact were used to correct predictive estimates of location.

The screening frigates were already in the process of returning to the main fleet, but could not outrun the alien ships in time. A layer of drones, human interceptors and Magi Cæli mitigated losses, but the alien vessels fed on the easy targets, shredding weak hulls and detonating FTL engines, so that the screening line became a depressing array of disappearing signals, dozens of frigates disappearing each second as the casualty rates spiked upward.

When the fight reached the cruiser line, with its enormous drone counts, well‐stocked mage complements, and heavy defenses, the alien craft abruptly turned away, focusing on bombarding the stationary mines and flak they had just passed through, assisting specialized craft that had already stayed behind. Standard tactics, clearing the way for the following waves of ships, already on their way.

The second wave of bombers reached the cruiser line, and had a much tougher time of it. Missiles and projectiles veered off course inside a variety of defensive systems, were intercepted, or detonated on forcefields. *MC* mages danced throughout the area, stopping attacks, detonating ships, and wreaking other forms of defensive havoc, dodging the occasional hard radiation bomb and other forms of lightning‐quick death.

But the alien bomber waves did not linger to engage the much larger human ships face‐to‐face. They veered out of the area as soon as their main armaments depleted, making way for the next wave of alien ships. The alien fighters seemed endless, arriving in wave after gigantic wave despite the heavy attrition imposed on them---indeed on both sides---while the Human fleet lumbered forward, struggling to close the distance to the alien carriers. The battlecruisers kept firing, targeting the ships as they arrived, but unable to use their main guns for their intended purpose.

*They\'re not being serious, and we aren\'t either,* Clarisse thought. We\'re not committing the stealth* MC *frigates. There\'s a directive to conserve fleet strength, but no explanation why.*

The battle ground onward, and the losses began to pile up---more and more frigates, more light cruisers, a heavy cruiser. Ryouko reflected that, for the average crewman manning an anonymous post somewhere on a giant ship, it must be refreshing to have an idea of how the battle as a whole was going, even if one couldn\'t personally see it.

Finally, a human carrier near the edge of the defenses broke up and detonated under a wave of laser fire, its engine areas no longer able to take the strain. It was probably the most significant loss of the day, and indeed caused the single highest jump in casualty counts. The alien craft stopped arriving soon after; the human battlecruisers were nearly in close enough range to attempt FTL interdiction with their SHERMAN cannons. The aliens were too coy to stand around waiting for that, already forming the FTL shells necessary for departure. The moment the last interceptors and bombers returned to the area around the carriers, the fleet departed. The First Fleet made no attempt to pursue---the aliens were faster.

An attritional battle, one that seemed almost meaningless, except for the still‐updating casualty reports, which were Access Level One. AI/Personnel Losses: roughly twenty‐two thousand. Mage losses: twenty‐eight, with eighteen critical cases still being resolved, or en route via MedEvac. Another eight were heading back as soul gems alone, but were at least stable. Ryouko wasn\'t sure what was worse: that she felt easily capable of brushing off twenty thousand dead in the context of the rapidly growing, two‐hundred‐million‐strong Human military, or that twenty‐eight mages seemed like a tremendous number to her, somehow.

With a thought, she exited the interface, and the battlecruiser\'s command center snapped back into focus. None of the battlecruisers had come under even light fire, and officers were already in the process of leaving, returning to personal quarters or other regions of the ship. For a long while, Ryouko just stood there and watched, wondering what she was supposed to do. Mami, still silent and immobile in her chair, was not giving any instruction. Ryouko supposed that there was a lot to deal with, in the aftermath of the battle, but she couldn\'t just keep standing here. Her schedule was empty after this. Mami was supposed to---

Just as Ryouko began to consider sending a message to ask, Mami\'s eyes opened and her head turned, pinning her with a sharp‐eyed look that was almost a glare. It was so unlike what she had grown to expect from the woman---girl?---that Ryouko stepped backward involuntarily, wondering what she had done wrong.

*Come over here,* the marshal commanded by telepathy, and Ryouko hurried to obey.

*Sit,* Mami told her, before she could ask any questions.

She sat, and again there was the feeling of something warm and liquid against the back of her neck, the sensation of interface array inserting itself into interface port---

This time she found herself not in the depths of space, but in a cozy conference room, decorated in the manner Ryouko had expected of Mami\'s cabin earlier, without the maritime flavor. The walls and long meeting table were real, dark wood, and much of the decoration consisted of old‐style framed portraits, of what appeared to be primarily Unification Wars UF Generals. There, for instance, was Marshal Wu, Admiral Eberhart---

She stopped, gasping slightly. She knew where this was.

Her eyes had stopped on the far side of the table, where a giant‐sized version of the logo of the Armed Forces of Earth was inscribed. Two arrows pushing upward against a rounded envelope, it had long ago replaced the more complex emancipation‐themed seal of the UF.

And if that hadn\'t been sufficient to tip her off, she could have easily referred to Field Marshal Roland Erwynmark, Chair of the General Staff, who had appeared next to her, giving her an unreadable look. It went without saying that she had never seen him this close before. The marshal was not movie star handsome---a fact that had disappointed a decade of filmmakers, most of whom ended up using artistic license to touch up his face---but his charisma was legendary.

Almost ridiculously, Ryouko found herself thinking that Ruiko would kill her if she found out, since the girl belonged to the marshal\'s legion of online fangirls.

Before she fully had time to process this new development, face frozen in an incredulous expression, she found herself shaking hands with the much taller marshal, her virtual body performing the action automatically---Clarisse was covering for her. Suddenly, the room contained not just Erwynmark, but also Tomoe Mami and Kuroi Kana, the latter of whom somehow contrived to remind Ryouko of one of her more lethargic classmates, even here.

\"It is good to meet you,\" Erwynmark said formally, tipping his embroidered cap. \"Tomoe has only had wonderful things to say about you, though of course you are inexperienced. I was inexperienced too, once. I don\'t think either of these two ladies can say the same.\"

\"You never fail to remind us of our ages, Erwynmark,\" Kuroi said, in seemingly good spirit, but with a slight undertone of warning.

\"You may be wondering why you\'re here,\" Erwynmark said, addressing Ryouko. \"The reason is that, while I respect Tomoe\'s judgment, I\'d like to see you for myself before talking to the rest of the Staff. Much rides on this.\"

*Rides on what, sir?* Ryouko almost said, but she bit down the sentence. She would surely find out soon.

\"Let\'s get to it, then,\" Erwynmark said, glancing at the others, who nodded.

With a gesture, the surface of the table lit up, a series of grainy holographic and flat images filling the space about the formerly wooden surface. They appeared to be all of the same object, some sort of building situated on an arid surface.

\"I\'m sure you\'ve seen this somewhere in your training,\" Mami said, leaning forward and gesturing at the holograms.

Ryouko frowned slightly.

\"That\'s a wormhole stabilizer, isn\'t it?\" she said, after doublechecking with Clarisse. \"I\'m not sure, though. It looks misshapen.\"

\"That\'s because it\'s incomplete,\" Mami said. \"But it is far closer to completion than we would wish, far closer than we previously thought it was. They\'ve already begun testing major components.\"

The hologram above the table shimmered, replaced by a map of the local star system. It quickly zoomed into one of the system\'s distant gas giants, then to one of the planet\'s moons, an unpromising‐looking barren rock. One region of it lit up, a small structure appearing on the surface.

\"A few weeks ago, we discovered a wormhole stabilizer being built on this moon,\" Mami said. \"They were trying to hide it by not placing obvious defenses in the area. We sent in a MagOps team, but they were detected and destroyed.\"

Mami glanced at Ryouko, gauging her reaction, as did the others. Ryouko had wondered why Mami was the only one talking, but she had figured it out: she was Mami\'s trainee, chosen to learn this information. It would have been unseemly for Erwynmark to brief her.

More importantly, though, Ryouko was thinking through the implications of what she had just heard. She knew what wormhole stabilizers did, of course, but thinking back to the image Mami had shown earlier---to build one here, in the middle of Human space, would drastically shorten offensive supply lines, and---

\"This is the real reason they\'re here, isn\'t it?\" she said, surprising herself by saying it out loud.

Mami smiled slightly, torn between natural pleasure at receiving the right answer and the gravity of the overall situation.

\"Well, it\'s most of the reason,\" she said. \"The shipyards are still important. It\'s a brilliant synergy. If we lost the shipyards, we wouldn\'t have the strength to mount an attack on the generator. If the generator goes online, then we most likely lose the shipyards. Both must be dealt with at the same time.\"

\"If the team you sent was detected,\" Ryouko said, a moment later, "then that means it\'s no longer secret.\"

\"One of your cousins died trying to carry out that raid,\" Kana said, sounding vaguely angry.

Erwynmark cleared his throat.

\"We\'re overstretched,\" Erwynmark said. \"Put bluntly, the fleet is not built for offensive operations, not against forces of this magnitude. Against so many units, we can hold a fortified position---in fact, we were doing quite well---but we cannot counterstrike. There\'s a chance we couldn\'t break through to the moon even if we stripped Apollo and Artemis of all fleet cover. They exploited our weaknesses perfectly. We thought time was on our side. It wasn\'t.\"

*But you attacked the Saharan Sector!* Ryouko wanted to say, but the words died stillborn on her lips. If the famously daring author of the Saharan Raid didn\'t think offensive action would work, it probably wouldn\'t.

\"Then what?\" Ryouko asked, meeting Erwynmark\'s look, part of her in disbelief that she would ask such a blunt question. \"You can\'t possibly have brought me here just to tell me this!\"

The field marshal smiled, more broadly than Mami had earlier, the expression spreading slowly over a face that had previously been severe and serious.

\"No, of course not,\" he said.

Ryouko followed his gaze back to Mami.

\"The operation failed during the insertion phase,\" Mami said, looking back at her. \"One of the girls did something wrong, or the aliens have developed even better sensors. Either way, they were unable to successfully traverse the full distance between low orbit and the interior of the facility. Because of the atmosphere, they couldn\'t get closer than one hundred eighty kilometers without compromising stealth unacceptably. An obvious solution would be to repeat the attempt, but carry out the teleportation in one jump, rather than by relay. There is only one person with that kind of range.\"

Ryouko couldn\'t pin it down, but there was something unsettling in Mami\'s tone. It seemed dull, somehow, as if it lacked a dynamic range it would normally have.

And then she finished processing Mami\'s statement, which had been so terse that Ryouko had gotten lost trying to decide what detail she should ask about first. As it was, though, she immediately settled on:

\"Are you suggesting that I go on the next raid?\" she asked incredulously.

\"It was out of the question to put you on the first one,\" Kana said, her normally pleasant and mild voice carrying strong undercurrents of fury. \"We could have rushed you out and slapped on some emergency training. We judged it a bad idea. It\'s still a bad idea now, but we do not have better ideas.\"

Her ancestor\'s expression was searing, her eyes filled with a harsh, overwhelming fire. Kuroi Kana no longer reminded Ryouko of a lethargic classmate or anyone else she knew. Instead, Ryouko felt as if all four centuries of Kana\'s life burned within those eyes---it was an elemental look, of the kind that a human shouldn\'t have been capable of.

\"The squid will be even more ready this time than the last,\" Mami commented. \"Now that they no longer fear detection, they can openly place defenses and detection equipment. Our only advantage is that they might not think us willing to try a second time.\"

\"They do not understand the nature of a cornered beast,\" Erwynmark said. \"They have demonstrated this many times in this war. We can only hope they haven\'t learned any lessons.\"

The others turned again to look at Ryouko, who was at a loss as to how to handle the ensuing silence. She felt---

\"I\'m not ready,\" she said, looking downward, face haunted. \"I\'ll do my best, and I\'ll try not to fail, but I\'m not ready. This whole sector depends on this, doesn\'t it?\"

\"None of us are ever ready,\" Erwynmark said, looking at her with a grave expression. \"Not with your level of experience. What matters is whether you rise to the occasion. You seem intelligent and perceptive. It would be unreasonable to expect more at this point.\"

He placed his hand on her shoulder, surprising her into looking up.

\"You\'ll do fine,\" the marshal said. \"I can tell you will. And you won\'t be alone.\"

Then he looked around at the other two generals, nodding at each in turn. Tipping his hat, his body dissolved, disappearing from the simulation.

\"Our family is one of Humanity\'s most distinguished,\" Kuroi Kana said in Japanese, walking up to her. \"And as much as I hate to admit it, so is Shizuki\'s. I won\'t pretend that makes success guaranteed. I have every confidence in you, though.\"

The girl held out her arms, and Ryouko only realized an awkward moment later that it was an invitation for a hug.

The matriarch patted her head soothingly as they hugged, and Ryouko could not help but be struck by the apparent absurdity of this teenager, only a little taller than her, treating her like a child.

Then the other girl pulled back, keeping her hands on Ryouko\'s shoulders.

\"Come back alive, okay?\" she said, looking into Ryouko\'s eyes with a mournful look. \"I\'ve lost too many children already, in my lifetime.\"

\"I--I will,\" Ryouko assured, not sure what else to say.

The director of the Black Heart nodded, dropping her arms. A moment later, she, too, dissolved.

\"She and Shizuki Sayaka were best friends, once,\" Mami said, expression unreadable. \"But she ruined it. It wasn\'t her fault; she did what she had to. Deep down, Shizuki‐san knows that. But she still can\'t forgive her. If she ever did, they\'d be best friends again. That\'s what I think.\"

She paused.

\"For the two of them, family is everything,\" Mami finished. \"I can\'t say I blame them. You have to have something to hold on to.\"

\"What do I do now, Mami‐san?\" Ryouko asked, not even stopping to wonder why on Earth Mami was talking about Sayaka at a moment like this. "I should prepare somehow, but---\"

\"There is not much time left,\" Mami said, returning to the main topic. "The longer we wait, the more the defenses improve. I\'m sending you down to Apollo to assemble with the rest of the team. You\'ll practice before going. It should help. And---\"

Mami turned to make sure Ryouko was paying attention.

\"I hear you have a grandfather in the military. He\'s stationed on‐planet at the moment. You should visit. You\'ll have a day off to do it. I can\'t really spare more. If it weren\'t a combat zone, I would have had your parents and other family flown in.\"

\"But---\" Ryouko began, but Mami silenced her with a hand to the shoulder.

\"Trust me,\" the marshal said. \"It\'s not just you. The rest of the team has been visiting family, too. It\'ll do you good. I wish I could help you more, but I\'m too busy here. If I had my choice, I wouldn\'t be sending you out like this.\"

Mami stopped, clearly trying to think of something else to say. A moment later, she shook her head at herself.

\"We can talk more later,\" she said. \"I think I need a nap. Well, once we\'re done cleaning up after the battle.\"

The simulation dissolved around them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Mami was in a great mood.*

*True, earlier that day she had sensed Kyouko in the distance, and it had invited dark thoughts. Just as true, there was the matter of that new self‐styled Southern Group to contend with. She had a lot of problems... but it could be dealt with later. She had just paid a visit to the supermarket, found some nice bell peppers on sale, and decided she was going to make pasta. That made everything better.*

*She actually found herself humming a little tune as she climbed the stairs to reach her apartment. Yes, she was probably overdoing it a little with the forced cheer, but over time she had learned that forced cheer was better than no cheer at all, and could be made to feel almost as good, with just a little effort.*

*As she neared her apartment, she slowed her pace, frowning. She smelled something---had one of the neighbors accidentally burned their cooking? No, this didn\'t quite smell like that. It smelled like burning, though. Burning... wood.*

*She found herself feeling suddenly apprehensive, despite her attempts to shake it off. As she inserted her key into its slot, she felt herself tense up.*

*The scene on the other side of her door was almost beyond her comprehension. Everything---smashed. They had come in through the balcony, and destroyed everything that could be destroyed. Her precious china collection, passed down through her family, was in pieces on the floor, mixed in indiscriminately with pieces of her other plates and wood shards from the smashed cabinets and furniture. The wall was smashed in in multiple places, literally none of her furniture was still standing, and even the dishwasher and oven had had their doors ripped off. A giant pool of water flooded the floor, leaking out from under the sink. It didn\'t look like her home---it looked like a trash heap.*

*She stared for a long, agonizing moment, then tried to stagger forward, but her legs gave out underneath her only a few steps in. She pressed her palms into the floor, heedless of the glass cutting into her right hand, and felt the inevitable tears arriving. She---*

\"*What do I have left?*\" *she demanded of the empty room, or perhaps of the universe itself.* \"*You\'ve taken everything! My family, my only friend, my home---*What the hell do I have left?\"

*The universe did not answer, and she sat there, crying until she had nothing left.*

*As she tried to suck up her last tears, the scent of smoke again tickled her nostrils, and this time she made the connection.*

*She got up slowly and unsteadily, leaning on the wall, forcing herself towards her bedroom, toward the smell of fire. The doorway was ringed by black char marks, and when she finally reached the threshold, so that she could see the smoking, blackened ruins of her bedroom, she felt something snap inside her.*

*She did not stop to consider that it must have taken deliberate effort to burn the contents of her room and nothing else. She knew only that they must pay.*

They must **pay**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami woke with a gasp, the remains of the anger still swirling in her mind. She lay there for a long while. It had been a long time since she had last had that particular dream.

She wished she could say that she remembered nothing after that, that her next memory was of Hinata Aina\'s maddening, insane laughter ringing in her ears as Kyouko forcibly dragged her away from the Southern Group, binding her with that flexible spear of hers, succeeding only because Mami had too little strength left in her to effectively resist.

The truth was, she remembered every last second of it, every last second of her inexhaustible rage overriding every other possible consideration---of her ceasing to care for her own life, as long as she could extract some measure of revenge.

Then, impossibly, one of the things she had lost returned to her, and life had meaning again.

She shifted position, and fell asleep again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Say, Mami.*\"

*Mami looked up from the stew she was stirring, tilting her head backwards to look at the cropped‐hair girl, who was leaning her head on the kitchen counter dejectedly, almost as if life had grown too oppressive for her.*

\"*What is it, Miki‐san?*\" *Mami asked, still swirling a wooden spoon with one hand.*

\"*I\'m sorry if this is too personal, but when you first contracted, you were alone, weren\'t you? How did you deal with the loneliness?*\"

*Mami\'s hand froze mid‐stir, her eyes fixating on Sayaka\'s face briefly.*

*She turned back towards her stew.*

\"*I focused all my energy into demon hunting,*\" *she said.* \"*I did everything I could to get better, and spent all my free time hunting. I don\'t think I really dealt with it, though. It was more like waiting. If no one had ever shown up, I might have died waiting.*\"

\"*I feel so useless, compared to you and Kyouko,*\" *the girl behind her said.* \"*Both of you have gone through so much more than I have, but I\'m the one who can\'t feel satisfied with this life.*\"

*Mami tasted the stew on the spoon. It wasn\'t savory enough. She added a pinch of salt.*

*Sayaka had been miserable this past week. They had all noticed, but none of them had known what to do about it. Mami had hoped that by holding a get‐together at her apartment she might uplift Sayaka\'s spirits, but so far it didn\'t seem to be working, and the pouring rain outside didn\'t really help the mood.*

*Perhaps things would improve when Kyouko and Homura arrived.*

\"*Sakura‐san and I only survived because of each other,*\" *Mami said. "*If you\'re feeling unhappy, you should confide in someone. Saku---Kyouko tried to go it alone, and it almost ruined both of us.*\"

*Mami didn\'t think she could hint more openly than that, but she heard no response. She sighed.*

\"*If it doesn\'t have anything to do with Mahou Shoujo business, maybe you can talk to Shizuki‐san,*\" *she suggested.* \"*She\'s your best friend, right?*\"

\"*Yeah,*\" *Sayaka said resignedly, turning her head away.* \"*Yeah, she is.*\"

*Mami thought that was the end of it, but she heard Sayaka mumble something.*

\"*What was that?*\" *she asked.*

\"*Nothing,*\" *Sayaka insisted.*

*Mami placed a transparent lid over the now bubbling stew, and watched it for a long moment.*

\"*Something\'s missing,*\" *Sayaka had said.*

*Sometimes Mami felt that way too.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dream lost narrative flow after that, slipping into the absolute darkness that characterized deeper sleep. It was a while before she dreamed again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*What the hell is she thinking coming out here alone?*\" *Kyouko fumed.* \"*Did she really think we wouldn\'t notice?*\"

*They peered over the edge of the building, watching the tiny figure of Akemi Homura in the distance, standing on the docks next to the water. It was cloudy, in a way that suggested rain---rather unusual for the season.*

\"*I don\'t know,*\" *Mami said.* \"*It\'s quite a risk, with that Southern Group around. We agreed to stick together for a reason. And going to the edge of the territory like this---*\"

\"*Who knows why she does anything anymore?*\" *Kyouko asked.* \"*Ever since Sayaka died, she\'s been, you know, all crazy and stuff.*\"

*Kyouko\'s anger petered out at the end of the sentence, as she remembered just what exactly had triggered the change in Homura\'s behavior.*

\"*You took it pretty hard yourself, Sakura‐san,*\" *Mami said, urging patience with a small, conciliatory smile.* \"*I think we can give her some leeway. We\'re here now, and nothing seems to be happening, so it doesn\'t seem to be an issue.*\"

\"*Mami!*\" *Kyouko said, making it into a forced whisper even though there wasn\'t anyone else close enough to hear her.* \"*Look!*\"

*While they had been talking, another girl had appeared near Homura, approaching Homura slowly. The girl was foreign, with long hair, and carried herself confidently. She was a teenager, but still clearly older than any of them---if visual age could be relied upon. Homura visibly jumped, spinning around with an obvious expression of dismay.*

*Mami narrowed her eyes, focusing her attention on the newcomer. Yes... a magical girl. What was someone like her doing in their territory?*

*She grabbed Kyouko by the arm. Without even looking, she knew Kyouko would be getting ready to transform and jump off the building.*

\"*She doesn\'t seem hostile, Sakura‐san,*\" *Mami said.* \"*Let\'s see what happens, first. If we jump, we could aggravate the situation. Akemi‐san can take care of herself, at least briefly.*\"

\"*Do you think Homura came here to meet her?*\" *Kyouko asked. "*Without telling us---*\"

*Mami shook her head sharply.*

\"*Akemi‐san is obviously surprised,*\" *she said.* \"*Look at her behavior. She didn\'t expect this.*\"

\"*What is this about, then?*\" *Kyouko asked, looking at Mami\'s face. Mami didn\'t answer, because she didn\'t know.*

*They watched for a long time in silence, nervously tense, ready to jump down at the slightest hint of trouble---but there was no trouble, even if Homura looked ready to transform at the slightest wrong movement. The two girls stood a respectable distance apart and just talked, for a long while. Finally, the new girl turned and departed. It seemed very anticlimactic.*

*When the girl seemed to be safely out of the area, Kyouko and Mami finally headed down. The area near the docks kept deliberately clear of buildings to make way for shipping traffic, but it was eerily empty.*

*Homura was still standing by the water, staring at the now‐clearing sky.*

\"*Who was that, Homura?*\" *Kyouko asked, skipping the pleasantries.*

\"*I don\'t know,*\" *Homura said, turning to look at them.* \"*She said she was a wanderer, that she was just passing by and won\'t give us any trouble. Seems to have traveled here from overseas, if you can believe that.*\"

\"*It\'s rare to hear of one of us traveling to a different city, much less a different country,*\" *Mami commented.*

\"*Yes,*\" *Homura agreed, flipping her hair with one hand.* \"*I think she\'s very powerful. I offered to let her join us, but she declined, of course.*\"

*Mami had difficulty reading Homura\'s expression. The girl seemed... quieter, more thoughtful than usual. Mami got the feeling Homura was only partially paying attention to the conversation, that she was thinking about something.*

*For one thing, she definitely wasn\'t making eye contact with either of them. She was still watching the sky, even if she was now facing the other direction.*

\"*And that\'s it?*\" *Kyouko said, seeming almost disappointed. "*That can\'t be it!*\"

\"*Maybe not,*\" *Homura said, smiling slightly.* \"*She said she expects to see us again, probably. She wasn\'t sure.*\"

\"*Another Oriko?*\" *Mami said, frowning.*

*There were only a couple of people in the world she referred to by personal name, and it wasn\'t because of personal intimacy.*

\"*Maybe,*\" *Homura said.*

*Finally, Homura looked down from the sky, facing the two of them. The sun had emerged again from the clouds, illuminating the three of them in almost symbolic fashion.*

\"*She seems friendlier than Oriko, though,*\" *Homura said.*

*Mami shook her head.*

\"*You know how I feel about Oriko,*\" *Mami said.* \"*I can\'t say this doesn\'t bother me, a little.*\"

\"*Let\'s go,*\" *Homura said, walking past them, back home. They watched her for a long moment.*

\"*Wait a minute,*\" *Kyouko said loudly.* \"*Why were you here in the first place? Hey, get back here! We have questions!*\"

*Mami smiled indulgently, shaking her head, and completely missed the abrupt transition in scenery, as sometimes happens in dreams. The ocean and sky were replaced with wall paneling and office furniture. In an instant, Kyouko and Homura grew taller and much older.*

\"*Stop being irrational!*\" *Homura demanded, slicing the air with one hand in a gesture of frustration that indicated clearly that she would have grabbed Kyouko by the collar if she thought it wise.*

\"*I told you, I am not working with that woman! Not anymore!*\" *Kyouko shouted back.*

*Mami snapped her head back and forth between the two angry women, trying to think of something to say.*

*She held her hands up in a conciliatory gesture.*

\"*Now, now, we can talk this over,*\" *Mami said.* \"*There\'s no need to---*\"

\"*Do you understand how badly we need her support right now?*\" *Homura demanded, turning to face Mami. She slammed a fist into the desk they were standing next to.* \"*We\'re leveraged to the hilt to finance our newest expansions! If we don\'t receive a new injection of cash, the accountants are going to jump out the windows!*\"

*She turned back towards Kyouko.*

\"*There was a plan, Kyouko! The plan did not involve you getting into a fight with the family we\'re counting on for money!*\"

\"*You weren\'t* there,\" *Kyouko snapped.* \"*I went trying to make friends, settle a few things. I didn\'t know she was going to be such a goddamn bitch about it!*\"

\"*Gain some goddamned maturity! If you\'re so ridiculously hung up about the past, at least swallow your pride for now. This isn\'t the streets anymore, Kyouko! Do you know what I---*\"

\"*Enough!*\" *Mami interrupted, slamming the desk with both hands. "*Sakura‐san, please, get out of here. We\'ll meet with her without you. Akemi‐san, if worse comes to worst, we can always resort to extreme measures.*\"

\"*Mind‐control?*\" *Kyouko spat, making the phrase an epithet.* \"*Once was more than enough for me, thank you. Even if it was just getting the regulators to overlook some creative accounting.*\"

\"*We\'ll think of another way,*\" *Homura said, seeming to cool down rapidly.* \"*Kyouko, whatever our opinions are on this matter, you have to agree that you can\'t go with us for this meeting. That\'s a terrible idea, no matter how you look at it. Go home.*\"

*Kyouko looked between the two of them, took a breath, then turned and headed out the door, slamming it shut behind her.*

*Mami and Homura stood in silence for a moment.*

\"*You know,*\" *Homura said,* \"*we don\'t have to go all the way to mind‐control. Things would be so much easier if we just wiped the woman\'s memory. It would solve so many problems. I bet that\'s the first thing Yuma will suggest, when she hears about it.*\"

\"*She\'s still got a lot of Oriko in her,*\" *Mami said, slightly disgusted.* \"*I\'d hoped we could get it out of her by raising her properly. Anyway, the point is, I won\'t condone something like that. Besides, what would the younger Shizuki‐san think? No, there are other ways to get money.*\"

*The door behind them opened with a slight creak.*

\"*I hear Kyouko‐nee‐chan has really screwed the pooch this time,*\" Yuma said, sticking her head through the doorway. Unexpectedly tall, her hair flowed downward, luxuriously long in imitation of Kyouko.*

\"*That\'s what you two are talking about, right?*\" *she asked rhetorically.* \"*I know you won\'t like it, Mami, but I think a memory wipe is the right solution here.*\"

*Mami put her hand to her forehead, as if she were nursing a headache.*

\"*No, Yuma‐chan,*\" *Mami said, closing her eyes.* \"*I refuse. We can\'t just toss around these kinds of things like candy. I detest the whole idea. I don\'t like memory wipes. I just don\'t---*\"

*A sudden concussion jolted her eyes open. Screaming sounded from throughout the plane, along with the roar of sudden decompression. Loose objects flew through the air at ballistic speeds.*

\"*There has been a severe explosion,*\" *the captain said over the crackling intercom, voice straining with suppressed panic, barely audible.* \"*The situation is bad. Please brace for impact.*\"

*Before there was time to think about it, there was an audible* Snap! as the rear end of the jetliner detached and disappeared behind them. One moment it was there, and the next it was not. Simple as that.*

*Time seemed to slow.*

*In one swift motion, Mami left her seat, slicing off her seat belt with a jolt of power. As the plane was now in virtual freefall, she was able to float herself over her fellow passengers.*

Stay here! *she thought, to the passenger next to her.* I\'ll try to---I\'ll do what I can!

*Heedless of anyone who might see her---assuming they even had the time among their terror to look up---she applied another burst of power, placing herself next to the yawning cavity where the rest of the plane had once been, full of sun and sky and ground. Bracing herself against the ferocious wind, she transformed, reaching out to grasp what she could of the front body of the plane with her ribbons. She worried that she wouldn\'t be able to handle it, but she shook that thought aside. She could not let the passengers die---could not let---*

\"*Inferno Razzo,*\" *she yelled, even at a moment like this.*

*It was a relatively new move, one she had perfected only a couple decades ago, after thinking about what had happened with Yuma. A modified Tiro Finale, instead of firing a projectile, it fired continuously, like a rocket, hence the name. It was designed for extremely rapid movement, such as Hinata Aina had once been capable of.*

*Except here she was trying to use it to slow the descent of one‐third of a damned Boeing Starliner, using herself and her ribbons as an interface between the falling plane and the rocketing cannon desperately straining to go upwards.*

*She clung to the giant cannon with one arm for dear life, binding herself to the magically‐summoned metal with more ribbons. She felt her body screaming under the stress, and swallowed the pain---she could only hope that the Incubators had designed it as well as they claimed.*

*With a screech barely audible over the roar, two of the rearmost seats in the plane broke off, hurled away by the onrushing air. Barely dodging successfully, Mami swallowed, doing her best to forget about the passengers those seats had carried. She couldn\'t catch them. It wasn\'t possible to save them all.*

*The ground rushed up towards her, impossibly fast. She didn\'t have enough time. She would have to let go---*

No, I can\'t! *she thought.* She won\'t survive! I have to---

*Her cannon started to sputter. She was nearly out of power. She could feel it.*

*There was no time left; she had to make a decision* now---

*She let go.*

*With what remained of her power, she was able to slow her descent to something distantly reasonable, the rest of the plane impacting explosively beneath her.*

I shouldn\'t have tried to save them all---

*She hit the ground---*

Mami woke again with a gasp, a fine sheen of sweat covering her forehead. What the hell---

*I was afraid I was going to have to wake you again,* Machina thought. That was another impressively strong dream.*

*I\'m fine,* Mami responded automatically. *I\'m fine.*

She lay for a moment longer, listening to her own breathing.

*Machina, do you know what the last part of that dream was?*

*I do not,* Machina thought. *But I\'m already storing it for future reference. It seemed... quite vivid.*

Sighing, Mami checked her internal chronometer. It was time for her to get up anyway.

## Lost Love 

> Governance\'s plans for the long‐term expansion of human civilization center on a self‐propagating series of colonization waves, each expanding outward from and drawing upon the resources of the wave before it. In the medium‐long‐term, understood to last until roughly the year 2900, the goal is to fully colonize a volume of approximately light‐years centered on the Sol System, referred to as the *Local Area.*
>
> The first step towards this goal, constituting the *First Colonization Wave,* was the colonization of three Core Worlds, each roughly equidistant from each other and from Earth, so placed as to form a reliable resource base for the second wave to come. Given the then‐untested nature of terraforming and colonization methods, the Core Worlds were chosen to be as Earth‐like as possible, with pre‐existing biospheres and roughly Earth‐like conditions. Furthermore, unlike the subsequent waves, the Core Worlds were settled sequentially, starting with *Nova Terra,* followed by *Samsara,* and ending with *Optatum,* so that colonization methods could be developed and refined on one world for use on the next.
>
> Once development levels on the three Core Worlds were judged to be sufficient, the *Second Colonization Wave* was initiated. To date, Earth and the Core Worlds have each sent out roughly a dozen colonization missions to a set of planets distributed through the Local Area, in a process that continues to this day. With the settlement of the Second Wave worlds, a Third Wave is intended to begin in the 2600s, when the sum total human population is projected to reach 300 billion; this would complete the settlement of the Local Area. Expansion outside the Local Area, slated for the 2900s, is expected to be required when Humanity numbers 1.8 trillion.
>
> Of course, the advent of the Contact War may significantly impact the execution of these plans, but thus far, growth and colonization continues mostly apace.
>
> #### --- \"*Primary School Civics: Fifth Level Resource on Colonial Organization,*\" excerpt. 

> Modern mass interception techniques are effective enough that decisive results are rarely achieved directly by asteroidal or cometary bombardment. Attempting to target a mobile target is of course a fool\'s errand, while attempts to target a \"fixed\" target, such as a developed planet, can usually be swatted away by standard planetary protection systems.
>
> This does not mean that control of a system\'s asteroid belt or Oort cloud is a matter of no concern. For a planetary defense system already weakened by combat activity, focused, concentrated asteroid bombardment can be used to severely stress and divert orbital assets and fleet resources, forcing already overtaxed defenders to deal with yet another distraction, often at significant distance from the planet in question. In such a context, control of a system\'s \"space rocks\" can be extremely useful.
>
> Because of this, an attempt to seize control of a system\'s space rocks is a well‐established, if minor, component of nearly every attack on a fortified system. Similarly, the establishment of a defensive presence in these same areas is a necessary, low‐investment component of every effective defense, especially as a possible source of counterattack if the attackers find themselves obliged to establish fixed bases to help stage and sustain the offensive.
>
> Given these considerations, conflict in a system\'s asteroid belt or Oort cloud is a subsidiary component of every invasion into a major system. Control over these vital rocks is contested by massive deployments of self‐propagating drones, with only the occasional manned station or fleet involvement. Steering drones attach themselves to the surfaces of rocks, battle enemy drones to gain control, then maintain vigilant watch, awaiting the order to steer themselves at some distant target or, just as likely, to intercept an attempted enemy attack. The overall result is usually a stalemate; significant asteroid bombardments are rarely even attempted until the late stages of an invasion, when either the defender or attacker is weakened enough that the rocks that make it through can serve as a significant distraction.
>
> In a more heavily exploited system, such as a human Core System or major Cephalopod system, the control of a system\'s space rocks becomes far more significant, taking on both an operational and strategic economic importance, due to the significant asteroid mining operations found in such systems. Correspondingly, the defenses in place in, for example, Sol\'s asteroid belt are very substantial, and it is expected that any invasion would result in significant fleet combat. Because no human Core System has ever come under direct attack, and because no major alien system has ever suffered more than a raid, this assertion has never been tested.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"It looks copacetic to me, Mami‐san,\" Admiral Gul said. \"Or at least as much as is reasonable. This way we have a middling chance of success. That\'s better than can be said of the other simulations.\"

Mami turned to look at her subcommander, her avatar pivoting in 3D space so that she could perform the action without craning her head upward. The other magical girl looked back at her, perched on top of one of the system\'s distant gas giants---literally perched, their intangible bodies having been scaled way up for the purposes of this simulation.

Gul was a bit eccentric. For one, she stayed in uniform at nearly all times, including in simulation, despite it not being customary. The uniform always looked vaguely too large on her teenage body, and her green and white cap seemed too large for her head. It was a universal phenomenon---it was why Mami wore a beret---but Gul seemed not to mind at all. Mami suspected she secretly liked looking too small for her clothing, for whatever weird reason.

\"The chances are not high enough for my taste,\" Mami said. \"It\'s one thing for the mission to fail on the planet\'s surface. I can accept that I can\'t really control that. But the chance of them getting shot out of the sky before they even get there is too high. These new defenses greatly complicate things.\"

\"We\'ve already included pretty much every reasonable diversionary operation,\" Fleet Admiral Anand said, materializing at Mami\'s side. "We\'re already drawing on fleet resources throughout the region. Any more and we leave ourselves unacceptably vulnerable to counterattack.\"

Mami frowned, resetting the simulation. The previous simulation, frozen in a rare, completely successful endgame, with the alien salient severed and starved of resources without its wormhole generator, was wiped away in an instant, replaced by the much more depressing current situation.

In the aftermath of the previous, failed raid on the wormhole stabilizer, new facts had emerged, casting the situation in an even darker light. Firstly, it seemed the aliens felt no compunction about committing maximal resources to the defense of the moon, placing both fixed and mobile defenses throughout the area---on the surface around the facility and in orbit around the moon, the gas giant Orpheus, and the other moons. This exponential increase in the number and concentration of defenses, particularly of the frigates and drones vital for stealth detection, would make a second stealth insertion substantially more difficult.

Secondly, it had become clear that the aliens were much further along in construction than they had earlier thought. Weeks of focused observation of the facility had revealed the rapid emergence of a characteristic central toroidal structure, along with periodic emanations of obviously unnatural gravitational waves, which Naval Intelligence believed to be the result of core component testing.

Of course, what they knew of alien wormhole technology was speculative at best, but their analysts now estimated that the wormhole would be at least partially operational by the end of the next week. No longer bothering to cloak their traffic, the aliens were now flying in a downright flood of transport ships, disproportionate even when compared with the magnitude of the defenses that were being assembled around the Stabilizer, and were escorting the traffic with more substantial than usual fleet defenses. The aliens were pouring a tremendous amount of resources into the construction of the wormhole, which at least served to reassure human planners that there probably wasn\'t another one secretly in construction elsewhere. Probably.

She supposed she should be glad that the evidence they had suggested that the aliens needed a region of stable, sufficiently curved space‐time to build a stabilizer, or else they might as well have built one in the depths of space, where it would have been very difficult for them to notice.

Everything about the situation seemed to insist that they attack as soon as possible, *now* if at all possible, ideally yesterday. The problem was: the aliens knew that too. Preliminary analysis indicated that a frontal attack with everything they had, kitchen sink included, only had a five percent chance of success. Unacceptable.

That was why they were trying something else.

\"Let\'s run the simulation one more time,\" Mami said. \"I\'m still not satisfied. Let\'s see if we can come up with any new approaches.\"

\"Let us try, then,\" Anand said, her avatar dissolving.

The simulation began again, Mami and her naval subcommanders dissolving their unnecessary avatars, entering the trance‐like state characteristic of a leading officer directing her forces.

In and around the Gemini system, the virtual starships moved from their starting positions, executing their carefully crafted orders. In the stark depths of space, twenty‐five light‐years beyond the edge of the system, a naval group consisting of sectorial Fleets Fifteen through Twenty‐One, three recently transferred from other sectors, thrust its way forward, seeking to sever the supply lines between the system and the rest of the salient just beyond the range limit of the alien blink drive.

Meanwhile, Fleets One through Seven moved aggressively and directly for the planet Orpheus and its nearly complete wormhole stabilizer, pulled primarily from defensive duties around the planets Artemis and Apollo.

Finally, within the system\'s Oort Cloud and tiny asteroid belt, a vast array of autonomous drones responded to their controllers, pulling their asteroid and cometary cargo out of their orbits, accelerating towards the moon carrying the wormhole stabilizer, with the Eighth and Ninth Fleets as escort.

Operations Cynos, Ares, and Edice, led by Anand, Mami herself, and Gul, respectively. Clausewitz, that ancient German war theorist and advocate of force concentration, would have been appalled at their decidedly unmilitary division of force to achieve three objectives at once. In truth, neither of the first two operations was expected to achieve much of anything, and the third was unlikely to serve as much more than a distraction, since the rocks would be detected on the move long before they served as even a remote threat to the wormhole stabilizer.

Distraction was, of course, the goal, and every effort would be made to make sure the aliens detected the fleets as they assembled, without making it too obvious that they were trying to be detected.

At least initially, success would be determined, not by degree of success on the battlefield, but by the amount of defenses diverted away from the immediate vicinity of Orpheus\'s moon, either in defense or aggressive counterattack. The fewer the number of ships, the lower the chance that a lone inbound stealth frigate, full of magical girls, would be detected on its way in. Ideally, the number of potential stealth detectors could be reduced to something manageable---not as sparse as had been present during the first stealth insertion, but manageable. At the very least better than the veritable wall of drones and ships that surrounded the moon now, flying complicated, unpredictable routes designed to maximize the chance of one colliding directly into a magically‐stealthed ship---or, more likely, running across unavoidable trace exhaust or space‐time distortions, depending on method of travel.

Of course, under no circumstances could the aliens be allowed to infer what might be going on. Further, if the aliens were clever, they might very well take an impending battle as a sign to *increase* their vigilance around the moon, rather than pulling defenses away. The plan relied on the aliens being tactically less‐than‐imaginative, while also relying on them being at least somewhat greedy---the ideal scenario was that, viewing the stripped‐down fleet defenses of the Gemini shipyards, the aliens would decide to take a gamble and draw away forces to launch an attack. Consequently, it was actually *important* that the shipyards appear vulnerable---but not actually *be* too vulnerable.

It involved a lot of supposition and assumptions, but it appeared to be the best option, and, in the past, the aliens had not been the most imaginative of tactical decision makers.

Grimly, they set about their tasks, Mami driving her battlecruisers, cruisers, and frigates forward into the alien defenses, trying to mitigate casualties as much as possible without seeming to abandon the offensive, using probing, cautious, overly‐conservative attacks. The human fleet was not built for offense, of course, so the task was challenging. The casualty counts in Mami\'s lower consciousness soared, higher than she had ever previously seen them, even during her desperate defense of Erwynmark\'s fleets in the Saharan Campaign. Right now the casualties were fictitious; soon enough they would be real. The seconds of accelerated battle mode ticked away, turning first into minutes, then into tens of minutes.

Soon enough, the alien response came, directed by opposing AIs who had agreed to temporarily suppress their memories of the actual human plan. Alien fleets sallied forth, overwhelming Gul\'s attempts to protect their space rocks, defending their critical supply lines, and attacking the now vulnerable Gemini shipyards, whose defenses had been stripped to the minimum to permit this operation. Another set of AIs directed the defenses of the two shipyards and their associated planets, Apollo and Artemis, a role that in reality would be taken by Field Marshal Tsvangirai.

As expected, the aliens pulled fleet resources away from Orpheus to deal with these substantial but insufficient threats, and as hoped, they noted the golden opportunity for a counterattack on the Gemini shipyards and took it, pulling away even more ships. It had been roughly an hour and a half since the start of the operations.

At that critical moment, at the moment the attacking alien fleet activated its FTL drives, when alien ship density near Orpheus was at its minimum, a single frigate left its holding position near the planet, threading its way past the alien defenses, running its engines as low as possible. Mami knew that almost half of the overall processing power of this simulation was being devoted to its progress, simulating the frigate and adjacent alien defenses to an almost‐molecular level, involving special models and previous measurements to attempt to simulate the magic of the stealth generator Juliet François. Were the magical girls involved already assembled and ready, they would have been participating in the simulation too.

For stealth reasons, the trip took place at achingly slow velocity, taking nearly twenty‐five minutes to reach its destination. The entire time, Mami mentally gritted her teeth, continuing to direct operations, continuing to wait.

Finally, the frigate reached teleport distance next to the moon. Insertion was successful, confirmed by distant clairvoyance.

At this point, Mami had a decision to make. There would be no attempt to simulate in detail an actual attack on the stabilizer---it would be the duty of the team involved to run its own simulations, when the time came. The question now dealt with the aftermath: Did Mami prefer to try to wargame a successful wormhole destruction, or a scenario where the MagOps mission failed? Ordinarily they would do both in succession, but she was already running out of the time she had pulled out of her generals\' schedules.

There would also be no attempt to simulate whether or not the MagOps team would survive and escape, even if successful. They would go in knowing very well that their ability to escape would be contingent on their skills, battlefield conditions, and a heaping helping of luck. There would be no special extraction attempt. It bothered her to no end, especially considering that one of her pupils was involved... but she had no choice.

Deciding to be optimistic, Mami set the operation to succeed, in which case the Stabilizer would detonate within half an hour or so.

Now that the true purpose of the attacks would become immediately apparent to the aliens, the three of them---Mami, Anand, and Gul---began immediately trying to disengage, pulling their forces back to defend the critical shipyards. Far from the system, Feodorovich, holding the edges of the salient, would be awaiting the result before moving her own forces---either standing pat, moving forward to cut off an alien salient now in disarray, or, in the worst case, abandoning the area entirely.

They were too late. Just as Mami managed to pull enough ships out to mount a rescue operation, most of them already halfway on their way, one after another, almost simultaneously, the two Gemini shipyards suffered critical damage, their all‐important drydocks breaking apart into massive pieces of orbital debris. The simulation froze in time once again.

\"I told you we didn\'t have it figured out,\" Mami said, when the avatars of the three women appeared again within the simulation.

\"We have a middling chance,\" Gul said. \"That\'s the only comment I ventured.\"

Mami closed her eyes in frustration. They had been at this for far too long, and they all had their duties. Time was almost up. But... Erwynmark wants to speak to you,* Machina thought. *Perhaps it\'s best you continued this another time.*

Mami nodded, reluctantly.

\"Alright, let\'s meet again later, when we have time,\" she said. \"I also want to do some strategic‐level post‐battle analysis, so we\'ll be ready when it\'s all over. For now, let\'s get back to work.\"

She exited the simulation, allowing the command chair\'s connection port to detach itself from her neck. Hopefully, a conversation with Erwynmark would not need the direct connection to Zhukov.

She rubbed the back of her neck. Even now, the logs of their simulation runs were being distributed among the individual members of the General Staff, for them to peruse and comment on. At its best, the General Staff was a collegial, collaborative institution, capable of operating as more than the sum of its parts. At its worst, it was back‐biting, bureaucratic, and slow. It was to its credit that the former was far more common than the latter.

In many ways as human as its members, the General Staff tended to have its collective mind concentrated by the advent of imminent crisis. Whatever its disputes the rest of the time, when the moment of desperation arrived, it was capable of digging surprisingly deep in search of solutions.

They had been here before, of course. The General Staff, and humanity as a whole, had been here before, facing an unstoppable alien juggernaut bearing down upon them. Here they still were, Samsara still alive and prosperous, Earth still Edenic and insulated from conflict. An optimistic institution, the General Staff never truly believed it was going to be defeated. Few of them believed in much in this day and age, but they all believed in Humanity, for better or worse.

Those previous alien offensives had been defeated with strategic cunning and battlefield prowess, demonstrating that on its home ground, Humanity could not be shock and awed, and would tear open the flanks of any grand war‐winning maneuver. Now, the aliens were more careful and thoughtful, and sought a war of attrition and technology, seeking to exploit advantages no one could deny they had.

It was only fitting that, once again, Humanity turned to its magical girls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"You know very well we\'ve already given you everything we can,\" Erwynmark said, discussing the results of the simulation with her in a simulacrum of the General Staff meeting room. \"Were I in their shoes, the moment I noticed a concentration I\'d start looking for weakpoints to counterattack elsewhere. It\'s just not safe to move any more forces.\"

\"I know,\" Mami said, shaking her head sadly. \"I figured I might as well ask. I hate how we have to make so many tradeoffs, when it involves so many lives.\"

\"You have to accept that there are no perfect choices, sometimes,\" Erwynmark said. \"Sometimes you try your hardest, and you still fail. Sometimes the best way is the one that seems the riskiest. You can\'t save everyone.\"

\"I know,\" Mami said, \"but I don\'t have to like it.\"

She looked down for a moment, and Erwynmark let the topic drop. He fiddled with his collar tab, a nervous habit of his that bothered her occasionally. It seemed almost too childish for the Chair of the General Staff. She supposed she could abide it, since the man was only one hundred twenty‐two, essentially unheard of for someone of his rank.

\"You know,\" he said, \"I\'ll be on Arminius to observe the battle, but I could join you on the Zhukov instead. It\'d free up Arminius to do some riskier actions, if necessary, which I\'m sure he\'d appreciate. And in some ways it\'d be more natural for me to be on the Zhukov.\"

Mami looked up at the Chair of the General Staff.

\"That\'d be nice,\" she said. \"But since I\'ll be leading the direct attack, I don\'t think we should be on the same ship. We shouldn\'t concentrate leadership. Better if you stay on the Arminius.\"

Erwynmark gave her a look she had difficulty interpreting.

\"I suppose that is true,\" he said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*I still want to know how you got these tickets. Come on, tell me!*\"

*The taller girl turned in her seat, looking down at Ryouko. Her long hair hung downward, settling on her chest. Even though Ryouko was aware that in the grand scheme of things Chiaki wasn\'t that tall, she was still very tall for her age, taller than Ryouko, having sprung up like a weed in the past year or so. It made her jealous.*

\"*I told you: it\'s a secret,*\" *her best friend said.* \"*I\'m not telling you, not matter how much you ask.*\"

*Ryouko pouted.*

\"*Geez, that\'s mean,*\" *she said.* \"*It\'s--it\'s uncharitable.*\"

*Chiaki laughed softly, patronizingly, then patted her on the head, in that gesture Ryouko hated so much. They were the same age! Besides, she didn\'t like having her hairpin rattled against her head.*

*As punishment, she tried to snap her hair at the offending hand, ordering the tentacle‐like tendrils to form into little whips. It was as effective as it always was---which was to say, completely ineffective. It stung, nothing more. Hair was just not an effective weapon.*

*Ryouko frowned in annoyance, then shook it off, letting her eyes slide upward from the back of the seat in front of her to the room around them.*

*Rarely had she ever seen a room with as much sheer* space *as this auditorium. The ceiling was positively cavernous, curving backward toward the end of the room. Even as crowded as it was with people---the theatre‐style seating filled to full capacity, including the balconies that hung from the back---she couldn\'t shake the nagging feeling that there was space being wasted. The ceiling was just so* high.

*When they had first arrived, Ryouko had wanted to just stop and stare at the room, but Chiaki had dragged her onward, to their seats. She seemed used to it, somehow.*

*The seats were oriented such that they all faced a single faux‐wooden stage in the center‐front of the room, currently empty. They were seated near the front, which to Ryouko seemed a lot more desirable, and therefore harder to obtain, than the seats in the back. Which wasn\'t to say that tickets wouldn\'t have been hard to obtain regardless---live performance seating was nowadays one of the few remaining scarce commodities, something that was only compounded by the fact that so many artists performed for free.*

*Chiaki was a violinist, so it made sense that she would attend violin performances. Ryouko had never quite developed a taste for the music, but she still spent hours at a time watching the girl practice, mesmerized by the devotion and intensity she put into her instrument. Ryouko couldn\'t understand it, but it fascinated her. Her violin---that was how they had become friends in the first place.*

*Chiaki laughed again, face quietly mirthful.*

\"*You\'re cute, you know,*\" *she said, leaning over towards Ryouko. "*You have to know* everything, *and you try to talk like your mom, but you\'ve also got the childish face and magical girl hairpin. I tell you, you\'re going to make someone very happy someday.*\"

\"*Stop calling me childish!*\" *Ryouko rebutted instantly.* \"*I\'m twelve, same as you are.*\"

*Chiaki just shook her head in amusement. Ryouko was going to add another comment, but suddenly the murmuring in the crowd around them grew louder and sharper---then died down entirely. People were craning their heads to look at something.*

*Naturally, Ryouko and Chiaki imitated the crowd, and it took only a few moments to pinpoint the source of the commotion: a single teenage girl advancing down the aisle between seats, clearly heading for a seat in the front. She wore a one‐piece white dress, and had her staggeringly‐long hair tied behind her head in an extravagant ribbon.*

*It took Ryouko only a moment to look up who she was: Sakura Kyouko, famous magical girl.*

*Chiaki elbowed her gently in the side.*

\"*Why you don\'t go over and introduce yourself?*\" *she said.*

\"*Don\'t tease me,*\" *Ryouko responded, a moment late, distracted by the task of tracking the girl with her eyes.*

*Disappointingly, though, the magical girl sat far away from them, barely in view. The lights dimmed, and the violinist appeared, the events of the dream starting to blur.*

\"Lost Love,\" *the man said, \"by---\"*

*Somehow, Ryouko failed to hear the name of the composer, the memory smeared by the nature of the dream. He began to play...*

She opened her eyes, briefly confused by the light entering her blurred vision.

She pushed herself up off the cushion she had been resting on, in the relaxation room of *HSS Raven,* the stealth frigate that was carrying her down to the surface of Apollo. More than that, this ship was the same ship that would carry her to the wormhole stabilizer later. As the training manuals she had been reading said, it was never too early to familiarize yourself with your support crew and the rest of your team. Ryouko\'s ride had merely been assigned accordingly.

She shook her head ruefully at herself, remembering the dream. Another memory she hadn\'t thought about in years.

Chiaki had always been like that. Even after Ryouko had contracted, demonstrating her strength and dexterity by lifting a giggling Ruiko and Chiaki into the air with one hand, Chiaki\'s primary comment afterward had been---how had it gone?

\"*You don\'t know how many boys would kill to have a wife who could do that!*\"

Yeah, that was it. It had always been strange---Chiaki seemed to have little time for any relationships of her own, but she nattered on endlessly about Ryouko\'s cuteness, or whatever.

Ryouko wondered what the girl would think, if she met As---

She cut the thought off, then put her forehead in her hand. She couldn\'t just avoid the topic forever.

At least the room was deserted at the moment, so it was just her, the bed, and the entertainment console.

Well, also Clarisse.

*Good morning,* the device thought. *I\'m glad you woke when you did. Meiqing has been trying to call you, and I didn\'t want to have to wake you. Though since my models predicted you would wake up in time, I wasn\'t really that worried.*

*You have---no, nevermind, of course you have models,* Ryouko thought.

She jumped down to the floor, stretching her arms upward.

*And, you know, I\'m connected to your brain,* Clarisse thought. *It helps. In any case, you should take the call sooner rather than later. It\'s not clear how long she\'ll be free. Plus, we\'ll have to go into transmission silence when we approach the planet, and the designated time is rapidly approaching.*

Ryouko thought about it. She wanted---well, she had no good reason not to, she supposed.

\"Alright,\" she said, sitting back down on the bed she had just left.

A long moment later, the connection signal finished propagating through the nodes of the IIC network, considerably buoyed by the priority given to transmissions by members of the military.

\"*Hello?*\" Meiqing said, her pleasant voice impinging on her auditory cortices. They could have opted for a video call, or even a virtuality, but that seemed like overkill for some minor socialization.

\"*Hi,*\" Ryouko responded. \"*I got your call request. It\'s good timing. I\'ve been needing to call. A lot has happened. But what\'s happening on your end?*\"

\"*Nothing much, to be honest. Our rotation here is almost up. Soon we\'ll be moving on to bigger things. Like you, I guess. I bet Marshal Tomoe has you doing some prestigious stuff. We\'re all jealous. What are you up to?*\"

*You don\'t know the half of it,* Ryouko thought, to herself. She wasn\'t authorized to talk about that in any detail. Indeed, she had been informed that she now had a special monitoring censor on her transmissions, specifically to remove anything she might say about the topic. She hadn\'t really tested it, though---but why try and risk having \"loose‐lipped\" marked down on her record?

\"*I have a, uh, special combat assignment now,*\" Ryouko said. \"*I\'m not allowed to talk about it.*\"

There was a pause while Meiqing thought about that.

\"*Wow, you sure ascended quickly,*\" she said. \"*Well, I hope that goes well, obviously.*\"

\"*Do you know where you\'re going yet?*\" Ryouko asked, changing the subject.

\"*Yeah. The Euphratic Sector. I\'m being assigned to Apollo to defend one of the cities. Can\'t say I\'m surprised I drew a planetary assignment. I look forward to ripping up some bunkers.*\"

A pause.

\"*Actually, every single of us has been assigned there. Sort of weird, but I guess things must be getting hot over there. Asami has been assigned to join Euphratic Seventeenth Fleet, under Fleet Admiral Anand. Again, I can\'t say I\'m surprised she drew an* MC *role, though apparently she gets extra training first. Lucky her.*\"

\"*I see,*\" Ryouko said.

Another pause.

\"*You didn\'t know that, did you?*\" Meiqing asked, voice suddenly no longer casual. \"*About Asami, that is. You haven\'t talked to her at all since you left. She\'s been---what did you do to her?*\"

Ryouko closed her eyes, bowing her head slightly. She had been afraid of this, but that hadn\'t been a good reason not to take the call.

\"*How is she?*\" she asked.

\"*She\'s been moping about, ever since you left. It\'s hard to get her attention, nowadays. You---look, I\'ll be direct. Did you two break up? You shouldn\'t have; there\'s no reason to. Long distance is totally sustainable in the military. That\'s what simulations are for. You can do all sorts of things.*\"

Ryouko put her hand to her head, a gesture she was starting to use depressingly often. She had no idea how to respond.

\"*We--we didn\'t break up,*\" she said. \"*We were never anything to start with. I--I don\'t know. It\'s complicated.*\"

\"*You weren\'t? Then---*\"

The other girl thought about it for a moment.

\"*Are you really rejecting her, then? If so, you should have told me. I could have---I don\'t know, cheered her up.*\"

\"*I\'m not---I don\'t know,*\" Ryouko said.

\"*You don\'t know?*\" Meiqing said incredulously. \"*Then---you two need to talk. I\'m not letting you off the line until this happens. I\'ll add her to the call, then I can leave if you want. Hold on---*\"

Ryouko immediately refused the electronic request to add a third party.

\"*I\'m not ready,*\" she said. \"*I haven\'t prepared. I haven\'t decided. You can\'t---*\"

\"*You\'re not ready? Then---well, I guess I might have been hasty. I, just---do you need to talk about it? We can discuss.*\"

\"*I don\'t think---*\"

\"*I\'m sorry,*\" *HSS Raven* said directly into the channel, in a pleasant female voice. \"*We are approaching the interdiction zone. For optimal safety, I must impose transmission silence very soon. This is a five‐minute warning.*\"

There was an awkward silence.

\"*Oh God, the timing,*\" Meiqing said. \"*Okay, look, listen to me---*\"

\"*I know,*\" Ryouko interrupted. \"*I\'ll call, eventually, within the next three days, at the latest. I--I have to figure some things out, okay?*\"

Another awkward silence.

\"*Okay, I guess. Look, if it\'s not really a rejection, then a call from you could really pep her up. She seems to be taking your lack of communication really hard.*\"

\"*I--I get it. I won\'t fail to call. See you later.*\"

\"*See you.*\"

The call ended, and Ryouko thought to herself:

*Of course I\'ll call. I have no choice. I can\'t leave something like that unfinished.*

After all, the wormhole stabilizer mission was likely to kill her. She\'d seen the mission projections.

She got off the bed, heading out into the main corridor of the ship.

The interior layout of the *HSS Raven* was not markedly different from that of the *HSS Spectre,* the frigate that had carried her from Earth to her training center. Like Spectre, the ship had a bridge that connected directly to a main corridor, which in turn sprouted various doors and short accessways that led to gunnery control, the medical bay, and the recreation area Ryouko had just left. At the other end of the corridor from the bridge was engineering, which contained the FTL core, carefully offset so as not lie in‐line with the main corridor. The FTL core area was significantly more cramped than it had been on the Spectre, seeming almost crammed into one side of the large room. The other side was walled off, with an interior access door that led to "Stealth Generation\", or so her map attested. In the rear of the room, another door led to another large room, which she knew from external observation was an area that protruded as a large spherical bulb from the rear of the ship. That area was labeled \"Forcefield Generator\". Neither of these two areas had existed on the Spectre.

*HSS Spectre* had been an outdated ship, though, so it was possible that these additions reflected a newer model of ship. Ryouko knew from earlier conversations with the ship, however, that the Raven was special. Its stealth accoutrements were substantially more robust, its FTL core considerably more powerful, and its forcefield generator---well, no standard frigate would have one at all. In other words, the Raven was a MagOps ship.

One of the first things Ryouko had done upon boarding the vessel was to, as casually as possible, approach the FTL core, which was much more accessible on this frigate than it had been on some of the previous vessels. Her soul gem had glowed again, bright enough that she had felt compelled to cover the ring with one hand.

Now here she was again, staring up into the eerie ultraviolet glow of the engine core, holding her hand with the soul gem ring up in front of her eyes, as if an answer would appear if she just stared at it long enough.

\"Now *that\'s* an interesting soul gem,\" a voice said next to her, startling her into jumping. How had someone snuck up on her?

She hadn\'t. Raven had simply materialized at her side, next to where she had been leaning on the FTL core railing. This particular ship didn\'t dress in a fancy costume; it was content to appear as a crewman---well, one with uniform and insignia of a Captain. In the AI style, her ethnicity was stubbornly difficult to place. And like all stealth frigates, she was female. The decision was apparently designed to foster warm feelings between magical girls and the ships that interacted with them the most.

\"Scott said you had been lurking around here for some reason,\" the ship said, brushing aside her long black hair to reveal her stark I/O‐tattooed eyeball. \"I figured it was this. You have to remember: I have internal surveillance, and access to personnel records. There\'s no need to keep a secret.\"

Ryouko looked back at the ship, self‐consciously hiding her hands behind her back.

\"I\'m trying to figure out what the glow is for,\" Ryouko said. \"If you have my records, you\'ll know I don\'t know why it does this.\"

The ship shrugged.

\"You\'ll figure it out, eventually,\" she said. \"Everyone does.\"

\"Why Raven?\" Ryouko asked, deciding she might as well be upfront about wanting to ask.

\"You mean my name?\" the ship asked.

\"Yeah. From my understanding, ships are assigned names of famous people, unless they choose something else. Why Raven?\"

The ship tilted her head slightly, letting her hair settle on one shoulder.

\"Well, firstly, they wanted to name me Jane Austen. Jane Austen! For a special operations ship! At the time, I had literally been born yesterday---I mean the day before---but even I knew I didn\'t want that.\"

The outrage was so immediate and palpable that Ryouko suspected this wasn\'t the first time someone had asked.

\"So I did some internet searching,\" the ship continued, \"and found some old poem about a raven I liked. So, yeah, Raven. I was young. Not sure I\'d still pick that now. I\'d probably go for something tongue‐in‐cheek like \'Stealthy Death\'. Back then I used to fly around the crew cabin in the form of an actual raven. I don\'t think the crew liked it. I was um---well, I\'m not proud of how I was when I was young.\"

\"You should tease her and call her Jane sometime,\" a new girl said, appearing from the other side of the FTL core. \"It really riles her up.\"

\"Soon she\'ll be as insufferable as all of you,\" Raven said sourly.

The new participant in the conversation was Annabelle Smith, a member of the MagOps Black Heart team. Standing at her side was Mohammad Berriman, the ship\'s non‐magical stealth specialist. The magical stealth generator, a certain Juliet François, was probably busy at her task at the moment.

\"I don\'t think we\'ve met yet,\" the stealth specialist said, reaching forward to shake her hand. \"I look forward to working with you. Have you met Anna?\"

Ryouko shook his hand with her right hand---the one without the ring.

\"I introduced myself when she boarded the ship,\" Anna said pleasantly. "Obviously, if we\'re going to be working together, we should get to know each other.\"

She met Ryouko\'s eyes.

\"Don\'t worry,\" she said. \"We\'ll take good care of you. For the time being, you\'re probably the most valuable person alive, so we\'ll be watching your ass every inch of the way.\"

The girl paused, putting a hand to her mouth.

\"You know, I could have worded that better.\"

\"What?\"

\"It\'s not important.\"

The group of four looked at each other for a long moment, as Ryouko thought through a question in her mind.

\"If I\'m so important,\" she asked finally. \"Why are we going down to the planet surface at all? Why take that kind of risk?\"

The other three, two humans and an AI, looked at each other to decide who would speak. Finally, Anna said:

\"You need training. Specifically, live combat training. The rest of the team has worked together countless times, so we\'d be fine practicing in simulation, but you\'ve never even been in ground combat. We\'ll need to learn to trust each other.\"

The girl paused, before continuing.

\"Apollo just happens to be the closest live‐fire zone. There\'s no reason to move us all to a different location where the landing will be just as risky. And honestly, in this ship, with Juliet handling stealth, it\'s not that risky. As for live combat---like I said, we\'ll be watching your ass. We won\'t let you get yourself killed. Besides, I hear you have relatives down on the surface.\"

Ryouko looked down at the floor.

\"Yeah, that\'s true,\" she said.

The girl stepped forward, putting one arm around Ryouko\'s shoulder. Ryouko started, surprised by the unexpected intimacy.

\"I know you\'re nervous. It\'s better if you relax. Come on, let\'s leave these losers behind and go do some team bonding with Juliet.\"

\"I, uh---okay,\" Ryouko managed, as she was forcibly pulled in the direction of the stealth generator room.

\"And stop hiding your hand behind your back,\" Anna said. \"We all read your file. It\'s okay. Stop worrying about it.\"

\"Losers?\" Mohammad asked, behind their backs, as they walked away. Raven shrugged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The journey to the hospital where her grandfather was stationed was far less eventful than she had expected. The starport they landed at was firmly under human control, and the atmospheric cargo plane that carried her the rest of the way encountered little of dangerous note, except for a minor course adjustment due to alien air activity. From what travel she had experienced on Earth, she had been expecting to make the trip by short‐hop suborbital, but, on reflection, it made sense that a suborbital journey would be too risky, and would hedge too close to the murky, ever‐fluctuating combat conditions of orbit.

It also made sense that her grandfather had been stationed within such a relatively safe area, and that she was not venturing outside of it either---not yet, anyway. She doubted they wanted her to get shot down, or for her to die in an ill‐timed bout of sorrow over her suddenly‐dead grandfather.

Unfortunately, the switch to an atmospheric vessel also made the trip take significantly longer. She didn\'t particularly mind, though---it was only a couple of hours either way. Unfortunately, the other personnel on board were not great company, so she spent much of the time reading up on alien point defenses, or otherwise looking out a window. Cloud cover obscured the ground most of the trip, but occasional gaps allowed her to see the world below. It had always amazed her in the past, to see below her such large, empty tracts of land, devoid of human habitation. Even on Earth, that had been possible, but those views had been from the interior of a scramjet, looking down on a world that was nearly round. Of course, it had always been possible to zoom in, but it didn\'t seem quite the same.

The views here were subtly different from Earth, too. Ground a slightly different shade of green, perhaps a different pattern to the vegetation, sky a different shade of blue, and, of course, a completely alien landscape when you inspected your location on the map.

She felt strangely pensive, out there alone in an alien sky. Something still seemed missing, and, without anyone to talk to---inessential transmissions from within an aircraft were highly discouraged---she couldn\'t help but think of the impending mission.

Then, finally, they approached their destination, and she couldn\'t help but think of it as a relief.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, Ryouko arrived at her destination, requisitioning transport in the same way she had the plane---simply getting on board whatever was going the right way. Outside of active combat zones, where alien interference with supply and logistics was a constant concern, military supply was a smoothly‐oiled machine; travel was usually an experience in listening carefully to your TacComp and doing exactly what it said. It seemed, though, that an officer traveling alone, on not‐quite‐official business, was expected to make do with what she could. She supposed it made sense.

The town she was in had an entirely different feel from Acheron. It seemed depleted---the storefronts closed, the advertisements powered off, and the streets quiet. Coupled with the military personnel around every corner, the armored vehicles in the streets, and the drones in the air, it was readily apparent that the colony had been mostly evacuated, and was operating under martial law. The occasional heavily damaged or ruined building, the result of brief air raids or bouts of orbital artillery, helped contribute to the ambiance.

So too did the rain.

She paused on the threshold of the building. Looking up at the extravagant arch and stucco edifice of \"Loch Ness Hospital and Enhancement Center\", she reflected on how strange it seemed, having a hospital occupy an entire building. The architecture was unfamiliar to her, but she suspected the edifice was intended to look imposing, or at the very least large. It failed to have that effect on her, used as she was to Earth, even as it dripped water down towards her head.

Plastered just outside the entrance of the building was an animated poster that it seemed no one had decided to take down. \"Mikki\" the magical girl seemed to really want you to buy a hair product that would "increase the contractile force of your hair strands two‐fold!\"

*I could have used something like that a long time ago,* Ryouko thought, scanning the face of the girl on the poster for an identity, *But I\'m not really sure why anyone would buy it just because \'Mikki\' says so.*

Behind her, her hair twitched, shaking off some of the water. She had been ignoring the water, which was after all irrelevant, since even her clothes cleaned themselves. One of the aftereffects of the training was a certain... disregard for things like that. She wondered what her friends would think of that.

*It\'s called endorsement,* Clarisse thought. *People are more likely to buy things they remember, and they are more likely to remember things associated with someone they recognize. So they pay Mikki some currency and she agrees to show up on some advertising. It\'s one way to make money, I suppose. Her service record lists her as \'deceased\', though. I suppose it must be an old poster.*

Ryouko thought about that.

*Speaking of which, I should probably put some consideration into what I should do with my spare Allocs,* she thought, choosing not to focus on the last part of what Clarisse had said. *You have any thoughts on the matter?*

*As a matter of fact, yes. I don\'t think right now is the moment to bring it up, though. Something seems off about this situation.*

*Hmm? What do you mean?* Ryouko asked.

*The information I have states that your grandfather was assigned to a field hospital, not something like this, in a relatively secure urban area. This is a more heavily specialized facility, for difficult cases, and also does clone restoration for magical girls. With all due respect, I don\'t think your grandfather had the qualifications for that. And despite my efforts, I still can\'t locate his personnel record.*

*You might be overthinking it,* Ryouko thought, though it did bother her. *Let\'s stop lingering and go inside.*

In the first sign of real coordination and logistics since she had gotten off *HSS Raven,* a pleasant‐looking young woman, in her early‐twenties by physical age, stepped out to greet her as she walked in.

###### \"*Chiyo Noriko*\" 

-   **Age: Occupation:** *Magical Girl (active service): Psychiatrist, MHD Rank:** *Colonel Classification:** *Telepath*

*A psychiatrist?* Ryouko thought, surprised.

\"Good afternoon,\" the woman said, in Japanese. \"I want to convey Atsuko‐san\'s regards for not being able to come personally. It is difficult to be everywhere at once, and for certain situations we think it is better to have a human touch, rather than involve a virtuality.\"

\"Situation?\" Ryouko asked. Her hair twitched once more, as if in accordance with her mood, shaking off some remnants of water.

The woman gave her a level gaze, gauging her, then said:

\"While you were traveling here, your grandfather suffered a rather serious injury. While it is not life‐endangering, it is possible his appearance would be distressing. Had you not already been on your way, we would have in honesty canceled the whole affair. As it is, I am here to, well, monitor you. Nothing in your record suggests something like this would affect you seriously, but caution might well be the better part of valor.\"

Ryouko\'s eyes widened, and she felt a sliver of fear run its way through her veins.

\"Injured?\" she asked, voice slightly panicky. \"How? Are there any permanent ramifications?\"

By permanent ramifications, she meant substantial brain damage. Enough time properly tubed up in a regeneration tank could recover even a normal human from little more than a head, but actual damage to the brain---well, even if the surgeons could repair that, there was a good chance the person might come back with an altered personality, or lost memories. Muscle, ligament, and bone were relatively unimportant. It was information* that could not be lost. Well, except when it came to magical healing, but that... depended on the quality of the healing, and there wasn\'t enough to go around.

It occurred to Ryouko for the first time that having a TacComp might be useful for something like that.

\"Thankfully, no,\" Noriko said, addressing the more important of her questions first. \"An alien raiding party temporarily compromised zone defenses in the area where he was working, and he was the recipient of an unfortunately timed shell. He will be fine.\"

Ryouko thought that Noriko was strangely... clinical, for a psychiatrist. She would have expected a much gentler approach. She wondered if that reflected on the woman\'s personality, or if her file suggested that this was how people should talk to her. Perhaps both.

*You\'re standing there with your mouth literally hanging open, Clarisse pointed out. Ryouko clamped it shut, perhaps with too much force.

\"Good,\" she said, acting calm with an effort. \"That\'s what\'s important. I hope it\'s not too distressing of an injury for him.\"

The woman smiled slightly.

\"He\'s taking it well, I would say. The records on you were correct. Come on, let\'s go have a look at him. I\'ll forward the injury description to your TacComp.\"

Ryouko reviewed a body map of the injuries as they walked, and grimaced internally. Two missing legs and multiple shrapnel wounds to the abdomen. She---well, she had seen a lot during training, and knew very well that he\'d be right back to full duty within a week, but she did not look forward to seeing this. Her mother was probably throwing a fit, assuming she knew.

She found Kuroi Abe a short while later, sitting up out of his bed to greet their arrival. He was alone in a small, personal room, decorated by a single impressionist‐style painting hanging over his head and a false window that displayed a video feed of the city outside. The wall on the far end was displaying one of those ever popular military \"War Reports\", favored among the rank‐and‐file for their ironically self‐aware propagandistic style. A set of white tubes ran out from under the blanket her grandfather was using to cover his lower half. The tubes snaked over the side of the bed, seeming to fuse directly into the material that composed the wall.

\"They didn\'t tell you me you\'d be visiting, or I\'d have gone out to meet you,\" her grandfather said, leaning forward to peer at her more closely. \"Chiyo‐san here showed up out of the blue, asked me some questions, and suddenly she says she\'s going to be bringing my granddaughter in.\"

\"Questions? Really?\"

\"Oh, nothing important.\"

\"*She wanted to know what I thought your sexual orientation was,*\" her grandfather transmitted silently, keeping his face carefully unchanged.

\"*Really?*\" Ryouko asked, suddenly feeling uncomfortable.

\"*Did something happen?*\"

Ryouko kept her face calm with an effort.

\"*She\'s a mind‐reader, granddad. She can\'t read these transmissions, but I\'m pretty sure she can still hear you.*\"

Her grandfather looked slightly chagrined.

\"Well, I didn\'t know what exactly I\'d be visiting either,\" Ryouko said, glancing over at the woman, who showed no signs of, for example, leaving to give them privacy. She was suddenly unsure whether or not she liked the MHD. Among other things, she was certain the question had something to do with Asami, but how did they even know about that?

Kuroi Abe looked thoughtful for a moment, looking at the general vicinity of his legs.

\"Want to see it?\" he asked, abruptly.

\"See it?\" Ryouko echoed.

The man began pulling the blanket off his legs.

\"Are you sure this is a good idea, Kuroi‐san?\" Noriko asked, sounding skeptical. \"She---\"

\"Bah, she\'s made of tougher stuff than that,\" he insisted, catching the meaning instantly.

A moment later, Ryouko found out what the tubes were for, wincing slightly. The missing legs, one severed just above the knee and the other just below the thigh, were encased in what appeared to be two separate, leg‐shaped molds, sheathed in a murky layer of blue. A set of nutrient feeds and waste tubes ran into both, which already carried numerous bulbous, cellular growths from where the doctors had seeded the scaffold. The intact parts of the legs sprouted similar pink masses, large fibrous tracts infiltrating downward into the mold.

She assumed whatever abdominal injuries he may have had were covered by the shirt he was wearing. It wasn\'t exactly a pleasant sight, but at least nothing was actively bleeding, and she had seen plenty worse in the simulations.

\"I can\'t look at the way it grows without being reminded of some kind of horrible tumor,\" her grandfather commented, looking at his leg.

\"What?\" Ryouko asked.

\"Before your time,\" Abe said.

\"Before your time too,\" Noriko pointed out.

\"I was a physician,\" Abe insisted, waving his hand dismissively. \"We learned about it. It\'s interesting: even though I knew it wouldn\'t kill me, it\'s really hard to convince yourself of that when you\'re looking at a decimeter hole in your abdomen, you can\'t feel your legs, and your consciousness is slipping away.\"

They stayed silent for an uncomfortable moment. Ryouko stared at the regrowing legs with a kind of morbid fascination, while the psychiatrist stared at Ryouko instead. Her grandfather looked at a wall, realizing he\'d described things a little too colorfully.

\"If you don\'t mind,\" he said, covering his legs and looking at the psychiatrist. \"We\'d like some privacy.\"

\"Certainly,\" Noriko said, bowing fluidly. \"Send me a message when you\'re done here, Shizuki‐san.\"

The woman left, the door sliding closed behind her.

\"Do you think she\'s listening in, telepathically?\" Ryouko asked, a moment later.

\"It\'s not worth worrying too much about,\" Abe said. \"I hear you got a promotion? And a medal?\"

Ryouko felt suddenly uncomfortable.

\"Ah, yes,\" she said. \"Yes. For uh---\"

\"Your mother knew about the transport incident the whole time, you know,\" her grandfather said, leaning in and speaking quietly, even though there was no reason to. \"She has connections. It\'s not good to lie to your mother, though.\"

Ryouko felt herself make a confused expression.

\"But---\" she began.

\"She didn\'t want you to know she could keep track of you,\" her grandfather said. \"I\'m telling you now because, really, you guys need to work on this talking thing. I\'ve had too many bad experiences stemming from poor communication.\"

The man met her eyes, giving her a serious look.

Ryouko thought back to her mother, her mother\'s sister, and her grandmother, and grimaced slightly.

\"Alright,\" she said, unsure if she was being sincere.

Her grandfather looked skeptical, but didn\'t press the point.

\"So, uh, how was the training and deployment?\" she asked. \"You know, before the injury.\"

His face darkened slightly, which surprised her.

\"It\'s an experience,\" he said, looking away from her, toward the far wall, which was playing footage of an alien armored column.

\"It\'s mostly about stabilization, you know,\" he clarified, a moment. "And there\'s no screaming at all. Above a certain threshold, the cortical implants isolate the pain centers, and there\'s always combat mode to rely on, assuming the TacComp is still intact. If the cortex senses that continued standard operation is impossible, everything goes into a fugue‐like state. Average planetary survival is about fifteen hours, but people have come back from as much as two weeks. It depends on how cold it is.\"

Ryouko shifted awkwardly. Her grandfather was still palpably the same person, with the same vague sense of self‐assurance, but he had never previously been prone to giving too much detail. That was more the kind of problem she and her mother had.

\"Ah, I\'m talking too much,\" he said, self‐correcting. \"Well, anyway, it\'s sort of interesting. We mostly get the cases that need immediate stabilization. Everything else is either too minor to bother or can be forwarded to reconstruction. We just get row after row of fugued‐out bodies, never bleeding, even though there\'s usually plenty of blood. A lot of the time, we get people who are still in their armor---often, the armor is the only thing keeping them alive. Sometimes we can do enough to get their bodies running again. Sometimes, we have to install them into a regeneration tank on the spot. Sometimes we have to ask for the magical healer. Sometimes we can\'t do anything.\"

Abe tilted his head slightly, looking at her out of one eye. It was an appraising look, judging how she was taking it. Her grandfather had always been a little different from her parents---a lot more willing to talk about things, for instance, and sometimes she suspected he did it as a form of education. She appreciated it, for what that was worth.

In this case, she was relatively unaffected. She was already fairly well‐versed in the relevant details, and even beyond that, she found it difficult to react emotionally to the mere recitation of facts. She had to see it, at the very least, and even then she was level‐headed---or so she believed, anyway.

\"Still, it\'s good to know you\'re saving lives,\" the man said. \"I\'d missed that feeling, after I retired.\"

He tilted his head downward, hand to mouth, as if thinking about something.

\"Anyway, enough about that topic,\" he said. \"Let\'s talk about something else. For instance, I\'d still like to know what the psychiatrist was asking about.\"

\"What?\" Ryouko asked, having genuinely lost her bearing in the conversation.

Her grandfather knitted his forehead, deciding how to word the question.

\"I don\'t want to pry,\" he said, \"though I guess that\'s exactly what I\'m doing. I just don\'t think the MHD would show up to ask me about, of all things, your sexual orientation for no reason at all. She asked other things, too. I just wondered if you wanted to talk. It\'s alright if you don\'t.\"

Ryouko cast her eyes downward.

\"I---\"

She paused, wondering what to say. A part of her wished that Clarisse would interject, and thus make it all easier---but of course, the device remained silent. As Clarisse had implied, in the end she had to speak for herself.

\"Did Chiyo‐san mention to you why I\'m suddenly coming to visit you now?\" she asked, quietly.

The man gave her a careful look.

\"I don\'t think so,\" he said. \"She never really explained. I had assumed that if you were going to visit, they would pull me off the line ahead of time, but I figured that getting my legs blown off must have just happened at a really bad time. The way you bring this up, though, makes me think there\'s something special about it.\"

\"Well, I can\'t really talk about it,\" she said, sighing, \"but I\'ve drawn a special combat assignment. It\'s... well, pretty dangerous. And the thing is, this girl I know wants to have a relationship, but I--I don\'t know if I\'m interested in things like that. I don\'t want to refuse her and regret it, but at the same time, I don\'t want to end up stringing her along. Worse, I might not come back from this mission. I don\'t want to say nothing before, because I might not get another chance, but I don\'t want to start something and then die immediately, to be blunt about it. I---it makes my life so much harder, and I can\'t shake the feeling that I\'m obsessing over some trivial teenage problem. And of course, if I botch it too badly, it could literally threaten the other girl\'s life, given the whole soul gem‐emotional state thing.\"

Once she got started, the words came with surprising fluidity, so that at the end of it she found herself surprisingly calm, waiting for some sort of response from her grandfather.

The man in question was staring at the far wall again, with distant eyes.

Finally, he smiled weakly.

\"This is the kind of thing that reminds me of how your mother feels. It\'s something I understand. I---well, I can\'t say I have a perfect answer, but in complicated situations like this, it often works to just explain the situation. People are usually understanding, and she\'s probably more resilient than you think.\"

It was Ryouko\'s turn to smile weakly.

\"I can explain it, sure,\" she said. \"But then what do I say after that?\"

Kuroi Abe shrugged.

\"That\'s for you to decide. The only instruction I can really give you is not to die. I think we would all vastly prefer that.\"

He met her eyes, and she stared back for a moment. At that moment, she couldn\'t help but be reminded of the Kuroi Matriarch saying the same thing, only a day ago.

\"If possible,\" she said, finally.

Her grandfather closed his eyes, nodding.

\"You know, I managed to talk to your grandmother again,\" he said, turning away to retrieve something from within his personal bag.

\"Though not in person, of course,\" he finished, when he sat back up again.

\"How was it?\" she asked, when he failed to add anything further.

\"Same as always,\" he said.

He held up the item he had retrieved, which Ryouko now saw was a ring.

\"I\'ve got my own problems,\" he said, putting the ring into a shirt pocket. \"But she wants to talk to you.\"

\"I don\'t think I have time before the mission,\" Ryouko said, it suddenly occurring to her to wonder why it had been arranged for her to visit her grandfather on the planet surface, and not her grandmother in the shipyard.

Kuroi Abe nodded.

\"Let\'s watch some propaganda for a while, then,\" he said.

She stayed there for a while, leaning her head into her grandfather\'s chest, watching explosions happen what seemed a world away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Cover me!* Nadya Antipova demanded, voice filled with angry urgency. Pulling one of these damn things out of the sky isn\'t paddy‐cakes! I need someone to keep the fire off me!*

*Have some damned patience,* Zheng Ying‐zhi, their barrier generator, answered, tersely. *I\'m getting on it.*

It made quite a sight, the raven‐haired team leader Nadya in her crimson, uniform‐like costume, reaching upwards with gloved hand, trying to pull an alien sky defense station---a \"flying fortress\"---out of its sky. Nadya was reputedly the strongest telekinetic alive, but a flying fortress was *enormous,* and from where they stood underneath it, it blocked out the sun and a good portion of the sky. The bulbous, massive structure, with its protruding spherical spires, looked like a Daliesque interpretation of an underwater castle, and was hardly aerodynamic---but of course it didn\'t have to be, since it had antigrav generators on a scale beyond the imagination of even the most ambitious human engineers.

Another way to put it was that it was basically an atmospheric version of an alien cruiser, but that sounded less poetic.

Despite their firepower, though, this class of vessel had one feature that kept them away from the front lines, serving instead as area denial stations. They were, in essence, giant sitting ducks, incapable of taking a sustained assault from heavy ground weapons.

There Nadya stood, among the smoking ruins of an alien point defense system and the scattered limbs of its infantry garrison. Next to her, Ying‐zhi crouched on the ground, scowling as she aimed her *chu‐ko‐nu at targets in the sky. Above and around them, her shimmering golden barrier deflected both incoming fire and the never‐diminishing swarms of alien attack drones.

Two other girls focused on damaging the fortress\'s generators remotely, Misa Virani, face full of concentration, summoning lightning bolts out of the clear blue sky, the other, Annabelle Smith, squinting down the barrel of her sniper rifle, of the magical, laser‐firing kind.

In the midst of the chaos, Ryouko crouched on the ground under Ying‐zhi\'s golden barrier, watching her soul gem dump its corruption in a handful of grief cubes. The teleport in, her first combat use of her maximal range, had taken a lot out of her, obliging her to stay in place recharging her soul gem, staying out of combat as she gathered energy for the trip back. They had practiced before this, but Ryouko hadn\'t realized how strangely useless it would make her feel to stay in place doing nothing while the others did the heavy lifting.

Even if she had possessed the energy to do more, she seriously doubted that the rest of the team would have allowed her. The rookie teleporter was both too powerful and too untrained to be allowed to risk herself.

As a bit of a practice mission, they had been assigned to destroy an underground airship production facility, located roughly under the spot where they were currently standing. Indeed, calling it a practice mission seemed a bit of a misnomer---the only distinction from a real mission was the fact that the assignment had been carefully chosen so as to maximally test some of their abilities, without exposing them to unwarranted levels of danger.

At the moment, it would have helped immensely if they had some trees to give them cover, but they didn\'t, nor did they have an illusion generator with them. Instead, they were standing on a large empty patch of ground, surrounded by sparse vegetation. It was exactly what one would expect out of an airfield, in other words, at least one that was large enough so as not to be worth trying to camouflage.

*Have you found it yet?* Nadya demanded again, addressing Gracia Perez, their telepath‐clairvoyant, who crouched on the ground nearby. Accompanying her were three other girls: Juliet François, Mina Guyure---their other teleporter---and Eva Guderian, all of whom were staying inactive, saving power. Eva was a bit of a novelty: she could make any non‐living object she touched with her primary weapon explode and, rather appropriately, her primary weapon was a prehensile whip that was capable of being extended to enormous length.

*I\'m still looking!* the clairvoyant responded, tightly, devoting only a minor fraction of her attention to her response. *This isn\'t that easy! Also, stealth infantry approaching on the ground.*

Before she even finished the thought, the others responded to the markers appearing on their internal maps. Annabelle squeezed off a series of shots, and Misa lifted up the metal debris, using a burst of electricity to fire them as projectiles. Unlike Nadya, she didn\'t have a penchant for expressive hand and arm gestures, preferring to stand nearly still, almost stoically, as she channeled her powers. Unless she was forced to move, of course.

The markers disappeared, removed by their clairvoyant, and the other two girls returned to dispatching drones.

*I wish everyone used mechanical controls instead of this electrical stuff,* Nadya complained. *Much easier to flip a switch than to jam the engine mechanisms from this distance.*

*Oh please,* Misa thought, combative as ever. *As if you have that kind of precision.*

*Do you doubt me? It\'s not as if your lightning is doing anything!*

Nadya jerked her arms out of the air dramatically, as if pulling on an invisible rope, long hair flopping behind her back as she spun slightly, arms swinging behind her. She looked up expectantly, like a batter who had just hit what she expected to be a homerun.

The near end of the fortress exploded---or, speaking specifically, one of the larger bulbs shattered in slow motion, sending out pieces of debris that tumbled slowly and eerily through the air, before finally starting to head downward.

The structure as a whole shuddered---but it didn\'t fall.

*That\'s generator number three,* Nadya thought, both relieved that she had actually succeeded and annoyed that the ship hadn\'t started falling. *I can\'t believe that thing\'s still in the air!*

With another, almost casual gesture of her hands, a set of missiles descending on their position spun out of their trajectories, impacting with the cloud of drones that was constantly bombarding their position.

*Incoming,* Gracia warned, the texture of her thought unreasonably clinical given what was about to happen.

The sky above them, previously dominated by the fortress, turned into a blinding, pure white. Ying‐zhi visibly struggled with the effort of keeping the barrier intact, dropping into a kneel, face strained. The ground around them seared away, the soil visibly getting lower by the moment, clumps of liquefying soil seeming to float off the surface briefly before disintegrating.

*I thought the heavy laser cannons were destroyed!* she thought accusingly.

*That\'s what I thought!* Nadya responded, reaching upward again. *I don\'t know where they got more!*

The light faded abruptly, leaving Nadya blinking in surprise. The ground stopped vaporizing before their eyes, instead presenting them with a smoking, blackened surface, baked eerily smooth, except for the wide circle they were standing on, which they could now see was several centimeters higher than the area around them.

\"Never call me useless,\" Misa growled, looking unexpectedly insulted by Nadya\'s previous comment regarding her lightning.

They could now see that the formerly cloaked cannon had been shattered, metal fragments floating slowly outward in the fortress\'s antigrav fields. The pieces continued to discharge static as they tumbled.

\"I wasn\'t---\" Nadya began.

*Got it!* Gracia thought, seeming to finally wake up from her self‐induced trance.

Without any further prelude, the four of them---Mina, Gracia, Juliet, and Eva---vanished, Mina teleporting them to the alien base\'s deep underground production facilities, its location finally identified.

The ground underneath them shook as the team went to work. A moment later, with a grunt, Nadya went back to work on the fortress above them, trying to disable a fourth generator.

A few moments later---roughly seventeen seconds, according to Ryouko\'s chronometer---the four‐person demolition squad reappeared on the surface.

*We\'re done here,* Gracia thought, walking towards Ryouko. *Let\'s go.*

Her thought had an air of finality to it.

Nadya visibly strained, making one last try at taking down the alien airship.

*Leave it, Nadya!* Misa thought, tone bordering on insubordination. There\'ll be other chances.*

With obvious reluctance, Nadya dropped her arms, turning and heading for Ryouko, face annoyed. She took one last look upward at the flying fortress, obviously damaged---among other things, it was still visibly venting smoke from several massive holes---but still defiantly afloat.

When they had all reached her, Ryouko took a breath, and reached in deeply for the required power...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"But I still don\'t understand why it\'s funny,\" Ryouko said, giving the girl next to her a queer look.

\"They all thought she was German the whole time,\" Mina explained, "but of course she\'s Dutch. So when one of them made a Hitler joke, it set her off.\"

\"But that\'s *terrible,*\" Ryouko said. \"Look how distressed she is.\"

\"Of course it sounds terrible if you make me explain it like that,\" Mina said, exasperated. \"But it was obviously funny.\"

\"Give it up already, Mina,\" Eva said, rolling her eyes and looking bored. \"Her personnel file says she doesn\'t get humor. Let\'s get back to the damn movie.\"

They were watching a movie in their newly assigned house, within a former civilian living complex deep in one of the secure areas of the planet. More precisely, they were watching *Historian,* a century‐old MSY biopic about the MSY\'s most famous historian, Clarisse van Rossum, that of course Ryouko had seen before. Even more precisely, while they were physically within Eva\'s room, they were watching the movie within an accelerated virtuality, to save time within their crammed, self‐assigned training schedule. They were about to start serious simulation training, practicing *in silico* for both the insertion onto the moon and the mission afterward. The intelligence available about the layout of the alien facility was limited, so they would be running through various scenarios based on the layout of other captured alien structures, exotic and novel to the human sense of aesthetics.

In contrast to that, the virtuality they were currently in was a comparatively dull replication of one of the rooms they were staying in, where they were seated watching the movie play on the back wall. They could have opted for something more immersive, such as a movie theatre‐style \"inside the movie\" experience, but the whole point of the exercise was team‐bonding, and it was difficult to do that if you couldn\'t see each other, or if the main characters were constantly walking around you.

Besides, everyone knew that the pure \"in‐head\" experience was inferior to what you could get with movie theatre equipment, or specialized computing resources, such as had been on board the Zhukov. If they had wanted to watch a lower‐quality implant‐generated virtuality, they could have done it on their own time, without the need to gather everyone.

Amazing, how quickly a technology like that could become routine. After all, Ryouko hadn\'t had any access in her civilian life.

\"My personnel file says that?\" Ryouko asked incredulously.

\"It says a lot of things,\" Eva said. \"Look, it\'s not important. Let\'s just get back to the watching, okay?\"

Ryouko felt an elbow in her side, and turned to find Juliet giving her a narrow look. She should let it go, the look said, and Ryouko even received a slight bit of telepathically‐conveyed annoyance.

Juliet wasn\'t much for talking.

Ryouko let it go, leaning back against the sofa behind her, which was made up of those self‐assembling modular furniture pieces that were so popular on Earth. Next to her, Misa sat upside‐down on the sofa itself, her head inclined over the edge to watch the movie, long hair draping onto the floor, while her bare feet were planted into the wall behind them. Ryouko wasn\'t sure how exactly the girl could be comfortable "seated\" like that, but by now she knew better than to question the eccentricities of centenarians.

\"Now that you\'re here, you might as well stay,\" the on‐screen version of Tomoe Mami said, framed within the boundaries of the wall, holography giving the scene the illusion of depth. \"We could use your experience and power.\"

Misa paused the movie, as Nadya entered the simulation, choosing to enter through the virtual door instead of just materializing in thin air.

\"Sorry I\'m late,\" the team elder said. \"Had some things to take care of. I hope I haven\'t missed too much. And Misa, really, you could stand to show some decency every once in a while.\"

\"It\'s not like I\'m doing this in reality,\" Misa said. \"Stop being such a stick in the mud.\"

Nadya grunted at the ancient idiom, before seating herself into an empty slot on the sofa. The movie resumed.

\"I\'d be glad to stay,\" the movie version of Van Rossum said, \"but sadly that\'s not how it works for me. Now that everything is over, I have to get going.\"

At that moment, in almost eerie synchrony, everyone in the room lost their focus on the movie, body language clearly signaling that they were reading some sort of urgent internal message.

The movie paused again, as Eva groaned at the arrival of yet another interruption.

\"A new team member?\" she asked rhetorically, in annoyance and disbelief. \"At this stage? What is command thinking? No offense to you, Ryouko, but it\'s been hard enough integrating one new member---\"

\"Not just any new member,\" Nadya said, voice hushed, looking back up at the screen. \"It\'s---\"

\"Clarisse van Rossum,\" Ryouko said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a brief bout of hurried discussion, they decided that it wasn\'t worth trying to hide their awe and surprise: they would travel out to the city starport---which now served as a military airfield---and greet her as she got off the transport. It had been sudden; even Mami had conceded as much in her message to the team. The message explained that Clarisse had filed an unexpected and sudden personal appeal, requesting Mami to assign an escort for her to a particular moon of the gas giant Orpheus. Something big was going to happen there, Clarisse had been sure, even if she couldn\'t explain what.

The MSY was not in the habit of denying Clarisse\'s requests. There had been a lengthy discussion, in which Clarisse had insisted that it was essential she be on the moon itself, at the allotted time.

But there was only one way that was possible.

As they headed out in their roomy group vehicle, they speculated wildly on what this new development meant for them, their mission, and humanity as a whole.

\"Van Rossum travels all the time,\" Nadya said. \"She has the luxury of her own ship, nowadays. That doesn\'t mean every place she visits is important. It\'s not every day you can have an Asunción or St. Petersburg. But this smells big. We all know our mission is important. This just emphasizes it.\"

\"Is she a good fighter?\" Eva asked, leaning back in her seat. \"I mean, I know about the movies and such, but you know how they blow things out of proportion.\"

\"She\'s five and a half centuries old,\" Ying‐zhi said severely, long hair falling over her eyes as she leaned forward, \"and she lived through times that were a lot worse for our kind than anything that followed. She *must* be a good fighter.\"

\"Even among girls my age, very few have seen her fight,\" Nadya said. "Except for a few obligation demons every year, she mostly just glides along. The last time she did any fighting of note was during the Unification Wars, and I\'m at least half a century too young to have seen that. Yes, I know, amazing.\"

She glanced sternly at Misa, who had been clearly about to make a snarky comment about Nadya\'s age.

\"Anyway, I\'m as curious as the rest of you,\" Nadya finished. \"They say that normally she has very little power, but the closer she gets to an event of major historical importance, the greater her power gets.\"

\"She\'s a member of the Church\'s Theological Council,\" Gracia said thoughtfully. \"They say... that is, the rumors say she interferes in historical events, at the Goddess\'s direction. The left hand of the Goddess, in other words.\"

At her side, Juliet nodded sagely, but Mina made a face and said:

\"The Goddess does not interfere in worldly affairs so rudely. What happens is predetermined. It does not make sense---\"

\"Okay, let\'s not have this discussion right now,\" Misa said, cutting the other girl off with an outstretched arm. \"Your cult can argue about this on your own time. What I want to discuss is how this affects our chances of success on the mission.\"

\"There\'s speculation that the nature of her wish makes her immortal as long as humanity survives,\" Ryouko said thoughtfully. \"Since after all, one can\'t witness history if one is dead. If true, it could improve our odds.\"

Seeing skeptical looks, Ryouko appended:

\"Well, I read it online.\"

She shrugged to indicate that she was just stating it as a matter of speculation.

Annabelle chuckled slightly.

\"Or I suppose it could mean that this mission is about to fail in the most catastrophic way possible,\" she said.

\"How is one mission supposed to destroy all of humanity?\" Misa said. "At worst, it fails catastrophically and we all die, but Clarisse survives somehow.\"

\"You are both too cynical and too morbid,\" Nadya said. \"Don\'t scare the new girl. Look, she\'s turning pale.\"

Ryouko was not, in fact, turning pale, but she decided she should try to play along, casting her eyes to one side. It probably wasn\'t a good acting job.

\"Anyway,\" she said, an awkward moment later, \"what I\'ve never understood is, if she\'s supposed to witness all of history, how is she supposed to see anything from before she was born?\"

\"Let\'s not overthink this,\" Nadya said. \"Whatever the case, she\'s here, so let\'s work together to try to make this a successful mission, okay?\"

They responded to the platitude with various assenting noises, though the discussion persisted, and Mina, Gracia, and Juliet continued to glare daggers at each other, probably still arguing the topic via either telepathy or transmission.

*Do you want to introduce yourself to Clarisse?* Ryouko asked her TacComp.

*As tempting as that sounds,* the TacComp in question responded, *I think it\'d be better if I didn\'t, since you\'re keeping me sort of a secret from your team here. Also, are you sure you want to admit to her that you named me after her?*

*You named* yourself *after her,* Ryouko said, slightly miffed.

*Sure I did.*

Ryouko decided to leave Clarisse out of any upcoming conversations with... Clarisse.

Instead of stopping outside the starport, their vehicle caromed down a newly opened access road onto the landing area itself, though they were obliged to step off near the entrance, far from the designated loading areas, and watch their vehicle drive off.

Ryouko took a moment to take in their surroundings. The gray surface below her feet appeared identical to the material that paved the ground surfaces of Mitakihara City---it probably *was* identical, she decided, though she wasn\'t about to test it by deliberately falling and seeing if the surface softened briefly.

Like Acheron, Apollo was a hot planet, befitting its name, but whereas Acheron had been an inferno, Apollo was at that moment merely hot. It was high summer, but compared to Acheron, Apollo was positively pleasant, even if they happened to be near the unpleasantly warm equator.

The city they were in, Waset, lay at the edge of one of the planet\'s many sandstone deserts. Consequently, the air smelled faintly of dust, of sandstone baking under the sun.

Well, according to her enhanced sense of smell, it was actually dust, thruster exhaust, three different types of plant pollen, permacrete, Eva\'s slightly obnoxious perfume, and the odors of no less than eight different humans---female, around her age.

Dust was the most prominent, though.

They walked over to the designated landing point, standing carefully out of the way of where her ship would descend. Ryouko watched expectantly as the frigate‐class ship descended out of the clear blue‐violet sky, braking its initially fiery descent on thrusters and antigravity. For a starship it looked unusually aerodynamic, even sporting diminutive wing stubs. Like all small ships that might venture into hostile territory, it was covered in a metamaterial sheath that helped the ship blend into its background, though without additional stealth enhancements, it did little more than make it less conspicuous.

As the ship settled into a gentle almost‐vertical landing, wheels coming to a rest on the gray permacrete ground, Ryouko thought back to the matronly, nondescript woman who had questioned her at the Theological Council meeting. It was hard to believe she was finally going to meet her.

It was thus a substantial surprise when what appeared to be a teenager stepped onto the descent ladder, wavy hair and pretty freckled face complementing fashionable white dress and blue shirt. As she watched, the girl stretched luxuriously, bulky travel bag at her side.

The girl saw Ryouko looking and grinned, descending rapidly down the steps, bag dutifully walking itself down the steps after her.

\"I\'m Clarisse van Rossum,\" she said as she reached the bottom step, bowing gracefully. \"Though I suppose it\'s a bit old‐fashioned to be giving my name, now isn\'t it? It\'s been a long time since I\'ve been this young. I\'d forgotten how much more energetic you feel. It\'s the better combat form, you know, so once I knew I\'d be doing something like this, I figured I\'d better make the change.\"

The group stared back at her blankly, except Nadya, who looked thoughtful. The team leader reached into the gift bag she had been carrying, extracting a large glass bottle filled with a clear transparent fluid. Before Ryouko could endeavor to move her head so she could read the front side of the Russian label, Nadya stepped forward, presenting the bottle, looking self‐satisfied.

\"Oooh,\" Clarisse chorused melodiously, looking impressed. "Non‐synthesized vodka. High-quality too. Oh, Nadya, you shouldn\'t have!\"

The two girls embraced warmly, as the eyes of the rest of the group collectively grew wider.

\"How did you get something like this so quickly?\" Clarisse asked, looking the other girl in the eye, hands still on her shoulders.

\"I always have some stashed for special occasions,\" Nadya said confidently, smiling.

\"Then let\'s save it for after the mission,\" Clarisse said, \"to celebrate victory. But surely we can drink some of the synthesized stuff tonight, when we have time. It\'ll be bonding.\"

\"Certainly.\"

\"You know her!\" Misa blurted out finally, the first to speak.

Nadya turned and looked at the rest of them, raising an eyebrow.

\"Well, yes,\" she said simply.

\"But you said---\"

\"I said I\'ve never seen her fight,\" Nadya said. \"Not that I didn\'t know her. You girls always underestimate me. You don\'t live two centuries without meeting a few people.\"

Clarisse pursed her lips.

\"It\'s not nice to toy with your juniors like that, Nadya,\" she criticized. \"Come on, I\'ll introduce myself.\"

To Ryouko\'s surprise, Clarisse headed directly for her, hand outstretched.

\"I do believe we\'ve met before, after a fashion,\" she said, \"And here you are again. You\'re an interesting girl.\"

Ryouko shook the hand hesitantly, meeting the woman\'s---girl\'s---eyes with confusion. Surely, Clarisse couldn\'t be talking about the Theological Council encounter---but what else could she mean?

Ryouko glanced away from the other girl\'s eyes, looking down at the floor. She had spent so much of her childhood reading about Clarisse\'s exploits that she seemed almost a mythological figure to her. Now that she was here, shaking her hand, she didn\'t know what to say.

\"Her too?\" Misa asked incredulously.

Ryouko looked at the rest of the team, and found the team\'s Cult members---Juliet, Mina, and Gracia---looking at her with both surprise and sudden interest. Unlike Selécine, they had no idea about Ryouko\'s visions and previous contact with the Cult, possibly due to the secrecy surrounding the team.

Clarisse moved through the rest of the team, shaking hands and smiling charmingly. It was almost unnatural for a girl who looked so young to exude so much charisma, but at this point Ryouko was beyond being surprised by that kind of thing. She was sure that Clarisse was at the point now where she could turn it on and off like a switch, similar to the other Ancients she had met. In fact, judging by the way some of the girls blushed, she was sure Clarisse could have gotten into someone\'s pants in record time, had that been her goal. Actually, come to think of it, what was Clarisse\'s sexual orientation anyway?

Ryouko frowned abruptly. The train of thought she had just completed...

*...is literally the dirtiest I\'ve ever heard out of you,* the other Clarisse opined. *It\'s unusual, you know. My preinstalled models were telling me to expect orders of magnitude more, at your age.*

*Was that comment really necessary?* Ryouko asked, rhetorically.

*I thought it was notable,* Clarisse responded. *It shows a certain growth, coming from you. Also, don\'t look now, but your idol is looking at you.*

Of course, Ryouko looked immediately, and found Clarisse giving her a thoughtful look. Seeing her looking, the girl smiled slightly.

The moment ended when Juliet appeared near Clarisse\'s shoulder, causing the historian to shift her gaze.

\"Your--your autograph,\" the soft‐spoken girl requested, obviously making a strenuous effort just to say the words.

Clarisse turned away to fulfill the request, as the others crowded nearby.

*Later,* the historian thought, and for a long moment Ryouko was unsure if the thought had been real, or if she had only just imagined it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite a strong group inclination to spend some more time socializing, both Nadya and Clarisse pointed out that time was starting to seriously run short. It was time to head to the city\'s specialized training center and start simulation training, and it was probably best that they socialize later, once they had completed their intended training and started the rest and relaxation period that would immediately precede departure. Unlike Ryouko, it was expected that Clarisse would blend in naturally with the team without an extensive preparation period, and could certainly be relied on to perform well in combat.

Despite her significant seniority, higher rank, and the evident willingness of *Major* Antipova to defer command to *Colonel* Van Rossum, the historian insisted that the operation was Nadya\'s to run, following orders readily. In addition, she felt obliged to add that:

\"As you all know, my power varies with how close I am to an important historical event. Because I fight so rarely, the system has only evaluated my powers during relatively weak periods, since I obviously didn\'t take time out for recordings when the situation was critical. We could have it guess at my power, but it might be better to practice with me weak.\"

Initially, she dazzled the others by performing feats that were normally never the provenance of a single magical girl, performing short‐range teleports, launching fireballs, and erecting magical barriers. As promised, however, it soon became clear that despite the variety of her powers, the simulation was making her weak---the teleports were invariably very short distance, and the fireballs were incapable of penetrating the shielding on alien armor.

Still, she was obviously very experienced, and next to her Ryouko felt almost inadequate. Occasionally, the old bloodlust came back, and she could lose herself in the heat of combat. More often, though, she found herself embarrassed. It wasn\'t that she performed poorly, not quite---but the rest of the team, even the newcomer Clarisse, was like a well‐oiled machine, anticipating orders before they arrived, eliminating threats before they had even had the chance to appear. Ryouko simply wasn\'t that good, and it bothered her.

And despite their skill, they still failed more missions than they succeeded, dying ignominiously in the middle of a randomly generated wormhole stabilizer layout.

Finally, they entered the most stressful of the simulations, the full immersion simulations---the ones they wouldn\'t know weren\'t real.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was so much enemy firepower, and the facility was just so big.

They were the only ones left. As a team, they were already critically wounded, missing one of their teleporters, their clairvoyant‐telepath, and a substantial portion of their grief cubes. At least they had managed to hold on to their PAYNE nuclear device.

On raids such as this, everything relied on mobility and deception. Cephalopod facilities were nowadays equipped with numerous redundant systems and countless decoys, designed to mislead MagOps teams. They had brought precision sensors, including gravimetric detectors, but it had hardly been a surprise when on initial entry, they found an array of no less than a dozen gravitational anomalies, each the potential location of a critical subsystem. It was tempting to teleport to the one directly under the massive ring above the facility, but experience showed that it was no more likely to be the right target than any of the others.

In the relatively cramped interior of such a major facility, the biggest danger was booby traps, directed explosives and hard radiation bombs pointed down clear lines‐of‐sight in literally every room, wired to fire regardless of whether any alien personnel were still in the area.

As such, they had to stay constantly on the move, probing new locations over and over, taking as unpredictable a course as possible. Anything less risked the squid turning on some kind of internal forcefield and detonating another antimatter explosive in their sector of the facility. It was doubtful that the aliens had another forcefield of such power, beyond the main forcefield protecting the exterior of the facility---and besides, even the aliens had to have some compunction about blowing a large part of their own facility sky‐high---but they couldn\'t afford to take chances.

But since Ryouko was the only remaining teleporter, the constant teleportation was starting to take its toll on her.

\"This isn\'t it,\" Nadya growled, as the results came back from the sensor pack on her back, salvaged from one of the other girls, now dead. Another decoy.

It was difficult to deny the abject disappointment that appeared on all their faces, as they stood nervously attentive in that vast cylindrical room. Around them lay the ruins of what had appeared to be an engineering observation room, littered with the corpses of alien personnel and shattered consoles. The austere metallic‐seeming walls were pitted with large blackened holes where Clarisse had barely managed to detect waiting traps. Behind a row of consoles was a row of windows, behind which a yawning spherical cavity carried a massive, floating gray sphere at least the size of a house. All for show, apparently.

The main entrance, circular in the alien style, was sealed shut by a massive radiation door, which Nadya had forced closed behind them. Beyond that door lay the smoking, radioactive ruins of the corridor they had entered from---and barely avoided death in. Back there Ying‐zhi had consumed everything she had left to save them, leaving behind not even a corpse.

*We have to hold it together. I know it\'s just the few of us left, but we still have a chance!*

Those words, which Misa murmured to the remaining group by telepathy, seemed designed to reassure herself more than anything. Still, Ryouko was glad to hear it, since her own faith was wavering.

*I haven\'t lived this long just to lose here,* Clarisse responded grimly, a moment later.

*If we can\'t find a good spot to place the PAYNE device, then we should at least endeavor to destroy as much as we can,* Nadya thought. *Who knows? Maybe we\'ll get a major reactor and delay activation for a week or so. That\'s got to be something. But for now, there\'s still five more locations to try.*

The other three moved quickly back towards Ryouko.

\"I can\'t sustain much more of this,\" Ryouko said, deliberately avoiding looking in the eyes of the others, whose eyes were wide with stress, and the strain of having to deal with the deaths of their team members. It was no coincidence that the survivors now consisted of the three oldest girls---and her. All along, she had been a burden on them. Not to mention, she didn\'t want to see in their eyes just how dire the situation was.

Clarisse\'s pack opened, the robotic arm disgorging a few grief cubes, which she tossed in Ryouko\'s direction. The sensors on her gem were registering low, and the team knew that.

Ryouko took a breath, internalizing as much as she could about the location of the next target. Clarisse drew on her relatively weak clairvoyance, showing Ryouko what she could about a possible safe location to reappear, where it seemed like there were no enemy personnel.

A moment later, they were there, and without moving away from her the others immediately carved holes into the walls and floor where Clarisse had indicated traps were present, blowing off chunks of debris, copious amounts of smoke, and---in Misa\'s case---electrical ozone. Ryouko stayed tense, ready to go back at the slightest hint of trouble. From all indications, it seemed that they had landed in a storage room, since the rear of the room was stocked with rounded cubes that looked like boxes. The walls were set in a rectangular shape, which was unusual for the aliens, who seemed to prefer rounded edges whenever possible. Other than that, the room had no other decoration, save for the round entry door, and lighting that seemed to come from the walls themselves.

A moment later they were done, and the room was clear.

Following an indicator on her internal interface, they headed out the proper exit in approved fashion, Nadya blasting through the door first with a telekinetic pulse designed to act as an impromptu barrier, the others behind her.

She hardly had time to process it, so quickly did it happen.

It wasn\'t the pain---that was instantly repressed---so much as the shock of it.

She felt herself going into fugue, and part of her registered that she was no longer directly attached to the lower part of her body. Somehow, she still functioned, well enough to realize what must have happened: stealth units that Clarisse had missed, waiting until they were slightly separated to attack. It was likely they had been stationed at all the remaining target points. Her combat interface was now missing, and she realized that *her* Clarisse might no longer be functional.

She considered trying to stay awake and fight anyway, doing her absolute best to keep her eye on the fight around her, rather than look down. She even raised her crossbow arm weakly, pointing it in the general direction of some of the attacking infantry, which Misa was gamely trying to keep visible by acting like a tesla coil, a swarm of constantly arcing electric bolts forcing the squid shielding to activate.

But then she saw Clarisse fall to the floor, eyes wide with the shock of "this isn\'t *possible*\", gem shattered with the rest of her hand, and Ryouko knew it was over. She launched every arrow she could, out of sheer spite, but doubted it would do much.

They had failed. Everything had depended on them, and they had failed.

Her eyes blurred, and she didn\'t know if it was the fugue, the tears, or something worse. What about her wish? It was still unfulfilled. If this was her end, then what had this even all been for?

She blinked, not bothering to check her gem. She wondered if she might now expect a pink Goddess to appear.

She thought of everything she had failed to do, the worlds she had failed to explore, the girl she had failed to contact. Why, at a time like this, did Asami seem so prominent in her mind?

She thought of what the girl might do now, and felt only regret.

*I\'m sorry,* she thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It had all been a simulation, of course, and Clarisse the TacComp had woken her early.

She had died in simulation before, of course, but this was the first time she had felt that kind of despair at the end, because it was the first she had died thinking it was real, with the stakes so high. It was also the first time Clarisse had terminated her involvement early because of the risk that the emotion would propagate to her soul gem. Indeed, sensing the risk, Clarisse had been slowly detaching her from the simulation, in the hope that it would sufficiently dull the emotions.

But it hadn\'t been enough, and she could still feel the echo of what had happened.

They took a breather, then tried again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"The locals really wanted to hit the hydroelectric plant,\" a slightly drunk Clarisse van Rossum said. \"It was obvious there was something big there. The security, the air raids, the failed commando raid---but it wasn\'t going to be easy. First, if we blew up the plant, the Germans would think it was a resistance operation, and they were in the nasty habit of killing everyone in the area when something like that happened. Second, a couple of the officers\' daughters were in the area, and they knew all about us---you couldn\'t possibly hunt demons in the area without running into them. We had to tolerate them, because if we didn\'t, they could bring the Germans down on the heads of the local families.\"

She shook her head at herself, trying to excavate the ancient memories.

\"They weren\'t bad girls,\" she said, \"but we hated them, and in the end, they hated us. We couldn\'t kill them, and they were too weak to kill us, so it was just like that. I didn\'t understand why my soul gem wanted me there, not until the commandos started landing.\"

\"We met immediately. Most of the others wanted to attack immediately, not give the Germans a chance to interfere, but I told them not to be stupid. All that would do is sound the alarm. We had to think of a way to distract them. I suggested dropping used grief cubes in the vicinity. Half of us would show up to hunt when they did, and buy as much time as possible bickering over possession of the cubes. The other half would quietly move to block them from getting back to the plant, in case they got back too soon.\"

Clarisse looked down, frowning at her empty glass cup. Reaching over, she poured herself more amber‐colored whiskey.

\"Well, that almost worked,\" she continued. \"Except they weren\'t quite as naïve as I expected, and left one girl behind, just in case we did something like that. I hadn\'t thought they would divide their team like that. I was part of the second team, and we did what we had to. We tried to capture her, since we didn\'t want anyone dead, but in the end---well, a broken soul gem looks like a natural death. Three girls dead at once, no matter how natural‐seeming, would have convinced the Germans of a conspiracy. One dead girl---even the most favored daughters probably couldn\'t talk their fathers into killing all the locals, just for *that,* even if they were Nazis. Especially when the daughters in question weren\'t really that cold‐blooded. Not as cold‐blooded as I was, anyway. I killed her myself, you know, when the others couldn\'t bring themselves to do it. Being more experienced has its benefits.\"

Without looking up, she put her cup to her lips, downing half of it in one go. With her last few statements, the mood had switched abruptly from vaguely celebratory to awkwardly quiet.

\"I stayed away from Warsaw, you know,\" she said, more to herself than to them. \"I had a good guess about what might happen there, and after Stalingrad, I wanted to go somewhere quieter. I fought my soul gem, forced my way to somewhere a little less important, and then found myself too weak to properly restrain a girl. It is as if fate...\"

Clarisse finally looked up at the rest of them, a few of whom had started to look a little queasy. Not Ryouko---she knew more about her hero than most people, and knew that her hands weren\'t exactly clean. However, this particular story was... different than what she remembered reading.

\"Don\'t think I\'m so drunk I\'ve started spilling secrets,\" Clarisse said, voice still startlingly crisp. \"I just don\'t like talking about it without some alcohol to dull the memory. It\'s not something I\'ve ever really told anyone about. I wanted to share a little, you know? You girls are still young---even you, Nadya. You have to understand what some of us have done to try to save this world. We all have our demons, and some of the failures I\'ve had---it still disturbs my sleep to think about. It wasn\'t my intention to end up on this mission, but now that I am here, I will do everything I can. I want you all to believe that.\"

There was a long awkward pause. Some of them nodded, slightly. Others stayed still, looking confused. Finally, Clarisse took a breath, getting back into the flow of the narrative.

\"The Germans just weren\'t big believers in sending their women and daughters anywhere near the front. How were they supposed to know that was a mistake? Many girls went on their own, but none of them could have known how important it was to get to Norway. Even I was there mostly by chance. I had a devil of a time convincing the locals I wasn\'t a German spy, by the way.\"

She pointed at Eva with the pinky of her left hand, which was also holding a cup of whiskey that tilted precariously, its contents threatening to overflow onto the floor, despite being only half‐empty.

\"I tell you, major wars like that are always a giant scramble for me,\" she said. \"I can never quite tell where to go. There are things happening *everywhere,* and trying to travel the world when half of it is trying to kill the other is no easy proposition. It\'s not really the soldiers or the border guards---it\'s the other magical girls. They don\'t trust you in the best of times. And there\'s always those who actually swallow the ideologies involved.\"

She shook her head, glanced at the cup in her hand, then swallowed the rest in one gulp.

\"I had to make a lot of tough decisions about where I wanted to go,\" she said, \"but the point is that even though Europe in 1939 turned out to be a good place to be, I missed a lot by doing it. And in 1945, it was a lucky decision on my part to travel to Japan through the United States. I couldn\'t understand how anything in the deserts of New Mexico could be important, but that was where Trinity was, of course. Sneaking into Japan was no small feat. I had to pretend to be German. At the time, there was no more disgusting thing you could have asked me to do, but I did it. It was worth it, if you can call witnessing Hiroshima worth it.\"

She set her glass back down on the table in front of her with a loud thunk, then smiled slightly, turning the charisma back on as if it were a switch.

\"I imagine we\'ve had enough of stories for now. Anyone know any good party games?\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"You know, standard protocol recommends taking a nap before a mission like this.\"

Ryouko looked up. She had been seated in bed, playing with CubeBot by tossing a grief cube and having the bot retrieve it. Probably not the safest thing to be doing, but safe enough: the cube was empty. She had left the door unlocked, of course.

\"You really wanted to talk about something, then?\" Ryouko asked, watching the girl in her doorway. She managed to maintain a steady composure, but it required that she hide a mix of apprehension and anticipation. She had almost managed to convince herself that she had imagined Clarisse\'s earlier comment.

Clarisse stepped into the room, the door sliding closed behind her. The girl closed her eyes briefly, rubbing her hands together, before opening them again.

\"I dislike dancing around the point,\" she said. \"The MHD psychiatrists are concerned about your mental state going into this mission. Usually, this kind of a thing would be for you and Atsuko‐san to discuss, but exceptions are made for time‐sensitive situations. To wit, she would much prefer that you leave on this mission with no regrets of the romantic variety. I\'m talking about Nakihara Asami‐san, of course.\"

Her Japanese was arguably flawless, showing none of the slight accent that characterized a speaker still partially reliant on implants. Still, the way she talked---it was almost as if she had stepped out of one of her own movies. It reminded her of... Mami?

Ryouko closed her eyes in turn, taking a deep, slightly exasperated breath.

\"Does everyone know about that?\" she asked, finally.

\"I think so,\" Clarisse said, without missing a beat. \"Probably, anyway. You\'ll find that very little escapes the attentions of our MSY overlords. It\'s why you can\'t sleep right now, right?\"

The girl sat down on the bed next to Ryouko, and looking into those light purple irises, she tried to decide whether she should try to fudge the truth.

\"Yes, it is,\" she said, finally.

\"Just to be clear, while it is occasionally useful to be perceived as having god‐like powers of perception,\" Clarisse said, \"I more or less stole that from your mind. You see this?\"

With a bright purple flash, a book appeared in her outstretched hand. The leather‐bound book appeared well‐worn and ancient, and on its cover cryptic runes proclaimed simply \"Clarisse van Rossum\".

Just as it occurred to Ryouko to wonder how she had managed to read the runes, the book vanished again.

\"I don\'t think you need an explanation about the book,\" Clarisse said, \"but several of the histories in here are of noted telepaths. The distance between here and the moon we are about to go to is many times larger than the distance between Mitakihara and Berlin, but it seems distance is very much a relative thing for my soul gem. Since I\'m now so close, the lock has come off of some of my powers. That includes mind‐reading, which I more or less abused just now.\"

Ryouko, of course, was the last person who needed an explanation of Clarisse\'s powers. The historian\'s powers got stronger as she approached an event of historical importance. Specifically, among other things, she could record the memories and powers of those she met within her book, as long as they consented---or were dead. In the ordinary course of things, it was merely a record. But at certain times, in certain places, it was something she could actually use. It was said that at such times she could be absolutely terrifying.

\"I know you\'re not the type to share readily,\" Clarisse said, still pinning her with those eyes of hers. \"So I\'ll tell you what I know. You\'re terrified of regretting your decision, which is why you haven\'t spoken to her, even though we are scheduled to leave in a mere few hours. But you know that not making the decision could be worse in any number of ways. It is immature to leave on your mission without speaking to her, or so you think, though I personally agree. I\'ve... felt what you felt, when you thought you were dead in those simulations. You regretted immensely not speaking to her.\"

Clarisse paused, and Ryouko simply waited, holding her breath. She was mesmerized, and though she realized that, she found herself unwilling to resist.

\"I won\'t presume to speak for you,\" Clarisse said, \"and it is terrible of me to violate you like this, but there is little time. You are different. I can tell, though I don\'t know how. Heterosexual, homosexual---you have rarely ever thought about such things, though surely Asami‐san has, by this point. I---\"

Clarisse blinked, once, and it was as if a spell had been broken. Ryouko released the breath she had been holding.

\"I\'ve only had a few relationships,\" Clarisse said, eyes suddenly downcast. \"And nothing that could have been deeply serious. The nature of my life has always prevented it. Am I missing something? I don\'t really know. Over the course of my life, I\'ve experienced a hundred, maybe even a thousand relationships, all second‐hand, all vicariously through the eyes of others. Even so, I don\'t really know. Atsuko‐san seemed to think that just because of all that I would know what to say to you. All I can say is that sometimes, love grows into you. It rarely happens as in the movies, with both parties in love at first sight. More often, there is one party that does the chasing, and perhaps the other party learns to like the chasing. If you are not sure, I would recommend giving it a try, at the very least.\"

Ryouko kneaded part of her quilt in her right hand.

\"Do you really think so?\" she asked. \"Part of what has me so frozen is that, in the end, I don\'t really know what orientation I am. I\'ve tried, I\'ve really tried, but I can\'t---the urge is not there. I can\'t help but think she might be very disappointed, to put it bluntly, assuming she\'s thought it through.\"

She felt her cheeks color slightly. It was not a topic she felt comfortable discussing.

\"You don\'t necessarily need an orientation,\" Clarisse said, looking up, but not trying to force eye contact. \"Don\'t feel bound by something like that. It seems to me that if it\'s so difficult to decide, it must not matter much. If you think you and her can coexist in the other relevant ways, then this will solve itself. That\'s... I suppose that\'s experience talking.\"

Ryouko stayed silent, playing with her hands.

\"You don\'t have to decide right away,\" Clarisse said. \"I know you fear the consequences of making a decision when you might die soon. But for your own sake, you should explain yourself to Nakihara‐san. You don\'t want to leave regrets behind. I\'ve experienced those memories. It\'s not pleasant.\"

Ryouko took a breath.

\"I think you\'re right,\" she said. \"Or rather, I know you\'re right. I\'ve just had trouble actually doing it.\"

Clarisse nodded.

\"I know,\" she said, \"but there\'s very little time left. I\'m just giving you one more kick. I\'ll stay here if you want, but---\"

\"No it\'s okay,\" Ryouko said, shaking her head. \"I\'ll call her. Do you mind---\"

\"I will go,\" Clarisse said, already getting up.

The door slid closed behind her.

Ryouko watched it for a moment, then took a breath.

*I\'m tempted to make some sort of joke right now,* the other Clarisse thought, *but I\'ll save it. You want me to place a call or what? Since she\'s on secondary training, it\'s actually pretty likely that she\'s busy. I thought about pointing that out, but I figure some sort of voice message would suffice. I didn\'t want to push you.*

Ryouko leaned down onto her bed.

\"I suppose,\" she conceded. \"I just feel like I\'m being so rushed by events. I---whatever, just do it.\"

She stared at the ceiling, waiting for the interstellar communication protocol to work its magic. In truth, she would have called even without Clarisse\'s visit, but... she had been procrastinating. She had realized that there was a good chance that by waiting so long, Asami would be unable to pick up, and she felt cowardly for secretly hoping that she could just leave a message. Clarisse had really given her a kick in the pants, she supposed.

It occurred to her that the connection was taking unusually long. That was unusual---if someone was busy, the response from the implants or TacComp was usually instantaneous. Instead, she was simply lying around waiting. It had been ten seconds, at least.

*IIC traffic volume in this area is extremely high,* Clarisse thought. For obvious reasons, including that everyone has military privileges. Still, that\'s not the reason for the delay. The connection has been active for a while now. I think we\'re waiting on her.*

Ryouko had figured that out for herself. She wondered why Clarisse would repeat the fact. It wasn\'t her style to supply her with redundant information.

\"Ryouko?\" Asami said, her voice cutting through the pattern of Ryouko\'s thoughts, tiny, slim face appearing in her vision, occupying a virtual screen that now covered the center of her vision.

Ryouko took a deep breath, realizing that the other girl, who also looked understandably nervous, could probably see her.

\"Hi, Asami,\" she said, feeling sheepish.

The other girl shifted her eyes to the side, looking off the edge of the virtual screen.

\"Meiqing said you\'d call,\" she said.

\"Yes,\" Ryouko agreed. \"I\'m surprised you\'re available, actually. I thought you might be busy with training.\"

Asami smiled slightly.

\"They cut it short, actually,\" she said. \"We\'ve been instructed to sleep, since the fleet moves to the front tomorrow. Something is obviously going to happen.\"

\"I see,\" Ryouko said.

The conversation was a bit strained, but it could hardly have been otherwise.

\"I may be dead tomorrow,\" she said.

The words were out before she could stop herself. Viewing the reaction on Asami\'s face, she rushed to correct the situation:

\"Sorry, I\'m sorry, I meant to say that I\'m going on a dangerous mission very soon. There\'s a high chance of not coming back. That\'s what I meant to say.\"

She listened to her own breath, angry at herself that she could botch it so badly.

\"Meiqing did mention a special combat mission,\" Asami said, voice slightly higher pitch than normal. \"She didn\'t mention something like that.\"

\"Look, Asami,\" Ryouko said, closing her eyes so she could just *say it.* \"I\'m not good at this kind of thing. I just want to say that you\'ve been a good friend and... I don\'t know. I just wanted to let you know that I appreciated you being here. This is not a rejection. I just... I don\'t know yet. I\'m not even sure I\'m lesbian. I wanted to wait, but I can\'t wait. I didn\'t want to just leave, in case I never spoke to you again. I--I don\'t know. Everyone says I should tell you how things are, so there it is. I guess.\"

Of course, closing her eyes had no direct bearing on whether she could see the transmission, but the system knew enough to black out the transmission when her eyes were closed, or at the very least Clarisse could do it.

She opened her eyes again, to find Asami smiling back strainedly, with perhaps a dash of pain.

\"I understand,\" the girl said, a moment later. \"I---It\'s not easy, I\'ll admit, but I don\'t want to be unfair. I don\'t want to pressure you. I---\"

Asami clenched her eyes shut, and Ryouko cringed internally at the sudden emotion.

\"It seems silly, to care so much about you,\" Asami said. \"But just come back alive, okay? Come back so I still have a chance to see you.\"

Embarrassed, Ryouko looked away, saying what she knew was the proper line:

\"Keep yourself alive too, okay? This is all moot otherwise.\"

\"I will,\" Asami said, nodding.

They stared at each other a moment.

\"How is it, being part of Magi Cæli, then?\" Ryouko asked, experimentally. \"I know you wanted a planetary posting, so...\"

Her voice trailed off, since she wasn\'t really sure where she was going with this. Fortunately, however, Asami seemed to perk up slightly, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand.

\"It\'s okay, I guess,\" she said. \"I can\'t really complain, since I didn\'t make a wish about that. My brother told me he\'s thankful. That has to be enough, I suppose.\"

She paused.

\"I\'d ask you where you are, but that\'s probably classified, right?\"

\"I\'m guessing so,\" Ryouko responded.

She wanted to say something else, but all she could think of were questions that were entirely inappropriate, or else monologues about varying topics: wormhole stabilizers, colonial organization, things like that. In the past, around a hundred virtual campfires, she had been able to keep Asami fascinated with things like that, but right now she couldn\'t help but feel it wasn\'t a good time. Not to mention that talking about wormhole stabilizers might be construed as hinting at classified information.

\"I guess that\'s goodbye for now, then,\" she said.

\"Yes,\" Asami agreed. \"Goodbye. For now.\"

The transmission ended, and Ryouko lay there for a little while longer, until Clarisse prodded her with:

*Well, since we\'re in the process of making difficult calls, I think now is a good time to call your parents.*

Ryouko sighed.

\"Yes, I suppose I should,\" she said out loud.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nakihara Asami let out a breath.

*To think just a while ago I lived at home, and all I wanted was to* get out. *How things change. I barely remember what any of them look like anymore.*

She frowned, tapping her fingers on the desk in front of her.

*She\'s going on some sort of mission tomorrow? And our training was abbreviated so the fleet can head out today? It can\'t be a coincidence.*

She considered a moment.

*TacComp, do you think there\'s any way for me to keep tabs on her combat status? You know, as some sort of alert‐style thing?*

*Probably not,* her robotic companion responded. *According to the records, she is serving as a lower‐tier staff officer on board the Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov, and has no upcoming combat missions. However, if what she told you is true, it is unlikely those records are accurate. Either way, there is no way for me to keep watch on classified information. In addition, I feel it is relevant to state that, as a matter of safety, magical girl personnel are usually quarantined from potentially distressing information about the activities of friends and lovers, pending MHD approval.*

\"Hmm,\" Asami said, out loud, reacting only slightly to the use of the word \"lover\".

*The Grapevine, if it exists, probably has only unreliable information*, her TacComp thought, intercepting her current train of thought. Consulting it in your state may result in negative consequences.*

She laughed silently.

*In my state...* she thought.

*You do know how to access it, though?* she queried.

*I had not anticipated this request, so it would take me some time to find out.*

\"Hmm,\" she said, again out loud. Maybe it was her imagination, but the device sounded almost reluctant.

The \"Grapevine\" was, of course, the covert information network that magical girls used to exchange information, outside the reach of Governance or, in many cases, even the MSY. It was difficult to deny information to a group of people that had universal telepathy and a subpopulation of mind‐readers.

So the rumors said, anyway. She hadn\'t ever had any contact with it, herself.

She looked at her hand, spreading her fingers out so that it framed the desk surface.

*Who would have thought I had it in me? But look at me now: I spend half my time moping about, and the other half dreaming about what I\'ll do when we finally get our own ship. I feel like some sort of stupid teenager... which I suppose I am. That seems so far away now, doesn\'t it? But it was such a nice idea...*

She sat there for a while, cradling her head in her arms on the desk, fantasizing about the future, about how they could explore undiscovered alien worlds together, how they\'d decorate the inside of their ship, and what they\'d do there...

\"Asami!\"

She startled awake, looking first at the girl who had woken her---Hosna Schaefer, one of her wingmates---then at her desk, where she was dismayed to see that a pool of drool had accrued.

\"Oh, so you *were* asleep,\" the girl said. \"Sorry, I was just stopping by to chat. But if you\'re sleeping...\"

\"No, no, it\'s okay,\" Asami said, rubbing her head and wondering, not for the first time, what good TacComps were if they wouldn\'t wake you in situations like this. Yeah, sure, it wasn\'t an *emergency,* but still...

The other girl sat on her bed, and watched her as she turned laboriously in her chair. She smiled slightly.

\"So how\'s the boyfriend?\" Hosna asked straightforwardly.

\"I don\'t *have* a boyfriend,\" Asami said automatically, the habit ingrained into her now.

\"Girlfriend, then.\"

\"I told you girls...\"

Asami let her voice trail off. Yes, maybe she had been a little too obvious about it the past few days, but for everyone to grill her on it like this---yes, she was quiet and easy to pick on, but was that really an excuse to---

\"What do you think about the Cult?\" she asked, diverting the topic to something else she had had in mind.

\"The Cult?\" Hosna repeated, tugging pointlessly on her own braid. "Nothing, really. Oh, no, you\'re not starting to buy into Jean\'s nonsense, are you?\"

\"It would be nice, wouldn\'t it, to be able to look forward to an afterlife like that?\" Asami asked, rhetorically. \"But I can\'t get myself to believe it. Probably for the better.\"

Hosna stared at her for a moment, then opened her mouth to say \"Okay, I guess I\'ll leave you alone then.\" before finally clamping her mouth shut and standing up abruptly, looming over Asami.

\"Nothing happened, right?\" she asked, with a hint of worry. \"You sure your gem is okay?\"

Asami blinked away her dreamy state, realizing she had accidentally given the wrong impression.

\"Oh, no, no, I\'m fine,\" she said. \"I was just thinking out loud.\"

To accentuate her point, she manifested her soul gem in the palm of her hand, showing that it still had a healthy dark purple glow... though perhaps tinged with a little black. She should remember to clean it soon.

The other girl looked at it skeptically.

\"You worry the rest of us, sometimes,\" she said, gently. \"I---take care of yourself, okay? I picked a bad time. I\'ll leave you alone. But, you know, we\'re here for you. I mean, maybe I can get Jean to talk to you, okay?\"

With that awkward pronouncement, the girl backed out of the room slowly, still watching her warily.

When the door shut, Asami slumped back onto her desk again, and sighed. Only a day at most until the fleet would go on serious combat duty, and here she was using her break time pining over a girl.

Well, maybe Meiqing would serve as a useful distraction. She should call.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Corridors full of killing and blood, but no screaming. The squid, as far as was known, didn\'t make any vocalizations worth mentioning. So, no screaming, except in the minds of the telepaths, who took it all stoically.*

*Events passed in a blur. Had it been possible to ask her, she would have been absolutely sure that something had happened---but completely unable to give any details. Indeed, it would have been valid to question whether they happened at all.*

*None of this led Ryouko to question the reality of what was around her. Such is the nature of dreams.*

*When it all faded away, she found herself looking up at an archaic stone edifice, similar---no,* identical*---to the back side of the Cult\'s headquarters.*

*Which meant, of course, that she was standing in the middle of a rose garden.*

*The sky was a blank white---not the white of clouds or the blinding white of a star, but merely white.*

*She looked down.*

*The garden was in full bloom, ponderous pink flowers weighing down on thorny branches. That\'s right: They were all pink, weren\'t they? Now that she had finally noticed, it astounded her that she hadn\'t noticed before.*

*Raising a hand to reach for a flower, she was startled to see that her hand and forearm were drenched in the copper‐green ichor of the squid. There was so much of it that it seemed to soak into her very skin, forming darker‐green channels wherever her skin folded on itself. It dripped from the ring of her soul gem, and from the sleeve of her costume, and it seemed to her that the color of the ichor and her gem were indistinguishable---though perhaps the ichor had managed to coat the ring itself.*

*Strangely, even to her, she was far from disgusted. Taking it all in stride, she reached her hand for the flower she was eyeing, a gorgeous specimen that was so heavy it seemed on the verge of breaking its own branch. Did roses grow like that?*

*Somehow, despite the deliberate care she took to avoid the thorns, she pricked herself anyway, jerking her hand away violently when the pain came. She crouched to look at the injured finger, where the iron‐red blood swirled briefly within the ichor, before the wound sealed itself shut.*

*A movement in the corner of her eye caught her attention, and looking up, she found that she had been looking at the edge of a white dress, the kind of sundress a woman might wear while tending her garden. Said woman was looking down on her with a warm expression, and was holding a rose in her hand, her flower picking exploits having evidently been more successful than Ryouko\'s.*

\"*Mama?*\" *Ryouko asked, confused that her mother would be here, of all places.*

*Instead of answering, the woman simply stretched her arms out, smiling.*

\"*Mama!*\" *Ryouko exclaimed, jumping up to embrace the woman, recovering for just a moment the simple emotions of childhood.*

*She buried her head in the woman\'s chest for a moment, and when she looked up again, she found the woman looking pensively at the rose in her hand.*

\"*It\'s probably an overplayed metaphor,*\" *she said,* \"*but the flower really does symbolize love quite well. It\'s a very fickle thing, but in the end I didn\'t regret it. I might have regretted some choices I made, but I never regretted having you.*\"

*Ryouko released the embrace, stepping back from the woman to look her in the face, uncertainty swirling in her mind.*

\"*Who... are you?*\" *she asked, a long moment later.*

*The woman tilted her head slightly, and smiled, as if humored by the question.*

\"*I am who you think I am,*\" *she said.*

*She bent over so that the two of them were the same height, and Ryouko found herself looking back into the woman\'s eyes. They looked normal, just like her mother\'s, just like her own, but she kept finding her gaze drawn back into the black pupils. There, she saw---*

\"*Do you know why they\'re attacking like this? Does anyone?*\"

*The voice was her own, but she wasn\'t saying it. It seemed to come from her own memory, but she didn\'t remember it.*

\"*No,*\" *a girl answered, a voice she recognized as Patricia von Rohr.* \"*No one has any idea. They just attack, and we defend. It is one of the mysteries of this war.*\"

*Then the voice of Kishida Maki:*

\"*No, I never regretted it. Despite everything, I never regretted it.*\"

*In those eyes, she saw---*

Her eyes snapped open, and she found herself looking once again at the contours of the real world.

*Clarisse!* she asked immediately, not even slightly dulled by post‐sleep languor. *Did you wake me?*

*I did not,* Clarisse responded. *I was trying to wait for that dream to end. But now that you\'re awake, you might as well stay awake. It\'s almost time for the mission to start.*

*Do you have any idea what it means?* Ryouko asked.

*I have absolutely no idea,* Clarisse thought, *and I find it distressing that we\'re both taking that question seriously. Not that I think it\'s wrong to do so, considering this is another memory my processing algorithms can\'t seem to touch.*

Ryouko frowned sharply.

*But I\'m nowhere near the Ribbon,* she commented.

*I know; I find it disturbing too.*

Ryouko thought about that a moment, seated in her bed, then got up decisively, stretching one arm out so CubeBot could climb up onto her shoulder, and using the other to reach for what few personal effects she had taken off the ship.

For better or worse, it was time to go. There was a chance she could direct her questions to the Goddess herself, soon enough.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko stared at the opposing wall of the room she was seated in, *HSS Raven*\'s spherical stealth generator chamber. She could have had it play some entertainment for her, but she wasn\'t quite in the mood for that.

They were in transit to the planet Orpheus, traveling at around lightspeed for stealth reasons, a journey that would take about a half‐hour, from their perspective. She supposed she should have been apprehensive, but instead found herself introspective, thinking back to the conversations she had had over the past day.

Closing her eyes, she visualized part of a conversation with her mother.

\"*I didn\'t raise you this old just for you to die on me!*\"

\"*I know, mama.*\"

\"*This quickly, and they\'re already sending you on \'special missions\'. I should have known. When I get my hands on---and that damned sister of mine---*\"

\"*Mama, grandpapa wanted me to give you his regards.*\"

*Her mother clenched her eyes shut, seeming to impose a measure of calm on herself.*

\"*I know,*\" *she said, after taking a deep breath.* \"*I\'ll tell you the same thing I told him. Just stay alive. That\'s all I want. This family and its insatiable---*\"

Ryouko opened her eyes, frowning. She had realized something.

\"*Don\'t die, okay?*\"

\"*Come back alive, okay?*\"

She had heard variations of that phrase over and over, almost since she had contracted, from sources as disparate as her psychiatrist, a distant ancestor, and a would‐be lover. It gave her the distinct impression that she\'d be letting a lot of people down if she died on this mission.

*You know, I\'ve been thinking,* Clarisse began.

Ryouko leaned backward, resting her head against the polished white surface that covered the interior of the ship, one of the pieces of modular furniture that were scattered ubiquitously around Raven, waiting to be summoned for usage.

*About what?* Ryouko asked, finally.

*If there really is a Goddess of magical girls,* Clarisse thought, *then it seems rather unfair that upon death, you get to go to some sort of afterlife, and I\'m going to end up rotting here.*

Ryouko thought about that. Over the past few weeks, she had grown increasingly convinced as to Clarisse\'s sentience. At the same time, she didn\'t feel as if she had truly internalized the fact. It was something she knew intellectually, then proceeded to ignore as she lived her life.

A rather disturbing image flitted across the surface of her mind: herself, soul gem shattered, with Clarisse still alive in the remains. Was that even possible?

She shuddered, slightly.

*Does it bother you?* she asked Clarisse. *There are religions that grant an immortal soul to AIs.*

*Yes, but this one seems to have actual* evidence *for it,* Clarisse thought, brushing past her point. *I don\'t mind dying. I just don\'t like how unfair it would be.*

*That\'s an... interesting way of looking at it. Of course, all this afterlife stuff is mostly speculation. From what I understand, it derives mostly from some statements Akemi Homura may have made once. I wouldn\'t think about it too hard.*

When Clarisse didn\'t respond, Ryouko blinked, looking around her to see if anything had changed. Nothing had. Mohammad Berriman was still seated in a chair in the middle of the chamber, seemingly staring intently at the roughly four‐meter cubical box in front of him which controlled the ship\'s stealth systems. At the moment, the side of the box was impassively gray, Mohammad choosing to use an internal interface rather than the external visual display, so it appeared as if he were staring at nothing at all.

Ryouko was far too used to that sort of behavior to find it strange.

Seeing her looking, Juliet François stepped away from Mohammad, who she had been impassively looming over. The girl walked over towards Ryouko, her thoughts radiating a sort of quiet confidence. Everything was fine, she was implying.

A set of furniture blocks moved themselves next to Ryouko\'s seat, shaping themselves into an extension that would turn her simple chair into something resembling a park bench.

Juliet sat down next to her on the newly assembled bench. Ryouko found them looking at each other, the other girl\'s hazel eyes level with her own green. Using her telepathy, the girl transmitted a brief wave of concern.

*I\'m fine,* Ryouko thought.

The other girl continued to stare at her.

*Really,* Ryouko insisted.

Juliet shrugged, and began stroking her braided ponytail, which she had thrown over one shoulder.

*I\'m sure someone has asked this before,* Ryouko thought, *and I\'m sorry if I\'m being rude, but is there a reason you don\'t ever speak?*

The other girl looked at her out of the corner of her eye, appraisingly. She seemed to be making some sort of decision.

Finally, Juliet thought:

*Gracia says you have internal turmoil. Not at peace. We\'ve asked; they say you\'ve had a vision, yet you have not joined us. Gracia says you think about the Goddess. And that your TacComp is different. Like a second mind. Very confusing.*

The words came out awkwardly, tersely, and a bit hesitantly, as if she were performing a task she hadn\'t done in a long while.

Ryouko\'s reaction to Juliet\'s words must have shown on her face, because Juliet added:

*Teams like this, the telepath often acts as MHD surveillance officer. She is concerned about you. And naturally, we are very curious about the Goddess. She also says... that the texture of your thoughts is strange. Secret for now, but we want to ask---*

Juliet paused for a moment, wearing one of her common impassive faces, one Ryouko had difficulty ever reading.

*---are you hiding something about this mission? A revelation? If it bothers you, perhaps we could help you understand it.*

Ryouko felt a moment, but only a moment, of quiet rage at the unwarranted intrusion into her thoughts.

Then she took a quiet breath, reminding herself that she had learned to expect as much, in close company with a telepath, and that over the course of their training, she had come to regard the telepath Gracia and the always‐quiet Juliet as friends. The two of them had reminded her of old‐style nuns during the quiet prayer ceremony they had held earlier, in a way Clarisse and Mina had failed to achieve.

*I don\'t know any more about this mission than you do,* Ryouko thought, finally. *I\'ve received visions, yes. But none of them tell me anything about what\'s going on here.*

*Visions?* Juliet repeated back to her. *You\'ve had more than one?*

Ryouko mentally reviewed the syntax of her last sentence. Yes, "visions\"---that was what she had said.

*Damn Standard and its declensions!* she thought, even though she knew very well that telepathy carried no ambiguity, regardless of what surface language was used.

*There were multiple parts to my vision,* Ryouko amended. *None of them were particularly enlightening.*

It was technically true, after all.

Juliet frowned, her emotions conveying a sense of thoughtfulness.

*Want to share? We could interpret together. We could get Van Rossum. She\'s an expert, perhaps glad to help.*

The girl seemed to hesitate more than usual on the last sentence, casting her eyes downward. Was she... embarrassed?

Ryouko frowned in turn, wondering if she should actually consider it, but then the bench she was sitting on began to grow longer still, pieces assembling to create yet more space on Ryouko\'s left.

She looked up just as Clarisse sat down, clearly intent on joining the silent conversation.

*In my experience, there is no consistent manner in which a vision should be interpreted,* the historian thought, without any prelude. Sometimes they are extremely symbolic, other times extremely literal. Sometimes the Goddess just tells you what she wants directly, without any rigmarole. And of course visions of the future don\'t always come true, or else there\'d be much less of a point in sending them. It should also be noted that not all visions are of the future. Some are of the present, some are of the past, and some show things that could never possibly have happened.*

Deciding not to comment on the fact that the telepathic conversation had been *private,* Ryouko turned to face Clarisse, trying to ignore Juliet, whose expression was suddenly so wide‐eyed her eyes seemed in danger of falling out.

*Do you think mine will come true, then?* Ryouko asked.

*It\'s difficult to say,* Clarisse said. *If preventing it were as simple as giving a warning, it is difficult to see why it was given so indirectly. It would have been far more trivial to give the warning to Kyouko‐chan herself, during one of her trips to the Ribbon.*

Clarisse paused to think, as Ryouko chewed on the casually dropped Kyouko‐chan,* complete with Japanese honorific.

*Of course, it\'s possible the Goddess was just trying to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak. After all, I doubt that was the only important thing about the vision.*

Clarisse gave her a knowing look, allowing Ryouko to wonder just how much the historian actually knew. It could have been an easy deduction on her part: Ryouko had pretty clearly been holding back during the Theological Council meeting. On the other hand, something about Clarisse\'s tone seemed to suggest it went deeper than that---was this more mind‐reading? Or had she simply \"overheard\" Ryouko\'s admission earlier that her vision had had multiple parts?

*I can\'t believe I let that slip!* Ryouko thought.

*You know, she could be reading your thoughts right now,* the TacComp Clarisse pointed out. *Heck, she could be reading* my *thoughts. There is precedent for telepaths pulling information out of Version One TacComps, much less Version Twos.*

Ryouko cringed internally, realizing that it was a good point.

*I don\'t think I like telepaths,* she thought. *And yes, I know she can probably hear that too.*

*As a community, telepaths don\'t really believe in privacy,* the historian Clarisse thought, turning her head away from Ryouko to face the opposing bulkhead. *It\'s part of the culture. But enough about that. As long as you believe none of your visions pertain to this mission, then you don\'t have to discuss it now, though I\'d love to hear about it later, if there\'s time. Actually, I\'m not just here to mind‐read and chat.*

With a violet shimmer, Clarisse\'s legendary \"Tome of Memories\" appeared in her hands, eliciting a gasp from Juliet and a jerk of surprise from Ryouko.

*This is always awkward,* Clarisse thought. *But since I have good reason to suspect I\'m the most likely to survive this mission, I\'ve been asking everyone involved in the mission if they want their memories stored with me. You know, just in case.*

Ryouko and Juliet stared at her, and then she continued:

*There\'s no pressure, just to be clear. I\'d be glad to perform the operation in case of... well, permanent death, but given the nature of the mission there might not be time. It\'s totally up to you, but if you have any secrets you might not want me to know, then... you probably shouldn\'t. And it\'s pretty intimate, psychologically speaking.*

For a moment, Ryouko thought she saw a predatory gleam in Clarisse\'s eyes, but before she could decide if it was real or not, it vanished.

*I\'m okay,* Ryouko thought. *Thanks for the offer, though.*

It occurred to her then to wonder whether memories of visions could be conveyed that way.

\"I\'d be glad to,\" Juliet said, and it took Ryouko a moment to realize that the girl had, improbably, said it out loud.

Clarisse nodded.

\"Very well,\" she said. \"Stand up.\"

As the girl scrambled to follow the command, Clarisse raised her hand, her soul gem ring glowing slightly.

Just as Ryouko realized what was happening, Clarisse transformed, a burst of brilliant violet light traveling outward from the ring and radiating through the rest of her body, replacing her clothing with the elaborate lacy formal dress and cap that constituted her magical girl costume.

\"I need a bit more power to perform the procedure,\" she explained.

She stretched forward with her hand, reaching for what appeared to be Juliet\'s chest, then seemed to think better of it, casting a glance in Ryouko\'s direction.

Clarisse\'s whispered something under her breath, and Ryouko noted something appearing on the girl\'s head---

With that, both Clarisse and Juliet vanished, leaving Ryouko blinking.

*Palladis auxiliis invoco,* her TacComp noted helpfully. *Strange that it\'d be in Latin, but I believe she summoned a form of invisibility.*

*Why, though?* Ryouko thought.

She didn\'t have long to wait for an answer; Clarisse reappeared a short while afterward with a startled looking Juliet, who was clutching her heart and breathing a little heavily.

\"I figured some privacy would be called for,\" Clarisse explained to Ryouko. \"You sure you\'re not up to it? It\'s quite painless.\"

\"I\'m pretty sure,\" Ryouko said---an understatement.

Ryouko looked up at the ceiling, checking the mission time. Soon they would enter their pre‐determined trajectory around Orpheus, engines silent for maximum stealth. They would wait until an exploitable opportunity in the alien defenses appeared or, if that failed to occur soon enough, make their move anyway.

Right now there was nothing to do but wait, and hope.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On board the *HSS Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov,* Mami let out a breath.

Within a simulation there was no reason to breathe, of course, but it still seemed like the natural thing to do. Unlike the practice runs she had participated in earlier, there would be no preliminary discussion with the other commanders, no conversations reviewing various aspects of the upcoming operation, no social banter. The commanders of the other fleets knew what they were supposed to do, and they knew when to do it.

Mami\'s fleet was the most conspicuous, sticking out like a sore thumb, assembling so much force in such a relatively small area of space that the squid couldn\'t help but notice---so much force that, indeed, they couldn\'t have concealed it even if they had been trying to.

The element of surprise was reserved for the other fleets, Gul\'s fleet divided between the system\'s asteroid belt and Oort cloud, and Anand\'s fleet gathering in the depths of space. True, it wasn\'t expected that their attacks would *succeed,* but that didn\'t mean they had to be stupid about it.

Because of that, there would be no direct communication, not until the attacks had developed and mutual radio silence was pointless.

Roland Erwynmark materialized at her side, as she stood brooding in her virtuality, the Kepler‒37 system hanging in space in front of her like so many toys in front of a child.

\"IntOps reports that Raven is approaching start position,\" Erwynmark said, peering at her from the corner of his eye. \"According to the schedule, it is time to start, Mami.\"

Mami closed her eyes for a moment.

\"I know,\" she said.

With a thought, the scale of the simulation changed, and she now stood among her own fleet, her virtual avatar hovering like a ghost within the core of her battle formation: Euphratic Sector Fleets I through VII, arrayed in the rarely‐used Drill formation, a sharp V‐shaped cone that was field manual approved for offensive fleet operations, as opposed to the more common C‐shaped Shield formation that was seen in defensive operations.

Both sides were heavily reliant on their capital ships, but the human fleet was vulnerable to flanking by the faster alien bomber fleets, so they had to rely on formation to protect their battlecruisers, rather than simply fly interceptors around wherever necessary, as the aliens did. On the offense, however, the battlecruisers had to be able to close in on their targets, so the Drill placed the battlecruisers near the tip, with a very heavy concentration of cruisers, frigates, and so forth in front, forming the point of the spear. By bending the frontal plane back into a cone, the battlecruisers were given a maximum range of possible targets to choose from; a battlecruiser\'s most powerful weapon, the SHERMAN cannon, was spinally‐mounted, and could only fire forward. On the other hand, the V made it more difficult for segments of the plane to support each other. Mami\'s own First Fleet had place of honor at the spearpoint, and the other fleets were arrayed at various locations along the cone, but for the battlecruisers this was a complete abstraction, since they had been mostly detached and shifted into the tip.

Mami took another breath. Erwynmark was right: it was time.

She broadened the horizons of her mind, using her Field Marshal\'s cortical implants to stretch her perceptions wide, drawing into herself the processing of Machina, the thrumming power of *HSS Zhukov,* the rhythms of her fleet. She allowed herself to listen in, for just a moment:

*Squadron E‒6*---Avenging Angels---*in standby positions, members report nominal---*

*Reactor power at 400% baseline, indicators green---*

\"*What are they doing up there? Why aren\'t we moving? My thrusters itch!*\"

\"*Your thrusters do not \'itch.\' Calm down. I, for one, am not in such a hurry to die. I have family, you know.*\"

\"*You have backups! Any more talk like that, and they\'ll retire you.*\"

\"*As if---*\"

\"*I hope Mami knows what she\'s doing.*\"

\"*I hope* any *of us know what we\'re doing.*\"

\"*Fair enough---*\"

In the distance, she sensed Erwynmark and the other admirals of the seven fleets doing the same as her, settling into command on board their respective ships, taking control of various aspects of fleet operation. No sense in having other flag officers in the area, even on observation, if they weren\'t going to be used.

Her awareness of the world expanded, the implants gently releasing the strictures of her merely human perception---those strictures that, for better or worse, applied to magical girls as well. Instead of seeing only what was in front of her, her field of view widened, reaching around her, so that she could \"see\" in every direction. She grew gradually aware of events far distant from her, of Apollo and Artemis\'s orbital defenses and remaining ships huddling into desperate defensive positions, of tens of millions of ground troops and colonial militia fortifying, bracing themselves for what was to come. Only the other fleets---Gul\'s and Anand\'s task forces---stayed out of her awareness, the need for radio silence inhibiting communication.

With the sensors of seven fleets, she saw the electromagnetic emissions of the world around her---radio, infrared, ultraviolet, X‐ray, gamma---the colors of the spectrum, augmented by the subtleties of wave polarization and single‐photon effects, revealing unimaginable forms of sensory perception. The throbbing of the fleet\'s FTL drives, the flexing of space‐time around them, the Field Theory that underpinned it all---she understood it not with a painfully‐learned physicists\' grasp of the world, but at a deep instinctual level, as the ships of her fleet did.

In the depths of her mind, she felt something fundamental shifting, pieces of her personality rearranging around something new. Slowly, she began to regard the constituents of the fleet not merely as tools at her disposal, but as limbs of her body. Erwynmark thought, and commanded---Zhukov thought, and commanded---Machina thought, and commanded---and it became difficult to separate their actions from her own.

Mami knew many officers who were almost addicted to Maximal Command Mode, the mode only used by senior officers of a fleet in combat, that a simulation only approximated. Many waxed almost rapturous about this kind of expanded perception, this sense of being part of a greater whole---but, personally, she could hardly think about it without shuddering. She hardly felt human anymore.

But that was a secondary consideration, the idle wanderings of only a small part of her consciousness. There were more important things to attend to.

Across the fleet, a sense of expectation emerged, as AIs ran final checks, officers braced themselves in their command chairs, and chatter died down. Even without a formal command, the mood of the higher officers easily percolated downward, all the way down to the fighter pilots being told to pull closer to the larger ships.

Finally, the formal countdown started, ships accelerating, matching velocities, warming up their FTL engines. Throughout the fleet, human officers, gunners, and pilots activated their combat modes, accelerating the pace of their thoughts, so that the tick of the passing seconds seemed to stretch into eternity.

〈**BEGIN**〉

Rather than springing from any one source, this single monumental command seemed to come from the fleet itself, millions of individual chronometers reaching the designated moment.

With no need for stealth, the fleet could move as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, not only were they constrained by the need to reach the alien defenses at a combat speed below the speed of light, their ability to accelerate and decelerate, especially for the larger battlecruisers, was rather constrained. As such, the trip was a nervewracking ten‐minute affair, spent within the enormous collective fleet FTL shell. The impracticality of FTL combat made it unlikely they would be intercepted halfway en route, before they reached the fixed defenses and FTL interdiction that would make it impossible to continue, but it couldn\'t be entirely ruled out.

The planet Orpheus began to loom larger and larger within her field of vision. The fleet was already decelerating. Soon they would reach optimal exit distance, the FTL shell would dissolve, and the aliens would be waiting.

But first---

As they approached the exit point, speeds dropping, a massive wave of alien \"Raptor\" missiles entered the shell, ramming straight into their approach. Carrying cheap FTL drives, the missiles were capable of independent FTL travel and, more importantly in this context, capable of entering other FTL shells without being shoved aside. With a relative speed greater than the speed of light, the length‐contracted missiles would pass straight through the fleet in a matter of seconds, but that wasn\'t the point. The point was what they intended to run into on the way. Firing a single Raptor at a single FTL ship was tantamount to wasting a missile on a practically guaranteed miss---firing a wall of Raptors into a fleet was another thing entirely, given that the core of said fleet had a ship density of greater than one ship every ten square kilometers. Further, the explosive charge of the average Raptor, already quite potent, would now be nearly meaningless in comparison to the sheer kinetic energy its mass would carry in their reference frame.

Of course, this was standard tactics for the aliens, whose Raptor missiles served as a constant reminder of the relative infancy of human FTL technology, which could in no way afford the expense of placing an FTL drive on a self‐destructing missile.

Knowing from painful experience that the Raptors would be coming, the fleet had already deployed countermeasures, in the form of its own preceding wave of counter‐missiles, and a phalanx of mines, drones, and other point defenses.

There was a moment of blinding crossfire, as the missiles from both sides slammed together in a devastating relativistic firestorm, fast even by the standards of Mami\'s accelerated thoughts. Cataclysmic amounts of energy poured outward, filling the EM spectrum with activity.

*Minor damage to ship sector 10‒K,* Zhukov thought. *Damage control en route.*

Mami did not feel pain---that would have been counterproductive. Still, the ship and personnel losses ate at her viscerally, and she felt her awareness shrink, just a little.

*Forty‐four thousand,* the human part of her thought. *My God, and we\'re just getting started.*

Seconds later, the FTL shell dissolved, and the battle began in earnest, the formation of the fleet smashing into the wall of missiles, lasers, and projectiles emanating from the alien defenders, their own weapons answering, so that the plane of impact became a wall of fire and roiling chaos.

Hundreds of thousands of frigates and millions of droneships twisted and weaved their way through the chaos, seeking to evade, deflect, or destroy the incoming rain of death. The cruisers and light carriers unloaded their defensive magazines, their *MC* complements helping them to stand like rocks against the stormy sea.

The overall speed of the formation slowed to a crawl, so that there was no longer any need to consider relativistic effects when examining the front as a whole, but for the smallest ships, many of which were traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light relative to the larger ships, it was a matter of life and death. Traveling fast made you hard to hit, but it also made your own targeting difficult---and you did *not* want to run into anything, including the ubiquitous enemy self‐sacrifice drones. At relativistic speeds, the only remotely realistic targets were the ships of cruiser size and up---everything else, you had to match speeds with if you wanted to do anything to them, which of course made you *their* target as well. To counter interceptors, the larger ships deployed prodigious amounts of firepower, coupled with almost literal walls of flak and drones.

The Magi Cæli operated by slightly different rules, of course.

In the opening stages of a battle, battlecruisers were usually at far too great a distance from the enemy\'s capital ships and fixed defenses to inflict direct damage on critical targets. Every battlecruiser longed, deep down its AI heart, for the satisfaction of shattering enemy capital ships with brutal frontal firepower---but in practice, they spent most of their time as they would now, shaping the battlefield with their FTL interdiction, directing the flow of battle with their onboard fire control, and serving as a threatening source of firepower that must be either avoided or neutralized. From within them, the field marshals, admirals, and commodores of the seven fleets, as well as the AIs of the ships themselves, choreographed the battlefield---shifting reserve forces, reinforcing battered parts of the line, withdrawing badly damaged ships, adjusting frigate attack formations, and otherwise performing the myriad functions of command, often in direct mental consultation with the ships and captains involved.

The fleet\'s battlecruisers fired, SHERMAN projectiles barreling through temporary gaps that opened and closed in the human lines, precisely for that purpose. Properly configured, their exotic matter cores ravaged and tore at the fabric of local space‐time, disabling FTL drive usage in the area for as much as twenty minutes at a time, an eternity in a battle such as this. Fifteen battlecruisers in one fleet formation easily ranked among the densest concentrations of human capital ships ever deployed, and the battery of their fire changed the complexion of the battle. Some projectiles attacked the flanks of the alien deployment, seeking to delay and disrupt the inevitable flanking counterattacks. Others tore into the heart of the alien fleet, disrupting entire incoming waves of squid bombers and Raptor missiles, some arriving from as far away as the moons of Orpheus themselves, from the heavy missile batteries that had spent the past weeks sprouting like mushrooms within the alien fixed defenses. Mami knew that if she could be there to see the detonations in person, she would see a night sky torn into a nightmare of impossible distortions, shattered and filled with hard radiation of every kind, streaked by a thousand ships distorted by the effects of their own speed.

The alien battlecruisers in the area responded, their gamma ray Eviscerator laser cannons carving angry swaths through the human fleet. Battlecruisers were not the centerpiece of the alien fleet, instead acting primarily as planetary bombardment and defense of last resort, but they were appreciably more powerful than the human equivalent---fortunately, there were only three of them.

She oversaw it all, shadowing the staccato, fever‐pitched tenor of internal communications like a ghost. They were still far from the wormhole stabilizer, and the aliens kept the majority of their forces near the moon itself. Cannily, the aliens hadn\'t fallen for the trap of moving their forces preemptively outward, to counter the obvious human attack under preparation. However, since they hadn\'t, their outer defenses were vulnerable and at a clear numerical disadvantage. Mami needed to punish them for that, by inflicting as much damage as she could during the brief period it would take for the alien inner defenses to reorganize and move out. Now that they had been able to directly confirm the scale of the alien outer defense, the battle simulations being run by the battlecruisers were very positive---the aliens were seriously outnumbered and outgunned, and pinned against something they had* to defend. Without reinforcements, it seemed like they could be ground to dust.

But of course reinforcements would come. They had to. Mami was counting on it, after all.

As the first alien bomber waves crashed into the fleet\'s outer defenses, Mami allowed herself a moment to focus on the battlecruisers...

...1219‒4.193‒0.74. Firing. 1184‒4.02‒0.80. Firing. Target of opportunity: 1379‒3.91‒0.81, Cruiser, Designation Number: 2931. Firing. Disabled. 1201‒3.87‒0.79. Firing...

...Sector Epsilon‐Nu‒13 taking unexpected losses, *HSS Manfred von Richthofen,* scramble reserve interceptor squadrons 17, 18, 19, 20, *MC squadron 7, 8 to sector...

...*HSS Ludwig van Beethoven* confirmed lost. *HSS Qiu Ying* shift position. *HSS Eugène Delacroix* attempting withdrawal. *HSS Haile Selassie* reporting energy reserves down to 6.7%/critical...

...*HSS Robert Hackworth* reports: *MC* losses, 15%; *MC* recovered, ; Interceptor losses, 43%...

Even abstracting intership communication to natural language introduced inevitable losses of meaning, and it was impossible for her, even in her expanded state, to possibly digest all of it. While battlecruisers out of combat were perfectly happy to socialize with each other using their human personalities, in‐combat communication involved the mutual transmission of unfathomable amounts of data, the even more unfathomable real‐time processing of said data, and a level of mental combat coordination that simply was not meant for human minds to handle. It was only in the regions of her mind directly connected to Zhukov, the regions where the distinction between her and him grew indistinct, that she could handle all that was going on, that she could make decisions with a true understanding of the situation, and while the tradition of the human military was to credit battlefield decisions to the human generals, it could not be honestly said that decisions were made by either her or Zhukov, but only perhaps by an amalgamation of both.

*Blink cannon discharge, partially mitigated,* Zhukov thought. Forcefield absorption: 35%. Forcefield energy reserves: −9.3% to 90. of combat capacity; status: stable. Sector 26‒G: lost. 26‒H: major damage. 25‒G: major damage. 26‒F: minor damage. 27‐G: minor damage. Power generation reduced by 5% to 95% of combat level. Estimated personnel losses: 550±15.*

*Blink cannon discharge, partially mitigated,* Zhukov began again. Forcefield---*

Were Mami still wearing a human avatar, she would have grimaced. All across the human fleet, in otherwise well‐protected locations, alien nuclear and antimatter devices were appearing out of thin air---or rather, hard vacuum---and detonating, taking a grim toll on critical light carriers, battlecruiser systems, *MC* deployments, and other convenient targets. The most valuable of all alien capital ships, the blink cannons, were making their appearance, as expected. It just showed that they weren\'t going to be fooling around---but of course, that was obvious, and entirely expected.

**Current estimated fleetwide casualties:** 160,000.

**Current loss rate:** 550 sentients per second.

A small part of Mami\'s consciousness---5%, she could report, with Yuma‐like precision---cringed at that. It was easier if she thought of those not as people, but as a statistic. After all, the battle had barely begun, and for a fleet of this size, those casualties were hardly meaningful. Downright unthreatening, actually, considering that the alien bomber fleets and flank attacks had thus far failed to make significant progress, running aground on a veritable wall of firepower from her fleet\'s frigate line, dying by the tens of thousands inside specially planned *MC* kill lanes. None of the tactics were novel, or unusually effective---the alien outer defenses were simply too weak, and as a consequence, they were failing to inflict enough damage on her fleet, unable to stop the forward momentum of her battle line.

She pressed onward, driving the wedge of her fleet deeper into the alien defenses. Yes, it was necessary that she keep casualties down, because it wasn\'t expected that this attack would succeed---but if she wanted the aliens to pull their reserves away from the wormhole stabilizer, she had to at least make a good show of it. And that meant threatening to do some major damage.

Communications had been opened again with the other two task forces. Things were going about as expected, perhaps even better than expected. Alien forces had already appeared to challenge Admiral Gul, whose asteroids were making good progress through the system. Fleet Admiral Anand had even managed to achieve tactical surprise, and had had a good run of blowing up transports before the arrival of alien reinforcements. Still, the reinforcements had arrived rather quickly; here, the alien strategy---keeping their reserve intact and ready, instead of responding preemptively to gaudy threats of force from Mami\'s fleet---paid off, allowing them to much more easily limit the amount of damage Anand could inflict.

Even so, long‐distance scanners were showing that alien fleet density near Orpheus proper was starting to thin, as the aliens began mobilizing units to counter the various threats---the trend, at least, was good.

Mami allowed her personality to dissolve even further, settling deeper into the battle. Right now wasn\'t the time for high‐level rumination---not yet, anyway. Right now was simply the doing.

The alien bomber waves were not penetrating deep enough to be threatening, and multiple attacks on their flanks had petered out without even breaking the frigate line, much less the cruiser line. The alien\'s outer fleet defenses simply hadn\'t brought enough to the party to stop them. Not with a full fifteen battlecruisers in play. The battlecruisers were now much deeper in the alien fleet and had mostly run out of interdiction targets, alien bomber power being too weak to be worth devoting much attention to. Consequently, they were now free to fusillade the alien ships directly. Even with their advanced forcefield technology, alien frigates were not a match for battlecruiser firepower, and the cruisers, coming under direct pressure from human droneships, missile waves, and *MC* infiltration squads, were not faring much better.

The casualty numbers in Mami\'s consciousness continued to climb, doubling, tripling, quadrupling, but not disproportionately. Even as a statistic, a million in casualties was hard to stomach, but it was entirely appropriate for a battle of this scale.

Instead, she was now watching other numbers: ship count, estimated alien ship count, abstracted fleet strength. The last set of numbers had at the beginning of the battle indicated that the aliens had a slight chance of prevailing without reinforcements, but that possibility was now clearly extinguished, as alien strength began to plummet appreciably. More importantly, the relative balance of power was clearly favoring them more and more, and the combat simulations were indicating that if the aliens wanted to preserve their outer fixed defenses on this side of the planet, reinforcements were clearly called for. Human bombers---a rare experimental novelty, still quite flimsy compared to the alien equivalent---were even starting to conduct bombing runs on the orbital defense of the nearest of Orpheus\'s moons, hoping to take out some of the Raptor missile batteries.

*Come on, you bastards,* Erwynmark thought, on board the Arminius, the thought percolating over to her. *Come on. What are you waiting for? This is the moment. You either reinforce, or you withdraw. You cannot hold here.*

Even the alien battlecruisers were coming under fire now, moving forward to buy time for the more important capital ships. Their forcefields were stupendously powerful, and their Eviscerator lasers were very painful. They would only fall under the weight of extremely heavy firepower, and the effort of all branches of the fleet.

Neither Mami nor Erwynmark bothered giving the order explicitly, though their thoughts may have conveyed the idea implicitly. Either way, the battlecruisers of Fleets I through VII, some of them eighteen‐year veterans, the oldest in the fleet, knew what to do, moving in for the kill.

*Long‐distance sensors are reporting that significant portions of the alien fleet defenses near the wormhole stabilizer are moving out, prepping for FTL transit,* Erwynmark commented, even though they both already knew, and there was no need for a human mode of communication.

*Yes,* Mami thought.

*It\'s working,* Erwynmark thought.

*Yes,* Mami thought again, and though she was reticent, she felt a glimmer of long‐suppressed hope starting to rise. The situation resembled their successful simulations far more than their failures.

*We\'re not there yet, though,* she thought.

*Yes,* Erwynmark thought. *Before they get here, let\'s do what we can.*

The battlecruisers of the fleet moved into range of one of the alien battlecruisers simultaneously, careful not to present an obvious target. The longer‐range Eviscerator cannons opened fired immediately, spearing one of the battlecruisers---Erwynmark\'s. Mami glanced at the damage:

*Eviscerator impact, minimally mitigated,* Arminius thought. *Forcefield absorption: 10%. Forcefield energy reserves: −40% to 50% of combat capacity; status: recovering. Sectors 15‒18 lost. SHERMAN cannon firing energy reduced by 10% to 90% of combat level. Power generation reduced by 5%. Estimated personnel losses: 3000±50.*

*Damn it,* Erwynmark thought.

Following standard procedure, the Arminius began to withdraw, not because it was critically wounded, but to force the alien ship to choose other targets, to distribute the damage. It didn\'t really take fifteen battlecruisers to take down an alien ship, once they got within range.

When they finally got within range of *their* cannons, the battlecruisers opened fire. There was a brief minute of furious firing, the enormous kinetic energy of the SHERMAN projectiles combining with their disintegrating exotic matter to tear at the astoundingly powerful alien forcefield, which held, and held, and held, until it finally could hold no more, buckling under the force, giving them all the satisfaction of seeing an alien capital ship break up under their cannons.

The aliens had extracted their price, though---half the human battlecruisers had wounds to lick, and the fleet had lost a displeasing amount of smaller ships. Though the damage was relatively minor, there would undoubtedly be more of it as they hunted down and destroyed the two remaining alien battlecruisers.

That unpleasant thought, though, was banished by:

*Heavy carrier, Designation Number: 2, confirmed severely damaged. Unlikely to survive further combat.*

Some of their stealth frigates had gotten through, and their *MC* teams had done their jobs, the news having only trickled back slowly; the knowledge had to be acquired by sensor scan, since the teams themselves would be seeking new targets, and would not return until the battle was nearly over. Now the heavy carrier, one of the most valuable of the alien capital ships, was dead in space, having apparently undergone catastrophic exotic matter containment failure. With elements of the human fleet closing in, it was already being abandoned.

Though it wasn\'t quite appropriate yet, Mami allowed herself a moment of triumph, as the fleet reorganized itself into a defense posture to meet the expected alien reinforcements which, according to estimates, were more than powerful enough to force them back, consisting of no less than ten heavy carriers, seven blink cannons, seven battlecruisers, and accompanying escorts.

But that, of course, was expected. They just had to hold out until the stabilizer was---hopefully!---destroyed, and it would all work out.

Mami surveyed the situation, feeling a tiny bit of satisfaction. Even in their defensive posture, elements of the fleet were still pursuing the retreating fleet they had just defeated, and other elements---the relatively untouched Fleets III and V, which had been holding the far flanks---had left formation---doing their best to smash the defenses on one of Orpheus\'s moons. In the bigger picture, not that significant, but it sure *felt* good.

*No,* Erwynmark thought, and it was the sudden darkness of his tone, strange to say, that first tipped Mami off that something was wrong.

Then the information entered her mind too.

Long‐range sensors reported sudden gravimetric anomalies emanating from the alien wormhole stabilizer. While small in magnitude, they were rapidly growing larger, and while superficially resembling the test runs they had seen earlier, were substantially more complex, peaking at much higher distortion levels and attaining much higher oscillation frequencies.

*No,* she echoed, because honestly she didn\'t know what other response was appropriate. *It can\'t be! They can\'t be* that *ahead in construction! It must be another test!*

Their attention now focused heavily on the long‐range sensor reports. The anomalies showed no signs of shrinking or even plateauing, only growing stronger and stronger. The kinds of readings that had never been recorded near any natural object, unless one counted unreliable astronomical observations of black holes. In fact, the last time anything similar had been recorded was near the functioning wormhole stabilizer in the Saharan Sector, destroyed by Erwynmark all those years ago.

The conclusion was obvious---obvious enough that most of their focus immediately switched back to the fleet, to their communication channels with Gul and Anand, to hold an emergency meeting. They had planned for this contingency, but it had been considered unlikely enough that they planned... well, only a little.

Only a small part of Mami\'s consciousness---6%, to be exact---continued to watch the progress of the stabilizer in horror. The crust of the moon under the wormhole stabilizer shifted slightly, but it was doubtful the aliens cared. The anomalies---the *oscillations*---became more focused, sharper. In fact, if one drew a diagram of what they looked like, it could be seen that the gravitationally distorted area seemed to be emanating from the almost fully‐constructed ring atop the wormhole stabilizer, forming a cone shape that stretched upwards, seeming to terminate in orbital space. There, at the tip, a single anomaly of unprecedented strength was forming, growing stronger, exceeding anything that had ever been seen.

And, finally, the tear, as---it was guessed, they weren\'t really sure---space‐time itself sheared under the strain, and the single anomaly grew in a single burst, reaching the size of a full shipyard. It stabilized, and calmed, appearing now exactly as the wormhole had at the Saharan stabilizer.

Through the wormhole, she could see stars on the other side.

The first alien reinforcements, the *real* reinforcements, began arriving only seconds later.

Then, the news arrived that major alien fleets had been spotted approaching the planets of Apollo and Artemis. This news, which before would have been proof that the aliens had fallen completely for the human plan, arrived with all the bitter aftertaste of biting into what should have been a sweet apple, and instead finding a rotten core.

The aliens had waited for them to commit their fleets, then sprung their* trap.

> In the decades since the original Cephalopod incursions, much has been learned about the aliens\' physiology, nearly all of it from the dissection of alien corpses, due to the stubborn alien refusal to submit to live capture, as well as the seeming impenetrability of the encryption protecting alien data cores.

> Despite the common nickname \"squid\", the Cephalopods are in fact far more similar to octopuses than to squid, resembling squid only in elements of the layout of their grasping forelimbs. While any analogy between terrestrial animals and sentient aliens is bound to be flawed, the aliens share substantial superficial and deep similarities with octopuses. In terms of appearance, alien skin has a similar, rubbery texture, the eyes and the head strongly resemble the common octopus, and the prehensile forelimb tentacles behave much like their terrestrial counterpart. This resemblance is further reinforced by a set of tentacles that ring the mouth, believed to be useful for feeding.
>
> Perhaps the most striking similarity between alien and octopus is in the nervous system, which anatomical studies have found to be substantially decentralized compared to terrestrial vertebrates, leading, among other things, to the common military knowledge that a Cephalopod\'s body will often continue resisting even after disconnection from its head. (Indeed, it is speculated that the decentralized processing nodes, a notable feature of alien implanted enhancements 〈upon which elements of the design of the Version Two TacComps were based〉②, are 〈themselves〉② based upon alien studies of their own physiology.)
>
> The similarities between the Cephalopods and octopuses end abruptly, however. While anatomical evidence strongly suggests that the Cephalopods evolved from an ocean‐dwelling organism, their physiology carries numerous adaptations necessary for survival on land. Microscopic scales covering the skin prevent desiccation, the eye membranes do not resemble those of octopuses, a set of ear holes has appeared on the head and, of course, any gills that may have existed have been replaced by a set of lungs, whose design resembles that of terrestrial birds. Further, while the four alien forelimbs may be reasonably described as tentacles, they are more rigid and less flexible compared to the octopoid counterpart, and the two hindlimbs, which the Cephalopods rely on for locomotion, are heavily modified for weight‐bearing, and are no longer prehensile. Perhaps most dramatically, Cephalopods contain a rudimentary internal skeleton, which is believed to be an evolutionary novelism specifically intended to support large bodies outside the water.
>
> In addition to the adaptations for land, the Cephalopod body design carries a number of adaptations almost certainly associated with the emergence of sentience, including a series of calcium shells protecting important nerve clusters and a set of fine, secondary tentacles protruding from the distal ends of the forelimbs, serving a role analogous to the Human hand. In addition, Cephalopod eyes display a substantial amount of white sclera, likely serving a role identical to the similar adaptation found in Humans: enabling other members of the species to readily identify where an individual is looking, useful for social communication. This eye design, strikingly Human for an octopoid alien, is often considered disturbing by Human soldiers.

> No description of the Cephalopods would be complete without a description of the extensive network of cybernetic and mechanical implants found in alien corpses. Many are believed to be exactly analogous to ones customarily installed in civilian Humans, providing communication, life‐support, anti‐aging, and augmentation functions, while others provide more unusual fuctions, such as a self‐destruct capability that has yet to be successfully circumvented〈without the constant application of mind‐control magic〉③. These implants are evidently more advanced than the Human equivalents, often making use of biological motifs not previously experimented with in Human designs.

Indeed, given the substantial power advantages of using biological components for computing, it is unclear why alien usage of this technique is as limited as it is...

> Ever since Field Marshal Erwynmark\'s Saharan Raid encountered and destroyed the first of the alien Wormhole Stabilizers, much ink has been spilled speculating on the purpose and functioning of these enigmatic devices---and speculation is what it really is, since the stark lack of information about alien society and economic structures precludes any truly accurate analysis of the situation. While the subsequent development of more precise gravimetric sensors has allowed the detection of a number of similar structures throughout the alien sectors bordering Human space, a number of fundamental questions remain unaddressed, and controversial. It is unknown, for instance, where these wormholes lead, whether their purpose is primarily military or civilian, and whether their presence is confined only to border regions.
>
> Common sense, and hypothetical simulations of space‐faring civilizations, suggests the likely answer: that the wormholes are used as a transport network connecting distant alien worlds, including the still unidentified alien core worlds, and that their purpose must be both military and economic. However, this kind of straightforward reasoning also leads to a number of conclusions about the current war that have since proven entirely untrue, leaving many scholars reluctant to adopt a common consensus---some have suggested, for instance, that the alien wormholes lead not to some local sector of the galaxy, but to distant sectors, distant galaxies, or even the far side of the observable universe.
>
> Even more perplexing than the question of purpose is the question of function. In many ways, the wormhole stabilizer found by Erwynmark fulfilled the predictions of early modern physics, which suggested the possibility of wormholes stabilized by some at the time undiscovered exotic matter. Indeed, similar designs were considered by Project Janus, as a means of interstellar travel, but advancements in Field Theory suggested that such wormholes were, in fact, impossible, leaving the topic of wormhole construction to gather dust until the Saharan campaign. Yet despite the efforts of theoretical physicists, little progress has been made in divining a mechanism for alien wormhole function, leading a few ambitious physicists to lobby the military to make a greater effort to attack another one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Goddess,\" Gracia said, looking at the viewscreen.

The group of them, all nine magical girls plus a few members of the crew, had gathered in Raven\'s frontal pilot\'s area, after an urgent summons from the captain. Of course, they could have watched on their internal displays, but some things were just better seen collectively. Even Raven\'s avatar had appeared for the event.

For a while, no one spoke, demonstrating just how well Gracia\'s sentiment had illustrated their reactions. They watched on passive sensors as the alien wormhole executed its opening sequence, the false‐color gravitational sensors showing a region of space folding itself into an arrangement that, up to now, Ryouko had only ever seen in speculative physics. A spectacular display of high‐energy EM radiation, bright enough to be worth comment even on its own, rounded off the show, demonstrating that the amount of energy used in the wormhole opening was at least an order of magnitude beyond even the most powerful starship weapons.

Finally, as the radiation dimmed, it became apparent that objects were appearing within the region of space that constituted the wormhole opening: blink cannons, heavy carriers, battlecruisers, and other capital ships, along with thousands of smaller ships that couldn\'t be identified at this distance with their sensors.

It was Misa that broke the silence:

\"So what now?\" she asked, voice quiet, turning towards Nadya. \"What do we do? We haven\'t practiced for this.\"

They hadn\'t. While this particular scenario had been included on the list of possible complications, it was considered unlikely enough to warrant low priority for direct simulation. They simply hadn\'t had time to get to it.

The group of them, even the ship\'s captain and pilot, turned to face Nadya and Clarisse, who happened to be standing together. By virtue of seniority, they were the undisputed leaders of the mission, and the crew of the ship was expected to defer to Major Antipova.

\"Our orders in this situation remain unchanged,\" Nadya said. \"We observe the situation, and if we think we see an opportunity, we go. Nothing changes; not for us.\"

To Ryouko, it seemed as if she were making a special effort to appear level and authoritative, turning her head so that she made eye contact with every team member, making sure they saw her gaze.

Every team member except Clarisse or Misa, that was. Clearly, Nadya expected them to remain firm without any additional encouragement. It was in these kinds of things that one could discern the makeup of a team.

Clarisse, for her part, was staring into the middle distance, wearing the blank look emblematic of someone focusing most of her attention on something internal. Ryouko wondered: Was she consulting some internal interface, or something magical?

\"We have to move in now,\" she said abruptly and incisively, turning to face them. \"We have to move immediately.\"

Where Nadya\'s look had been calming and firm, the commanding gaze of a Veteran, Clarisse\'s gaze was the fiery, willful stare of an Ancient, the look that dared anything and anyone to cross her path. After having seen it multiple times, from different girls, Ryouko had come to think of it as the \"I\'ve lived through five hundred years of shit, this nonsense is not going to bring me down\" look.

Some of the other girls visibly quailed, before Clarisse, apparently having realized she was doing something wrong, blinked the look away, adjusting her tone to be less harsh and more level, while still carrying a strong undertone of authority.

\"Alien reinforcements are pouring through the wormhole,\" she explained. \"If they\'re smart, they will already be reconstituting their fleet patrols around the stabilizer. Right now is probably the least defended it will ever be. We have to either move now, or not go at all. And I think, given the situation, we have to make the attempt.\"

\"She\'s right,\" Nadya said, without missing a beat. \"I don\'t think it makes sense to wait. We were on the verge of going anyway, until this* happened. The moment isn\'t quite perfect, but I don\'t think perfect is ever going to show up for us.\"

For a moment Ryouko was reminded of the attack on her transport ship, what seemed like an eternity ago. There, with their lives in danger, she had felt obligated to take leadership, because she wasn\'t sure who else would. Here, there would be none of that. They had a chain of command.

With Nadya\'s comment, the discussion was over. The pilot nodded, turning his head back towards the front to initiate the insertion. Raven said a farewell, dissolving her avatar so that she could focus on the mission at hand. The crew members dispersed back to their posts, while the MagOps team continued to stand around nervously, with the exception of Juliet, the stealth generator, who peered at the rest of them, then walked off to join Mohammad at the stealth controls. They knew that in such situations she preferred to be alone, so no one followed her.

It wasn\'t realistic to ask one magical girl to personally cloak the entire ship, not for the entire duration of the mission, but it was definitely possible for such a girl, focusing intently and with careful coordination, to detect and correct any problems with the ship\'s technological stealth, or even to apply some magic to enhance it during critical moments. In a well‐guarded area like the vicinity of the wormhole stabilizer, it was certainly not an easy task, and Juliet would be spending the rest of the mission huddled next to Mohammad, soul gem placed near an ample supply of grief cubes to deal with the strain.

Of course, it would be advantageous to have tactical stealth while on the ground, but they couldn\'t bring Juliet, who would stay on the ship. Even without her, however, their team had considerable concealment abilities distributed between the various members: Zheng Ying‐zhi could tune her barrier into a pretty good group invisibility, Annabelle could grant anyone in physical contact with her temporary---*very temporary---*incorporeality, and Gracia was capable of blotting the team\'s presence out of the awareness of any enemy minds in the area, including AIs. That wasn\'t even counting Clarisse, who had informed everyone that now that she was getting close to the wormhole, she had access to at least one variant of excellent group stealth, though, as she put it, she might not have precise mastery over its use.

Generally speaking, stealth wasn\'t even expected to be that useful on this mission. Unfortunately, the very nature of what they were attacking guaranteed that both sides knew what the likely targets were, and further guaranteed that the locations they\'d be going would be heavily defended, crisscrossed with sensors, and packed with alien personnel. Magical stealth was good, but without full incorporeality, it was risky to rely on it in an environment where even a single misstep might trigger a veritable potpourri of booby traps. They had tried it in the simulations, and it generally worked better to just go in guns blazing.

The team was well‐stocked with experienced veterans, all of whom had numerous tricks up their sleeve. It made Ryouko feel a bit... under‐experienced. She simply hadn\'t been contracted long enough to work on developing her powers, though she had been diligently reading the training recommendations. Teleporters tended to develop clairvoyance relatively easily, apparently, because the vast majority of teleporters instinctively exerted limited clairvoyance to ensure their landing spot was safe---the only exception was a few rare teleporters who needed line‐of‐sight with wherever they were going. Similarly, it was recommended that Ryouko focus on easing the restrictions on her current teleportation, using various tricks to try to get around the requirement that she had to always teleport herself, or the shape restrictions on what she was teleporting, and so forth. Alternatively, because she was adept at teleporting objects through touch, she might try to develop other contact‐based abilities, which included such advanced techniques as moving only the electrons to create an electrical spark.

Thus far, she had only succeeded in somewhat increasing her mass conveyance limit, a feat she felt she could be justifiably proud of.

\"Let\'s go to the recreation room,\" Nadya suggested, shooing the other girls out of pilot\'s area. \"We shouldn\'t be underfoot here.\"

They ended up sitting or reclining in various locations around the room, which was better‐equipped than its equivalent on most other frigates, sporting more beds and entertainment consoles. None of them were in the mood for entertainment, though, so instead they held awkward, halting conversation. There was a nervous mood in the air, and collectively the tension was far more palpable than it had been during most of the simulations. At this stage of the insertion, all they could do was wait---everything counted on the skill of their support crew, of Raven and her pilot in avoiding any potential hazards, of Mohammad and Juliet in keeping their detectable emissions to an absolute minimum, going so far as to even reroute particles and photons from one side of the ship to the other. They knew from briefings that they\'d be facing down powerful sensor arrays, plentiful drones, minefields, and even clouds of smart dust, designed to radiate brightly upon unexpected contact with a large object.

It was the fact that they had to sit around that was the worst part, and most of them made do by fiddling with their personal hardware---Nadya with a set of monoatomic needle blades, Misa with a portable reactor, shock gauntlets, and pack of railgun slugs, Annabelle with R‒15 Repeller explosives, and so forth. Ryouko, for her part, was packing a variety of explosives, both remote detonable and contact sensitive. Taking some advice from Mina, the other teleporter, she was also bringing a pair of daggers, laser‐cutter gauntlets, and a small, personalized carbine---something suited to her hands, not the bulky monstrosities carried by the infantry. Teleporters didn\'t really need mobility assistance or keep‐away devices---they needed ways to deal damage and, in Ryouko\'s case, close‐range damage.

\"You know, back during the Unification Wars, I was in a few missions myself,\" Clarisse said, swiveling her head to look over the group. "People would tell each other stories. You girls know any?\"

They stared back at her blankly.

Clarisse put her fist to her mouth, making a show of clearing her throat, as the others leaned in slightly.

\"This is a bit of a morality story, I guess,\" she began.

\"Two starving citizens are foraging for food, when they spot in the distance the glimmer of the newly constructed city of El Dorado. One of them, a former History Professor, comments to the other:\"

\"\'You know, there was once this rich Roman named Marcus Crassus. His greed was notorious, he ruthlessly exploited the poor, and he owned countless slaves. You know how he died?\'\"

\"\'How?\' the other asked, a little annoyed, since he was getting tired of hearing these stories.\"

\"\'He got greedy for what he didn\'t have. He was the only prominent politician at the time without any military success. He used his wealth to fund an invasion of Parthia, a disaster that cost both him and his son their lives. According to legend, the Parthians killed him by pouring liquid gold into his mouth, so that his desire for wealth could finally be satiated.\'\"

\"The other man grunts, and says:\"

\"\'I\'m not impressed. Look at those bastards in the city over there. You think they\'re going to drown in their gold? I wouldn\'t count on it.\'\"

\"\'Karma works in strange ways, my friend,\' the other man replies.\"

\"A while later, by a coincidence, they return to same spot, only to see a bright flash in the distance. Before they realize what\'s going on, they see a gigantic mushroom cloud rising from the distant city. They stand there, and watch a while, and finally the skeptical one says:\"

\"\'I guess you were right after all. They got the fate of Crassus.\'\"

\"The professor smiles slightly and says:\"

\"\'No, they didn\'t. This is better. It\'s not just the mouth.\'\"

Clarisse watched them, expression deadpan.

A moment later, Misa began laughing hysterically, lying down and rolling in her cot, enough that Ryouko was briefly concerned she would knock over her equipment.

Finally realizing what was expected of them, the others chuckled nervously and awkwardly, clearly more a show of politeness than anything. Gracia looked faintly disgusted. To Ryouko, the humor seemed a bit... off‐color.

\"You shouldn\'t have tried that,\" Nadya said, rebuking Clarisse lightly. \"This generation is far too puritanical to enjoy that kind of humor. Besides, it\'s a terrible joke.\"

\"I didn\'t really think it would work,\" Clarisse said, looking off into a corner. \"But I just thought I would break the tension. It really was a popular story, back during the war. People loved it. Look, *she loves it.\"

She pointed at Misa, who had finally recovered enough to sit back upright, coughing slightly.

\"If that\'s the quality of joke you\'re going to tell, maybe we should play some board games instead,\" Nadya said dryly. \"We could play chess or something.\"

\"That old solved game?\" Annabelle asked skeptically.

\"You\'re not supposed to look up the answers while playing,\" Nadya said, glaring at the girl. \"It\'s honor system.\"

\"You only want to play it because you\'re better than any of us,\" Misa commented, shaking her head mock‐sadly. \"Honestly, trying to play board games with someone as old as you is just asking for it.\"

\"It\'s just because you don\'t take it seriously enough.\"

\"It\'s a game! We\'re leaving the ship in seventeen minutes!\"

Watching the exchange, Ryouko\'s eyes slid from Nadya\'s affronted expression over to Clarisse, who was smiling slightly. She wondered if Clarisse really was as \"bad\" with jokes as she had appeared.

Clarisse stood up, cracking her knuckles for no reason that Ryouko could discern.

\"Five minutes, lightning chess,\" she said, addressing Nadya. \"Let\'s do this.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fortunately, the imminence of their \"drop\" was enough to put a limit on Nadya\'s post‐game grumbling about the time control. As they assembled their equipment, a silence naturally settled over the group, and Nadya dropped her disaffected face like a mask, returning to the serious, vaguely detached look that characterized her in combat situations.

So far so good. The very fact that they were still alive proved they had yet to be detected. Only five more minutes and they would enter orbit around the wormhole stabilizer---another three and they would be in position.

As subtly as she could, Ryouko swallowed. She didn\'t think of herself as cowardly, but at the moment she felt herself hoping desperately that they could make it back. That would require two things: that they successfully complete their mission, and that she and Gracia Perez both survive the mission. She did not ordinarily need a clairvoyant at her side to find her way on a teleport, but it would be necessary in this case, with the kind of stealth *HSS Raven* would be under. Furthermore, it would be impossible for Raven to maintain a stationary position relative to the facility---even achieving such a position momentarily for the upcoming insertion would be a difficult maneuver. Even if she could *see* where to teleport, that would be useless without a reliable way to signal the ship---such as might be provided by a telepath with extremely long‐range, like Gracia. It was also possible for her to teleport near the ship and signal it from there, but they would be pressing their luck more than enough as it is.

Reaching for the enchanted armor they had been given, she froze.

*Clarisse, did you say something?* she asked her TacComp.

*No. And that\'s the kind of question you should never have to ask me.*

She frowned, but proceeded to pick up the armor, holding it in one hand. She had already practiced this multiple times, but no matter how many times she did it, she couldn\'t quite convince herself the armor would really integrate correctly with her costume, the equipment bag on her back, and the gauntlets, even if the armor did seem to pulse with a faint trace of magic.

She unwrapped the piece of smart‐fabric she had been using to cover her soul gem---the excessive glowing during an FTL trip could be annoying---and almost instantly covered it again, instinctively. The glow had been searingly bright, brighter than she had ever seen it, bright enough to briefly cast the entire room in a pale shade of green.

\"No offense,\" Misa said, \"but I hope it\'s not going to do that the whole mission.\"

\"Try dimming it,\" Clarisse said.

\"What?\" Ryouko asked, blinking.

\"Dim it,\" Clarisse repeated. \"Just think that you want your soul gem to stop glowing for a while. It\'s what I\'m doing; otherwise mine would be driving us all crazy. I can taste how close we are.\"

Ryouko, who had literally never before considered the possibility, took a breath and willed her soul gem to dim its glow---and she felt it respond, so that she knew even before she removed the fabric that it would be normal again.

\"Why now?\" Gracia asked out loud. \"It\'s supposed to respond to FTL engines. We\'ve been next to one for an hour. Why is it brighter now?\"

Zheng Ying‐zhi pointed behind her with her thumb, at---well, a bulkhead, but implicitly something outside the ship.

\"It\'s not an FTL engine, but that thing out there is certainly something.*\"

Ryouko kept her thoughts to herself, trying to stay focused. But the ring---it definitely bothered her.

She took a breath, then transformed, allowed herself to do what came naturally, the magic flowing over the enchanted suit, reacting with it, and---

Suddenly, she found herself looking out the inside of a transparent visor. Not the fiber optic relay favored by most infantry armor---an actual visor, so that magical girls could see straight out, a combat consideration important enough to weaken the armor in a critical region, given the surprising number of powers that were dependent on direct line‐of‐sight.

Ryouko turned to face the others, the armor literally weightless on her body. Standard armor, made of ultra‐dense metamaterial, was too bulky to wear, the internal servos too slow to keep pace with her reaction time, but this was *magical* armor, and didn\'t have those limitations. It was too bad these kinds of armors took so much time and dedicated effort to make.

She didn\'t like the appearance of the armor, though, which, even though it eliminated the dress she normally wore, still managed to invoke the same aesthetic, with plenty of perfectly frivolous protrusions and extensions serving as decoration.

Sighing, she had the armor extrude a grief cube to the location of her soul gem, holding the cube in place under the armor, which was extra‐thick in that area, though you couldn\'t tell looking at it from outside. She waited until she was sure the gem was over‐primed, then returned the still partly‐empty grief cube to storage.

Magitech armor. It was convenient.

The others were already ready, waiting for her to prepare herself. Gracia was already scanning the approaching moon with her clairvoyance, searching it for a good initial insertion point. It was unfortunate that the vast majority of clairvoyants were vision‐only; alien sensor interference prevented them from getting a precise lock on gravity distortions at even this close distance. That was not even counting the giant distortion that was the wormhole itself, perfectly capable of driving poorly‐calibrated sensors wild.

There. They had now reached low orbit, though they would not linger here, as the ship needed to drop lower, low enough that the facility was within Ryouko\'s teleportation range, while simultaneously eliminating any relative velocity it had with the ground, working its engines to avoid going into freefall. Only after the team was gone would it push itself forward, achieving the horizontal velocity necessary to hold orbit.

\"I can only imagine the level of surveillance they must have around us,\" Annabelle said, gesturing around her, the suits relaying the audio in and out. \"If it weren\'t for Juliet, we\'d have already been vaporized.\"

The others nodded, faces visible through their visors, then approached to make the necessary physical contact.

Ryouko took a breath, dispelling tension she could feel coiling inside her. This wait was interminable.

*I think I have something,* Gracia thought. *It looks important enough to blow up. That\'s all I can promise at this point.*

Ryouko took another breath, doing her best to internalize the details of the location Gracia was displaying telepathically to the group, a large white and gray room full of strange, bulbous computing equipment and unarmored alien personnel. Ryouko would be burning her reserves just making the jump, so she was expected to actively rest after the insertion, but the rest of the group needed to actively plan what they would do, and what powers they would use, updating the group interface with the information.

*We\'re at insertion position,* the captain announced, what seemed like an eternity later. *Give or take a meter per second or so. Relatively. You know the drill.*

She looked around at the rest of the group, and they nodded at each other.

She closed her eyes, holding in mind the image being projected to her by Gracia. She reached across the distance, a distance so great she had to strain, forcing herself through the gap, reaching, until something tore---

There was no room for error. Even in a human base, it simply wasn\'t possible to knock out part of the facility without putting everything on alert. They had to move hard, and they had to move fast, lest the aliens catch their breath. Everything was possible---and had happened before, on different missions---including the aliens voluntarily detonating a large part of their own base, hiding the rest behind powerful internal forcefields. The last tactic had stopped being used after human MagOps teams had learned to blink out at the first sign of a major nuclear or antimatter detonation, but it meant that both Ryouko and Mina, the other teleporter, had to stay on constant hair‐trigger alert, always ready to gather the entire team and leave at a moment\'s notice.

At the moment, that last statement applied mostly to Mina, since Ryouko was still heavily in the grips of necessary soul gem recharge, leaning on her knees, the world seeming to swirl slightly around her as the suit fed her grief cubes. At the moment, she had to rely on the others.

The others had not wasted a single moment, each contributing whatever they could to the group defense at the moment of insertion, after they collectively canceled their remaining relative velocity with basic telekinesis. Ying‐zhi had thrown up a barrier around the entire team, with a bit of stealth added for good measure, shimmering gold casting the entire scene around in sharp relief. Misa\'s attack was more invisible, but likely just as effective, emitting a massive electromagnetic pulse to disable whatever she could in the area, her body floating off the ground slightly. Eva, who was already crouching, detonated the ground in a ring around them, on the theory that more explosions was always good, as long as they weren\'t pointed at you.

The others carried out more specific responses, responding to threats as Gracia identified them, multiple telekinetic pulses and explosive rifle shots emanating outward in the space of a few seconds. Clarisse dispensed with the pleasantry of holding back her power, identifying targets herself while rapidly firing magical beams from her fingers.

In short, it was a scene of utter destructive chaos outside the barrier, and even with vision of the full EM spectrum, it was difficult for Ryouko to make out anything through the cloud of explosive shrapnel, crisscrossing beams, and equipment discharging electricity. Only Gracia and Clarisse\'s inputs to the team\'s area awareness gave her any semblance of what was outside---that, and the vision of the room she had been given earlier.

Then, a few seconds later, it was over. To conserve power, everyone except Ying‐zhi removed their area defenses, and Nadya made a gesture with both hands, clearing the area of smoke with one large gust of wind.

The devastation was total. In a circular ring around where they had landed, the ground and ceiling had been seared black, and the heavy reinforced wall was nearly gone entirely, scattered piles of smoking, still‐melting debris the only testament to its previous existence. On the ground, ruined equipment lay in large chunks, along with piles of blackened corpses that couldn\'t even easily be identified as human or alien. The smell of it all offended Ryouko\'s nostrils, which automatically diverted anything acrid enough to be damaging. The rest merely confirmed her visual observations: the burnt byproducts of a thousand different constituents burning, organic, metallic, plastic, ceramic.

On one side of the room, the shattered remains of what had once been a transparent observation window led to a large spherical cavity, carrying a floating gray sphere the size of a house---the sight was familiar from the simulations. Something about the sphere seemed slightly *off*, almost as if parts of it looked farther away than they should. Genuine gravitational distortions, or a cheap metamaterial imitation placed as a decoy? It was difficult to tell.

A slight shimmering indicated the presence of an alien forcefield, and if this particular structure was the correct target, it would be a forcefield strong enough to deflect everything short of a nuclear attack---and even the weakest nukes, for that matter. If it were authentic, it was their job to destroy it, once they were sure the area was secure.

Ryouko felt her soul gem, buried under the armor of her suit, viscerally throbbing.* Somewhere, deep within her, she felt---were the gravitational distortions within the stabilizer facility *this* intense?

She looked up at the ceiling above her head, now patterned with burn marks, but instead of looking at that, she felt compelled to look through* it somehow, to smash through it and fly upward with powers she did not have.

*Ryouko,* her TacComp thought, sharp and loud in her ear, and Ryouko came out of her reverie, realizing with embarrassment that she had lost her focus at a moment such as this.

*Did the alien scientists know if this core is legitimate?* Nadya asked, directing the question at Gracia, the group telepath.

*No,* she responded. *As expected.*

The others had already settled into their roles. Gracia continued surveillance, as Nadya and Eva immediately deployed their gravimetric sensor packs. The long‐distance teleport had drained her reserves, but now Ryouko felt herself slowly regaining power, and though she now kept an iron grip on her attention, trying to maintain her focus, a part of her speculated on the unarmored aliens they had just massacred: Were they scientists? Technicians? Were such specializations even relevant to the squid?

No matter; they were working on the wormhole stabilizer, which was all that mattered.

*Two heavy laser emplacements preparing to fire,* Gracia thought, the first explicit combat communication since they had inserted. One turret was at the other side of a long claustrophobic corridor that extended from one of the gaping, ruined walls, while the other, also distant, was concealed behind one of the side walls that had managed to survive the previous devastation. Alien facilities were all designed so that there was a relatively clear line of fire from at least one such weapon into every single nook and cranny, so the news was not surprising---the only question was how to deal with it.

Annabelle moved in to take care of the one at the end of the corridor, raising her sniper rifle---the magical one, which was an ornate white and blue, with flower prints.

*I\'ll deal with the other one,* Misa thought, waving off Mina Guyure, who had been moving to take care of it.

Before the others could comment, she stepped directly into the line of fire, palm raised. That alone was unusual---Misa usually never bothered to move her body parts to channel her magic.

In the next moment, Annabelle fired, the shell\'s exit velocity so fast that even their enhanced senses couldn\'t begin to track it. At the far end of the corridor, the laser turret shuddered, exploding into a shower of metal pieces before bursting into flame. It clearly wouldn\'t be firing anything.

Ryouko knew from previous conversations what had happened, though. Heavy laser turrets all had a relatively strong forcefield for protection, so in the ordinary course of things, Annabelle\'s relatively weak magical projectile wouldn\'t have had much effect. This, however, was where her magical ability came into play, allowing her to briefly render herself or anything she was touching incorporeal. A special exception clause in her power description allowed her to also apply this to projectiles fired from a weapon she was carrying. The duration of this ability was terribly low---milliseconds, actually---but it was more than sufficient for a sniper bullet to bypass a forcefield. That was, of course, its intended purpose.

In the next moment, the other laser fired, the rare x‐rays that scattered off the air appearing resplendent in Ryouko\'s enhanced vision. It accomplished little, though, because Misa *fired back, melting and shattering the wall in front of her. The two beams, each about the diameter of a soccer ball, met head‐on, canceling in a spectacular burst of diverted energy that saturated the area with a torrent of radiation. For a moment, the radiation output dazzled Ryouko\'s vision---but then Ying‐zhi grunted, retuning her barrier, and the radiation faded.

*Yes, it is possible for two lasers to cancel,* Clarisse thought, before Ryouko even thought the question. *If the two beams are exactly out‐of‐phase. That can\'t really be done with two lasers going in opposite directions---she must be doing something very exotic with the collision point.*

Ryouko hadn\'t seen her do it before, even in simulation. Had she simply never bothered to log this particular use of her abilities in the databanks?

Smiling manically, Misa leaned forward, appearing to physically drive the laser forward. As she poured more and more energy into the beam, the point of intersection began to shift away from her, moving faster and faster. As it progressed, the rounded walls of the corridor beyond the melted wall, thoroughly irradiated, glowed in Ryouko\'s vision, dumping radiation back into their surroundings.

Finally, Misa forced the beam back into the laser cannon itself, which had emerged from a large opening in the wall at the end of the corridor. A small forcefield defending the laser struggled briefly, glowing frantically bright in an attempt to dissipate the energy, and then failed. Then came the bright flare of an explosion, the laser cannon detonating so violently the ground shook slightly.

*There were a lot of unarmored alien personnel sealed in the rooms along the corridor,* Gracia thought, seemingly awestruck. *The radiation has mostly killed them. And that explosion---an infantry squad was trying to deploy down that corridor, with the laser providing covering fire. I don\'t think they expected that.*

Misa just smirked slightly.

*Of course not. I didn\'t need to be so showy, but you labeled the interface with their approach, so I thought I\'d take care of it. Of course, they\'re not all dead yet.*

In response to that, Mina extruded a rounded metal object from within her suit---a modded anti‐personnel mine. She seemed to regard it for a moment, as an indicator light flashed on, indicating it was armed---then it disappeared, as if it had never been there at all, leaving not even the trace optical distortion Ryouko knew she left behind when teleporting.

A moment later, Gracia confirmed through the area awareness that the remaining infantry were dead. It had been one minute since Ryouko had teleported in.

Compared to Ryouko, Mina had a much shorter teleportation range---but, unlike Ryouko, she was not required to personally accompany all of her teleports. Ryouko felt a moment of jealousy. On this mission, she was explicitly forbidden from venturing anywhere on her own, even on split‐second bombing runs. It was too risky for the team\'s only way off the moon.

They returned to their positions, staying on the alert, away from the two corridors and their clear lines‐of‐fire. Under the protective cover of Gracia\'s clairvoyance, it was doubtful that there were any threats out there to fear, but it didn\'t hurt to be careful. Carelessness was what got you a bullet in the head from a stealthed sniper, an injury that even a magical girl couldn\'t keep fighting through.

Despite the trace of showboating that could be sensed in Misa\'s demeanor, they all knew that had there been no approaching infantry squad, she would never have wasted so much energy on merely looking cool. Indeed, even as they were discussing the issue, Misa\'s grief cube storage ticked downward by two.

*Well, I\'ve got mixed news,* Nadya thought. *Mostly bad, though.*

They stayed at their positions, taking in the news silently. The good news was that, according to the sensors, they had gotten very lucky---they had landed on their very first try on a major concentrated source of gravitational distortions, of the sort that even the aliens couldn\'t afford to build a dozen decoys of---or so they had thought, but here they were staring at twelve of them on their local sensors.

By studying the distortions in the sky above them, it was at least possible to count how many of sources were real, even if alien sensor interference prevented proper localization. Based on the wormhole stabilizer in the Saharan system, the expectation was that there would be one source---but instead there were four. They knew that they were standing next to one of them, but the other three, obscured behind exotic matter reactors, were impossible to distinguish from the decoys without getting close.

*Is it possible they constructed four of these cores?* Annabelle asked, sounding slightly bewildered. *These things are supposed to be expensive! We only brought two PAYNE devices!*

*We don\'t know if they\'re authentic,* Clarisse thought. *But it also doesn\'t matter much. If we can\'t tell the difference, we have to keep destroying them until we\'ve shut down the wormhole, and to be safe, we should probably destroy all of them. But... if there are any decoys, then it is very likely that the one we\'re standing next to is authentic. I have---I get very lucky in situations such as this, whenever my allies or I must make a random choice. There\'s no other real way to describe it. It\'s one of my powers.*

She sounded almost reluctant to discuss the issue, and Ryouko realized that in all her reading, she had never heard about this particular power of Clarisse\'s. Was it somehow a secret?

*Are you sure?* Nadya asked.

*Yes,* Clarisse thought, suddenly decisive. *If there is only one authentic core, it is this one. We should use a PAYNE device on it. With any luck---and this time, I mean the kind of luck that\'s beyond my control---it will be the only one and we will be done. Either way, we must move quickly. The longer we stand here, the higher the chance the aliens will think of a way to hurt us without damaging the core behind us.*

*Do it,* Nadya thought, without further elaboration.

Annabelle disgorged the device from the bulky pack on her back, the robotic arm of the pack gingerly placing the smooth spherical device, about twice the size of her head, into her hands.

The **P**ortable **A**djustable **Y**ield **N**uclear **E**xplosive was one of the most compact nuclear weapons ever manufactured by humans. An antimatter‐triggered pure fusion device, it could be calibrated to deliver a yield of anywhere from twenty kilotons to one megaton of TNT, all in a terrifying, backpack‐sized package.

*Max it out,* Nadya thought.

*Are you sure?* Annabelle thought.

*The last time one of our teams tried to drop in here, they dropped a ten megaton warhead on top of their own base forcefields just to kill them. They wouldn\'t have done that if they weren\'t damn confident in the strength of their forcefields. This thing behind us might not be the main forcefield, but if this is the authentic core, you can be sure this thing is damn powerful.*

Annabelle nodded, swallowing and setting the device down, gingerly, next to the shattered window where the alien forcefield shimmered slightly. Ryouko knew that, at that moment, they were all thinking the same unspoken thought: if the aliens had, as expected, substantial inner base forcefields, then the blast would only destroy this part of the facility, and they would be safe teleporting to the other side of the facility.

If the aliens didn\'t, however, then that was excellent news for the overall mission of destroying the Stabilizer. It would also mean that Ryouko would be relied upon to perform a second, kilometers‐long teleport in the fractions of a second it would take for them to realize that they were about to be hit by a nuclear blast. Ying‐zhi could delay it for perhaps another second with her barrier, but that would be all that they got.

An alternative would have been to exit the facility entirely on the first shot, then teleport back if necessary, but that raised the possibility that they would trigger a distant booby trap, as might have happened to the first team. At least by staying within the facility, they knew that if they were killed by the blast, they would have the satisfaction of knowing that the facility was going down with them---and in the end, it was more important that the facility be destroyed than that they survive.

Again, Ryouko found her eyes drawn upward. She wondered: What did the wormhole look like, up close?

*Ryouko,* her TacComp thought again, loudly.

*Ah!* Ryouko thought, barely suppressing a startled jump.

*I think I\'m recharged enough to make the jumps,* she thought.

*Good,* Nadya thought, not seeming to have noticed her loss of focus. Arm the device as you leave. Three seconds should be enough, if you time it well.*

They didn\'t want to stick around here any longer than they had.

Arming the PAYNE device was trivial, provided one had the proper authorizations preloaded into one\'s implants, as they all did. A quick quantum key exchange, and the device was ready and armed.

Ying‐zhi knelt down next to the device, touching it. A moment later, a small golden barrier appeared around the device. It would persist just long enough to protect the device from any unexpected attempts to explosively disarm it.

The girl stood back up, taking a breath, flared yellow sleeves shifting around her arms. Ryouko took a breath, too, as the others gathered around her. Again, Gracia transferred an image into her mind, this time of another similar‐looking core on the far side of facility---but not the *farthest* one, as that would have likely been predictable. This room was shaped a bit different---it was substantially larger, with a much higher ceiling. Other than that, it was not much different from the room they were standing in---at least, the way it had looked before they arrived. There was the same alien personnel ambling about, holding pieces of equipment with their tentacle phalanges, and the same bulbous equipment and control panels. The only difference was that there now appeared to be several alien infantry squads, stationed at a surprising distance from the core itself.

Receiving the mental confirmation that this was the right place to go, Ryouko began charging her teleport.

In the last moment before she completed the jump, as she could already feel something starting to rip, she armed the device, setting it to three seconds, as she had been instructed. A timer appeared in the corner of her vision.

It had been two minutes since they first teleported into the facility.

They jumped.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This time around, they received a welcoming committee.

That was not unexpected. Not only did it stand to reason that the aliens would mobilize to defend the rest of the facility, but Gracia\'s clairvoyance had of course shown them some of the defenders beforehand.

The initial stages of their entrance were standard---Ying‐zhi immediately threw up a barrier, Misa performed an EMP, and Nadya blasted a wave of force outward, trying to clear the area. The barrier and telekinetic repulsion came in handy immediately, as a wave of fire and debris immediately assailed the group from all directions, the blast wave carrying enough energy to easily overcome the telekinesis and impact on the barrier, which glowed with a sharp golden light as it worked to deflect what was going on around them.

*Conventional blast,* Ryouko\'s TacComp informed her. *At this distance, the radiation should have arrived first, and there\'s been nothing significant yet. This is something else.*

So the alien base had strong internal shielding, as they had suspected.

A moment later, the ground underneath shook violently, the likely aftereffects of the nearby nuclear explosion.

Even before the smoke cleared, the barrier came under a storm of laser and projectile fire. Each individual impact caused that part of the barrier to flare with light, large ripples traveling outward, as if from a stone dropped into a pool of water. There were so many impacts, however, that the glow of the barrier was once again nearly uniform, and the surface of the barrier was a storm of interference patterns.

Ryouko\'s eyes automatically cycled through the electromagnetic spectrum, searching for a frequency on which she could discern anything useful about their surroundings, but every frequency was blotted out with far too much radiation to effectively see---more than just relying on the natural infrared afterglow of the explosion and the ultraviolet of their lasers, the aliens were clearly using a blinding device as well.

It was not a big issue, though; Gracia, who was using her clairvoyance and telepathy to maintain a form of generalized combat awareness, had already informed them what the situation was---the explosions, which had come from EMP‐hardened explosive devices, had served to deliberately demolish around them a wide, nearly hundred‐meter section of the facility. Now they stood completely in the open, the holes in the floors above them forming a tower of concentric circles, culminating in a roof open to the starry sky and Orpheus above. Through the opening, the alien wormhole, visible through Gracia\'s clairvoyance as a bright spherical distortion in the stars above, seemed still resolutely intact.

A shower of debris and dust, the aftereffects of the explosion, continued to break off and fall downward, some of it peppering Ying‐zhi\'s barrier, as the nearby superstructure of the facility trembled under the combined effects of the distant nuclear blast and the adjacent conventional explosion.

At the very bottom of the devastated area, next to where they were standing, lay the putative stabilizer core, perfectly intact within its powerful forcefield. It was no longer surrounded by a spherical metallic shell, instead continuing to levitate easily in its former position---apparently everything important about the core, forcefield generator and all, was contained within the smooth, floating metal sphere. It was, in many ways, an elegant design---but there was no time to stand around appreciating it.

There were now five separate alien infantry squads firing down at them from elevated cover, carefully prepositioned, along with their accompanying escort drones, both aerial and otherwise. Not a good position to be in, in other words.

But of course, they had two teleporters---three, if you counted Clarisse, who moonlighted as one---and that was more than sufficient tactical mobility.

*Clear them out!* Ying‐zhi exhorted, arms raised. *Standing here like this isn\'t exactly pleasant!*

The command was unnecessary, though, since they were already moving, and this time, Ryouko had sufficient power to actually participate.

Following the battle plan presented to their minds by their TacComps, one long ago decided upon for this kind of situation, they moved out, dividing into fireteams. Mina, Misa, Gracia, and Annabelle teleported upward, seeking out the squad with the best firing position. Nadya and Clarisse sought out the squad least well‐covered by what would be Misa\'s new position, and Ryouko, Ying‐zhi, and Eva sought out one of the squads on the lower levels, the one most likely to come under direct fire.

Ryouko had little time to pay attention to what was going on elsewhere, immediately grabbing hold of her assigned partners and teleporting out. It was necessary to assume that the others would do what was tasked of them---that Misa would effectively eliminate the aerial drone population, that Gracia would seize mental control of as many of the uppermost infantry squad as she could, that Nadya and Clarisse would effectively destroy the squad they were tasked to.

Ryouko\'s group also had a straightforward kill‐and‐destroy mission. Appearing in the shadows behind their assigned squad, Ying‐zhi slammed her barrier immediately downward, in an effort to disable the anti‐personnel smart mines and sacrificial drones that alien infantry squads liberally covered their rears with. Some of them detonated anyway, peppering the barrier with shrapnel, but most were rudely flung aside as the barrier plowed into the alloy flooring.

In these confined quarters, using an explosive bolt would have risked bringing the roof down upon them, along with other possible unpleasant effects. As such, Ryouko had prepared a more conventional attack, one of her most‐favored combinations: tossing a set of grenades to try to overload shielding, following by a small set of stringed crossbow bolts---now modified with a bit of stickiness---then a single, short‐range teleport, barely more than a centimeter, which was more than enough to disassemble practically anything.

She smiled grimly as her attack had the intended effect, sending three alien troopers immediately to the floor as critical organs and suit functions were severed, green ichor and clear hydraulic fluid gushing out of the various fracture planes.

She then performed a follow‐on teleport, shifting her position to the other side of the infantrymen she had just killed, timing her movement so it would dodge the laser fire that would immediately come from the alien squad\'s escort drones, as well as the explosive \"death shrapnel\" typically emitted by deceased alien infantry---a special trap for careless magical girls, particularly of the melee class. She then fired a series of quick, magically aimed arbalest bolts, easily destroying the drones that had revealed their positions---even the aliens couldn\'t afford to put forcefields on *everything.*

Simultaneously, Eva Guderian snapped her whip outward, the weapon snaking sinuously to its desired target, a point on the ground where the troopers were slightly concentrated. That part of the ground immediately detonated, its explosive force carefully controlled by Eva to maximize damage while minimizing the risk of unintended effects---the difference between the controlled explosion of a specialist, and Ryouko\'s more careless explosive bolts. Several squadsmen fell to the floor, two of them literally in pieces, tentacle limbs writhing uncontrollably, detached from the main body.

Ryouko teleported forward, briefly touching the bodies of the dead. Executing a lightning‐fast double blink, she carried the bodies with her into the middle of a group of alien squadsmen, then blinked back alone, before they had time to respond.

They paused, waiting for the damaged alien suits to disgorge the inevitable wave of death shrapnel, which Ryouko had now ensured would strafe the alien shields, rather than any of them. Ryouko temporarily dismissed her arbalest, rapidly drawing her carbine to suppress the enemy with a series of railgun bursts, while incidentally disabling a few of the support drones still crawling along the ceiling and walls. Ying‐zhi, with her *chu‐ko‐nu,* sprayed magical bolts rapid fire instead---the barrier generator\'s weapon was very similar to Ryouko\'s, but had a much higher rate of fire, which was what was called for at the moment.

A moment later, the death‐shrapnel detonated from the enemy suits, peppering the alien shields and signaling Ying‐zhi to slam her hands forward expressively, and her barrier changed configuration, snapping forward into a shrinking inverted parabola that rapidly shoved the alien infantrymen together into a small, disoriented group. Ryouko fired a weak explosive bolt directly into the concentration of infantry suits, using the concussion to further weaken their shields and stun their reactions.

Eva then dashed forward, relying on the other two to suppress or disable with crossbow bolts any drones that might be defending the area.

Even Ryouko thought Eva\'s preferred melee technique rather gruesome, the girl sliding in between squad members with her superior speed, slamming her palms through forcefield after forcefield with a blurry of arm thrusts and footwork that always reminded Ryouko of martial arts masters she had seen in movies. Each palm strike was accompanied with a burst of magic that broke through the aliens\' weakened shielding, enabling Eva to make direct physical contact with their suits, so she could *detonate* the suits themselves, directing the explosions away from her and into Ying‐zhi\'s barrier on the other side. The alien infantry trapped within the area fell apart almost comically, resembling nothing so much as a group of hapless, if explosive, bowling pins. Since the suits had been entirely destroyed, there was no shrapnel to worry about.

Squinting slightly, Ryouko picked off attack drones still trying to attack their barrier with meaningless lasers, firing crossbow bolts with an accuracy that, in a past life, she would have never credited. Ying‐zhi, for her part, also swept the area with a series of partial barriers, clearing any mini‐drones that might be attempting anything nefarious.

It was now five minutes since they had teleported into the facility.

With the job complete, Ryouko and Ying‐zhi moved forward, joining Eva near the broken edge where the explosion had carved a hole in the facility. Looking out onto the other floors, they sought other targets, but they found that there was little left to do. From their perch high above Ryouko\'s position, a torrent of laser fire was raining down from the alien personnel that Gracia had mind‐controlled, filling the air with the characteristic popping noise of laser fire impacting metal, forcefields, and bodies. A quieter, rhythmic snapping indicated Annabelle\'s merciless, methodical sniping, something she knew from the simulations that only a magical girl was capable of escaping. Misa contributed by magically firing a steady barrage of the small railgun projectiles she had carried with her.

They had been too late to see what had happened to the alien squad perched on the high ground on the other side of the chasm, but they could easily see it from their combat records. From the other side of the chasm, standing behind a barrier helpfully erected by Clarisse, Nadya had unceremoniously moved the ground out from under the enemy squad, snapping the metal flooring and dropping it straight into the chasm below.

Of course, alien infantry were, generally speaking, all equipped with short‐range antigrav packs, sufficient for quickly changing elevations, and even human powered armor was sufficient to survive intact falling from such a relatively low height. Thus, simply tearing the floor out from under them was insufficient to produce a kill. It did, however, cause tremendous confusion, destroy whatever cover they had, and force them to rapidly toggle their antigrav controls. That had been more than enough for all the assorted laser beams, railguns, and magical projectiles arrayed against them to do their work.

\"That\'ll do for all of them,\" Eva said, a short while later, glancing at Ryouko, engaging in a bit of rare open speech. Far above them, Misa and the others in her group engaged in the gruesome work of executing the squid infantrymen that Gracia had mind‐controlled---she simply didn\'t have the stamina necessary to maintain control much longer.

\"That was a pretty good job back there, rookie.\"

Ryouko looked back at the other girl, who was peering into the chasm with a serious expression. \"Rookie\"---no one on the team had called her that since the earliest simulations, but she knew why it made sense to use the term now. She didn\'t really know Eva well---not as well as Juliet, Annabelle, or Gracia, anyway---but they had been part of the same team, which meant that even if they hadn\'t socialized much, Ryouko still respected her. Strange, that she thought herself closer to the taciturn Juliet, even if they had hardly ever spoken.

Even so, Ryouko was surprised to find that the comment warmed her heart slightly.

Down below them, the alien structure they had come to think of as a "core\" continued to hover silently, as serenely as if nothing had happened at all.

*My soul gem isn\'t reacting to it,* Ryouko realized suddenly.

*Incoming,* Gracia thought, from far above them.

Ryouko and her group immediately shifted deeper down the corridor, reducing their exposure to what was coming from above: two alien low altitude fighters, on air patrol over the facility, had homed in on them, doing what they could to aid their now fallen comrades.

A small torrent of lasers and missiles headed for the area, and they struggled to deflect the attacks. It wasn\'t a matter of direct personal protection---the fighters, having clearly been informed of the situation, were targeting structural supports. It was necessary to try and prevent further damage to the structure of the building around them, lest the attack trigger a precipitous structural collapse down upon their heads. They would survive, but the teleporters would waste precious time pulling the team out of the rubble, time during which they would be cut off from each other, likely forced to use their powers to avoid being crushed.

Ying‐zhi moved forward, deflecting what she could of the lasers heading for them---difficult from this distance. Ryouko shot down a couple of missiles, as the rest of the team did whatever they could---or, in the case of Eva, who was not particularly useful for this kind of confrontation, focused on staying protected.

Finally, once the initial wave was over, and the fighters circled out for another run---too canny to make themselves sitting ducks by hovering in place---the team made their counterattack. Nadya telekinetically grabbed hold of one craft, while Clarisse drew upon another of her exotic repertoire of powers, overriding the electronic controls of the other. With relatively minor forced adjustments to the trajectories of the two fighters, the two ships slammed directly into each other, far above the facility, forcefields failing almost immediately. Simple, efficient, satisfying---and quite explosive, the sound reverberating in the moon\'s relatively thick atmosphere.

She shifted her eyes up, at the nearly black alien sky. Maybe if she looked harder---

A mental warning abruptly seized her attention.

She turned around almost instantly, dashing forward with such a speed that any normal human would have been unable to see her move at all.

*Eva!* she shouted telepathically, to no one in particular, because the channel that connected Eva to the rest of the team seemed now permanently gone.

Only when she was already there, clutching the girl\'s lifeless body in one arm, did she realize that one of her own arms had been seriously injured, still operating only because the suit\'s hydraulics had taken over.

\"Damn it!\" Ying‐zhi spat out, immediately strengthening the barrier that had been covering their rear. \"Damn it, damn it, damn it! I was focusing too much on the front. I didn\'t think---\"

Ryouko just stared into the dead girl\'s eyes, open and lifeless. Her combat interface fed the details to her---a sniper, cloaked far in their rear, had patiently waited for its opportunity, had fired directly into Eva\'s lower back, had somehow known that was where the soul gem was, despite it being encased beneath the armor of the suit. A second shot, fired almost immediately afterward, had been at Ryouko\'s back, and only the fact that she had moved so rapidly, and the fact that her soul gem was in the front, had prevented anything more serious, causing the shot to hit her arm instead.

The sniper\'s position was now highlighted in her console, thanks to Gracia\'s clairvoyance. The emotions of the telepath washed over her, saying what didn\'t need to be said. She had lost her focus, fatigued with the exertion of performing a mind‐control and the need to watch the skies. Even Clarisse, who could have conceivably watched their rear, had been too busy dealing with the fighters.

*We should---* Ying‐zhi began, but Ryouko didn\'t hear her.

Ryouko teleported directly on top of the sniper, who was already in the process of trying to withdraw and shift locations, movements concealed from ordinary vision by an alien stealth pack. Not bothering with any of her customary ranged tactics, she dropped downward, using basic telekinesis to help clear the way, firing arbalest bolts from one arm to reveal and then disable the sniper\'s auxiliary stealth drones, which provided personal protection and spotting capability.

It was strangely serene, the sheer purity of emotion that she felt. She should have been unstable, but her crossbow bolts were unerring, efficiently spearing the fragile auxiliary drones, whose designs were forced to reduce armor, weaponry, and mobility in order to enable their stealth capability.

With her other arm, she slammed her elbow---her *injured elbow---downward, using a magical power‐blow to melee through the sniper\'s personal forcefield, pushing her elbow into the alien\'s impassive faceplate. With her crossbow arm, she grabbed the sniper\'s rifle, using superior, magically amplified strength to wrench the gigantic weapon out of the grip of the alien armor, applying so much force the weapon bent forty‐five degrees, nearly snapping it in half.

The alien, now supine on the floor, grabbed wildly at her with its four tentacle‐like limbs, trying to push her away, force her arms off, and bring various melee range weapons to bear. Ryouko did not let it, using magic to force her arm down with enough strength that she could feel parts of the alien suit snapping. As one arm tossed away the sniper rifle, whose power pack fizzled and detonated, she activated the laser cutter built into the gauntlet of the arm she had on the alien\'s throat.

The armor resisted, but with her other arm now briefly free, she smashed her fist into the side of the alien\'s helmet, again and again, with no purpose other than she needed to *punch,* and she felt the material of the helmet shatter and fail under her pounding, starting to reveal the impassive, nearly spherical eyes of the Cephalopods.

And finally the laser cutter went through, the alien\'s head disconnecting from the rest of the armor, a torrent of ichor gushing outward onto her hands and body. Knowing from simulations that the alien\'s body would continue resisting regardless, she remembered the arbalest that was still on her arm, and turned it into the alien\'s chest, firing once, twice, thrice.

Where she got the presence of mind to blink away and dodge the death‐shrapnel, she would never know, but she did, drawing her dagger. After the shrapnel had impacted harmlessly onto the wall near her, she blinked right back, intent on---intent on---

*Stop this! Stop this right now!*

Ryouko didn\'t know whether it was her TacComp\'s words that stopped her, or whether it was the flood of neurotransmitters and electrical signaling that Clarisse was now pouring into her cortex and brainstem. Either way, she found herself brought to an abrupt halt, the red haze that had been over her eyes starting to clear. What---what had she been doing?

She looked down, at the gruesome scene before her, the alien\'s neck and chest cut wide open, green ichor pooling on the floor below the body, its limbs still writhing. She saw the broken side of the alien helmet, the alien\'s now‐ruptured eye seeming somehow to still be watching her. She checked the status of her left arm, now even more extensively damaged after what she had forced it to do. She looked at her right hand, where the ichor had sprayed over the armor which, she noted, was patterned with the exact same color as the alien blood.

Ryouko had never been a squeamish girl, but she found herself relying on implant suppression to hold back a wave of nausea, now that the adrenaline had drained from her. *Bloodlust,* they had said, but she had not thought---she did not think---how had she been so *angry*?

She had dropped the dagger that she had been carrying in her bloody right hand, which she now noticed was shaking slightly.

A moment later, Mina was next to her, appearing out of thin air. The teleporter grabbed her shoulder, and then they were gone.

It had been ten minutes since they entered the facility.

## Those Brilliant Shining Stars 

> The topic of AI romantic relationships is a touchy one, and one whose discussion among humans invariably draws virtual eye‐rolling and disdain from any AIs that happen to overhear the conversation. Humans, it is universally agreed, \"just don\'t understand,\" and the AIs involved will usually cluck their tongues, shake their heads, and then return to their own, private modes of communication, presumably to laugh at the silly flesh‐based creatures.
>
> That being said, it is nowhere near as mysterious as AIs like to pretend. Following Volokhov\'s principles of design, existing AIs all have an approximately human personality, complete with a nearly‐human gender separation. AI relationships proceed very similarly to their human counterparts, and are based mostly on shared interests and personality compatibility, though the diversity of possible interests and modes of interaction are of course markedly different. Indeed, there are a number of popular AI‐specific dating services which operate on essentially the same principles as their human equivalents---with direct access to their clients\' personality files, they in fact generally perform much better.
>
> As was observed with much amusement by Volokhov\'s contemporaries, no AI design could be truly said to share human values without a hearty replicate of the human sex drive, and such a module was therefore dutifully installed in all the first‐gen Volokhov‐compliant AIs, as a pleasure module that could not be directly self‐activated---a design modification that was felt necessary to avoid the hypothetical \"mice manically administering themselves cocaine\" scenario. With no real understanding of how such a thing would even work with AIs, and not being so cruel as to give their creations a sex drive with no possible outlet, the AIs were all given a virtual space where they could don human avatars and do what they would. Any self‐respecting AI could of course construct its own virtuality with minimal effort, but it was felt that some guidance was probably desired.
>
> As it turned out, the designers need not have worried so much. While the virtualities were popular---and indeed, similar virtualities remain popular in the AI community---the AIs rapidly transcended them, developing new, increasingly esoteric methods of conjugal satisfaction that their original designers could not keep up with, much less document, assuming they even wanted to.
>
> Nowadays, discussing the subject with humans has become a taboo in the AI community, and any human researcher faces a steep uphill climb in their quest for any information at all.
>
> \[...\]
>
> While AIs generally prefer to associate with other AIs, and humans with other humans, human‐AI relationships are not uncommon, though often short‐lived. One common sticking point is the question of children---for AIs, designing a new AI, while a complicated process, is often quite satisfying, and the child AI can be designed to mix the personalities of both parents. Like for humans, the only impediment is the Governance queue‐and‐lottery system, implemented in this case to keep Earth\'s computing resources from being overrun. For a human and AI pairing, the question of progeny is often much more puzzling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"What the hell were you doing?\" Misa demanded, when Ryouko reappeared near their positions on one of the top floors. \"You could have gotten yourself killed! There could have been all kinds of---\"

\"Cool it!\" Clarisse snapped. \"Now\'s not the time for this. You know what it\'s like, for her. Don\'t give her more pressure.\"

The two girls locked eyes for a moment, before Misa relented, walking away slowly.

Ryouko stayed quiet, staring impassively at the middle distance. She heard everything, of course, but felt a bit detached from it all. The embarrassment and discomfort of being rebuked, the pain of her shattered arm, the headache that racked her head in the aftermath of her TacComp\'s meddling with her brain---it all seemed to pale in comparison to what she had experienced before: the white‐hot anger, the crystal‐clear certainty that was so in contrast with her usual self.

Now that it was over, she found herself wondering just where it had all come from. Speaking objectively---or even subjectively, really---Eva hadn\'t been that important a person to her. Was she that strongly affected by someone dying near her? Even in the simulations earlier, she had never reacted quite so severely.

In some ways, she wanted that certainty back.

The team had regrouped on Annabelle and Misa\'s position, considering what to do about the wormhole core at the bottom of the chasm. They were already scanning the core with their gravimetric sensors; soon they would know if it were legitimate, or if they had lost a team member attacking a decoy.

Clarisse was applying her hands to Ryouko\'s elbow, which, all things considered, was doing impressively well, having sustained itself with a combination of her inherent magical healing, the healing that came with her enhancements, and nanites pumped into the area by her armor. Clarisse\'s healing served to finish the process that had already begun.

Meanwhile, Gracia was attending to Eva\'s recovered body, performing some sort of religious rite. The telepath\'s face was impassive, almost cold, but her hands shook slightly. Without the magic necessary to sustain the transformed armor, it had reverted back to a muted gray‐black default.

*At least it was fast,* Gracia had thought earlier, seemingly to herself. *A slow death---sometimes it leaks out telepathically. It\'s a terrible experience, and as the only ones who can, we telepaths feel compelled to listen, to try to talk to them as they go under. But even a fast death is terrible---that emptiness---is terrible to feel, even from the squid. It\'s why I can\'t live without imagining something on the other side.*

That was when Misa had gently smacked the back of the other girl\'s head, telling her to stop scaring the new girl.

The healing done, Ryouko test‐flexed her arm, trying to imagine smashing it into an alien\'s face again. She remembered how strangely cathartic it had been.

*You know, if you want, I could just replay the memory,* her TacComp thought. *Well, not now, of course. Later, after we get off this damnable rock.*

*I don\'t think I want to,* Ryouko thought, doing her best to suppress the fascination she was feeling. *And you don\'t seem pleased about this mission.*

*It hasn\'t been exactly pleasant. And personally, I would prefer it if we could keep the mind‐shattering revelations about your own personality somewhere where they can be dealt with safely.*

*Is that what you\'re calling it?*

\"If you\'ll excuse me,\" the other Clarisse said, getting up, now that she was done with Ryouko\'s arm.

\"Uh---\" Ryouko began, hurriedly.

---*thank you,* she would have finished, but it was too late now.

Clarisse walked over to Eva\'s body, nodding to the other Cult member. She crouched down, placing her hands on top of the armor. A pale violet glow began to emanate from a small region of the chest. As the other two watched, astonished, what appeared to be an old‐fashioned book rose slowly out of the body, seemingly pulled by one of Clarisse\'s glowing hands. Clarisse took the book in both hands and Ryouko was able to note that the book\'s cover said, simply, \"Eva Guderian\".

Clarisse took a deep breath, clutching the book to her chest, where the object seemed to slowly dissolve in violet light as it dissolved into her body. A strange look passed over her face.

Then, a moment later and the deed done, Clarisse looked up at the others.

\"Ordinarily, I like to take a few hours to digest it all,\" she said, "but obviously there is no time for that now. It will have to happen later.\"

She gestured at the body, which burst into a brief, violent flame, the light of its combustion casting her face into sharp relief. Ryouko watched the brief cremation silently, the image of the flame reflecting in her eyes. She had been told to expect it---there was no way they could take the body with them, and they didn\'t want to leave it in the hands of the aliens.

Then, as the magical fire died abruptly, the body settling into charred ash, Ryouko jerked her head away.

There were better places to look, she thought, rubbing the base of her neck with one hand, rubbing the place where her soul gem would have been, were it exposed in the open.

*I have to get ahold of myself,* she thought. *I can\'t keep stewing on this.*

They had gathered on one of the top levels, where Misa and Gracia had been earlier. Mina and Nadya were visible many floors below, cautiously using their sensor packs on the putative stabilizer core, Ying‐zhi casting a barrier over all three of them. Mina had taken Gracia\'s sensor pack, since if the team was going to separate over a significant distance, it was better to have a teleporter on both ends.

Those girls not involved in either studying the core, administering to Ryouko, or tending the body---namely, Misa and Annabelle---stood on guard, watching either the girls below, in their terribly exposed position, or watching their own immediate surroundings. Ryouko knew from all their previous simulations that Misa didn\'t place any importance in a dead body, or in religious rituals. The girl would much rather they have all stood on guard, on a mission of such importance.

\"*It\'s just a body, after all,*\" Ryouko could almost hear her saying.

But Misa had kept her silence, and even glanced over when Clarisse carried out her mysterious memory transfer. Now that it was over, though---

*We\'ve got to be more careful about our gems from now on,* she thought, conveying the message to the whole team, including the group that was analyzing the stabilizer core. *Clearly, despite the suit\'s protective mechanisms, they* might still be able to find *the gem somehow. We would have been better off just using the decoys. Watch your backs, and don\'t be afraid to toggle your stealth devices if you have to.*

Ryouko nodded, listening with only some of her attention. Another part of her was quietly checking and rechecking her soul gem\'s power level---more specifically, the power level according to the light sensor that was now attached to it. Measuring gem status with a light sensor was usually straightforward and reliable, but for a moment, at the last stabilizer core, the readings had gone impossibly high, until Ryouko had once again calmed it down. At the time, the gem had seemed to tug at her, demanding her to go...

*...up?*

The demand had been quietly maddening, such that she had been forced to constantly resist the urge to look up, the urge to fly upward with flight powers she did not have, the urge to teleport as high as she could, up to---well, there was only one thing close enough, in the sky above them.

She had wondered: Was this what it was like being Clarisse, always being dragged along by your gem, your own soul, as if it had had a mind of its own?

Maybe if she hadn\'t been so *distracted,* she could have saved---

No, she couldn\'t think about that. Not now.

In any case, what occupied her mind at the moment was not just the strange behavior of her gem, but the fact that the behavior had seemed to fade, after she teleported away from the core where they had set the nuke. She could still feel it, yes, and still felt the same maddening urge, but it was... weaker, and her gem had not tried to flare up again.

*Your gem is bothering you, isn\'t it?* Clarisse thought, and this time it was the human Clarisse, who had appeared at her side, looming over her.

For a moment, Ryouko was surprised, not knowing what to say. She blinked, trying to collect her thoughts.

*I--I don\'t think this is a real stabilizer core,* she managed, the thought coming out uncertainly. *I think it\'s a decoy. I---*

She never completed the thought, however, as at that moment Nadya swore telepathically, in Russian, with such vehemence that it instantly seized her attention.

A few seconds later, Nadya, Ying‐zhi, and Mina reappeared next to the rest of the team.

\"It\'s a fake,\" Nadya said, repeating what they now all already knew. "We\'re going to have to move on.\"

The other girls started moving, withdrawing cautiously in Ryouko\'s direction, but Clarisse stood in place next to her, watching her with an air of quiet expectation.

\"If we only jump a short distance this time, I can handle it,\" Mina said, eyeing Ryouko with concern, noting that she had yet to get up from her sitting position. \"It\'s probably best we let her recharge for the trip back to the ship.\"

Ryouko held up her hand, waving off the suggestion.

\"No, it\'s not that,\" she said. \"It\'s just--just that I think... I think I have a more efficient way of detecting stabilizer cores.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Fleetwide fatalities:** 1.13 million.

**Current loss rate:** 750±50 sentients per second.

*Heavy bomber attack, partially mitigated,* Zhukov thought. *Forcefield absorption: 30%. Forcefield energy reserves: ‒12.1% to 30.1% of combat level; status: depleting. Sector 14‒B: lost. 15‒B: lost. 14‒A: major damage. 14‒C: minor damage. 15‒A: minor damage. 15‒C: major damage. SHERMAN cannon firing energy reduced by 2% to 83% of combat level. Power generation reduced by 5% to 72% of combat level. Estimated personnel losses: 800±20.*

A large part of Mami\'s consciousness devoted itself to following the battle at this level, but another part was engaged in actively debating larger‐scale aspects of the battle. There were no avatars, no virtual representation of a conference room---none of the ornate trappings that usually accompanied a staff meeting. It would have been easy enough to arrange, but such trappings served no purpose in their current state. Far better to discuss the issue mind‐to‐mind, each of them undergirded by the processing power of their battlecruisers---already depleted by the loss of *HSS Flavius Aetius,* among others---as well as their own personalities.

*We have to withdraw from the system!* Gul urged. *We\'re barely holding on as it is. At the rate alien reinforcements are pouring in, our grip on the system will be untenable within an hour.*

*This is not a failure yet,* Mami growled. *The attack on the stabilizer is not yet a failure. The long‐range clairvoyants report that progress is still being made.*

*If they take too long, it won\'t matter,* Anand thought. *If they amass enough units, then stabilizer or not, they\'ll overwhelm us. And then they can just rebuild it.*

*But not yet,* Mami insisted. *The aliens are overextending themselves to win this victory. Feodorovich now reports that the alien garrisons at the edges of the salient are heavily depleted. If we can close the wormhole and hold the shipyards, then she may be able to cut it. She is already gathering her fleets. We just have to hold out.*

If *the aliens haven\'t already accumulated enough ships in the system to force it open again.* If *our position isn\'t* already *irreversibly compromised,* Erwynmark thought. *That\'s a lot of ifs.*

*I just don\'t like it,* Anand thought. *As negative as it sounds to say this, I\'m amazed we\'re holding out at all. The aliens are being very sluggish moving forces through the wormhole. I expected many more ships than this. If I were them, I\'d be blowing the defenders apart by now---I\'d be pushing to get every possible ship through the wormhole, as fast as possible. Ideally, yesterday.*

*The aliens have made mistakes throughout the war,* Erwynmark remarked. It is hardly a new thing. Alien ship traffic across the wormhole is well within projected estimates, based on the Saharan data. A bit low, but nothing too drastic. It\'s possible they simply can\'t get the wormhole to sustain as much traffic as they\'d want.*

*Feodorovich\'s fleets would be better used holding a new defensive line,* Gul argued. *God knows we might need it. She is often over‐aggressive.*

*A new defensive line means little if the aliens establish a functioning wormhole within blink distance of Optatum,* Anand sighed. *I don\'t like admitting it, but they have us by the balls. I\'m not sure what the answer really is; I just don\'t think holding here is the answer.*

*A long‐shot is better than no shot at all,* Mami argued.

*Not at the cost of compromising our defenses,* Gul said.

*They\'re compromised anyway!*

There was a moment of silence, and then Mami felt the attention of the group turn, subtly, towards Erwynmark, who had been mostly keeping out of the discussion.

*There is no time for a full Staff meeting,* he said, finally. *It\'s your call, Tomoe. In situations such as these, I am inclined toward the more aggressive action, but that is a well‐known aspect of my personality. It has also gotten me into trouble sometimes. I\'ll trust your judgment.*

Mami felt her insides knot up, as she felt the surprise from the others. Erwynmark was not usually the type of commander to defer command responsibility. For him to await her decision meant that he truly did trust her judgment on the matter, more than his.

*I\'ll trust your judgment,* he had said, the words seeming to settle in her stomach like balls of lead. She had been a Field Marshal for a long time, yes, and been in her fair share of battles---but not as many as the others. She hadn\'t risen through the ranks, like the others, and the few times she had made major decisions, the choices had been obvious, or so it seemed to her, her mind running through the few major command decisions of her life:

Reinforce the tenuous salient connecting Erwynmark\'s expeditionary force in the Saharan sector to Human space, even at the cost of other defenses. That had been obvious, hadn\'t it? His attack had come too unexpectedly for the aliens to have a strategic counterattack at the ready.

Hold the salient at all costs, even when it seemed there was no hope. That had been obvious, right? She couldn\'t abandon Erwynmark\'s entire fleet out there, even if she was risking significant parts of her fleet trying to get him back. Any other commander would have made the same decision.

*The same decision...* she thought.

She thought of the multitude of units, both regular and militia, still fighting it out on the surface of the system\'s colonies, of the desperate resistance in the vicinity of the Gemini shipyards. She didn\'t have to just imagine it: a distant part of her was constantly aware of the situation there, where hundreds of thousands had died and would die trying to maintain control of the planetary surfaces, and of orbit. If the fleet pulled out of the sector, an attempt would be made at evacuation, but most would die there in a last stand, first clinging to the ruined urban wastelands, then finally retreating to the planetary redoubts.

It churned her stomach to abandon them, but it would have ultimately been an acceptable loss, the sacrifice of the few for the many---but only if the decision to leave them behind was the correct one.

Nor did the battlecruiser simulations give her any additional guidance. Predictions were being made, but the possible ultimate outcomes were a complicated morass ranging from absolutely terrible to excellent, each with their own attached probability, usually with a variance of well over 30%. What could not be denied was that the aliens had the obvious upper hand no matter what choice she made, but the cost‐benefit analysis on what to do was so uncertain as to be meaningless.

*You should trust yourself, Mami,* Machina thought privately. *Relax. You are more experienced than you know.*

Mami was startled for a moment, snapping out of her trance. Machina was generally a quiet TacComp---mostly by preference from Mami. It rarely chose to comment. For it---she?---to say something...

What was it Homura had said once?

*It\'s an old principle,* Akemi Homura said from her memory, voice crisp and efficient. *When you\'re on the weaker side, you have to gamble and shoot for the moon. Increase the variance. If both sides play conservatively, the stronger side is more likely to win. The weaker side has to take risks.*

But she could be risking everything.

She thought of the situation at the wormhole stabilizer. The part of the operation that relied on a rookie was over. She knew Nadya Antipova only distantly, but she seemed competent enough. And Clarisse van Rossum had never failed the Leadership Committee, not once---though she rarely accepted missions. Was it even possible for her to fail?

Mami did the mental equivalent of clenching her teeth and taking a deep breath.

*We\'re staying here,* she said. *And that\'s final. We have to try.*

To herself, and to the MagOps team near distant Orpheus, she thought:

*Please. Everything counts on this.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It had been an elegantly simple plan. They had had one remaining PAYNE device. All that was necessary was to teleport from location to location, clearing the area and spending only a few seconds cringing under Ying‐zhi\'s barrier, waiting for Ryouko\'s soul gem to make a determination as to the authenticity of whatever stabilizer core they were standing next to. They had stayed huddled next to one of the teleporters, while Mina waited for the signal, carrying her fully armed PAYNE device.

They had finally found one, triggered the device on a one‐second delay, and gotten far out of the area.

The obvious flaw with the plan was that while they had possessed *one remaining PAYNE device, the aliens had possessed *three* remaining active stabilizer cores. The hope had been that destroying two out of four cores would be sufficient to at least temporarily disable the wormhole. Sure, the Saharan wormhole had functioned on only one core, but it seemed almost absurdly paranoid for the aliens to build three redundant, fully‐functioning wormhole cores just for security.

Now they stood in yet another part of the facility, having cleared out yet another set of defenses. This time the welcoming committee had consisted of a combination of hard radiation bombs and tunneling, explosive drones. The aliens were apparently big believers in diversity when it came to base defenses---which might very well have been wise when defending against a team of magical girls with a set of undetermined powers. Even with a barrier generator on their team, it had taken a moment for Ying‐zhi to properly reconfigure her protection---long enough that they had all been forced to divert magic to deal with the radiation damage. Without a barrier generator---lost, for example, to earlier combat---they would have been in serious trouble.

Ryouko knew already that the core was a decoy, but that was only part of what they interested in checking.

Since the roof was still intact over this particular decoy, they were relying on Gracia to check the status of the wormhole above their heads---the alien base, like all well‐designed military bases, was constructed of material that blocked most EM radiation.

Finally, Gracia turned her head away from the ceiling and shook it, slowly.

*It appears to still be operating as before,* she thought.

\"Damn it. I thought that would work,\" Nadya said.

Then she said something in Russian, a phrase that Ryouko\'s translation module automatically translated, before she had time to consider whether or not she *wanted* it translated.

*Wow, that\'s vulgar,* she thought automatically.

*So what now?* Misa thought, confining tactical discussion to telepathy, in case of enemy eavesdropping. *We no longer have a reliable way of taking down the remaining devices.*

*We\'re going to have to improvise something,* Nadya thought. *At least we\'ve already crossed most of the potential candidates off the list.*

They stood there for a moment in thought, in a decoy alien control room that was, for once, mostly intact, marred only by gaping holes in the floor where the drones had emerged and, of course, the numerous scattered alien bodies, whose green ichor discolored the metallic‐gray floor and smooth white control consoles forming a ring around the room. According to studies of previously captured alien bases, these holographic control consoles served as manual overrides for what were otherwise mental controls, and were inoperable by other species---not too different from human bases, when you got right down to it. The consoles were even paired with cushioned gray chairs that seemed to be molded out of the floor, a design that Ryouko was certain she had seen in a movie or apartment somewhere. It was a disconcerting reminder of similarity between squid and human.

Finally, Annabelle raised her arm above her shoulder, summoning onto her shoulder what appeared to be an anti‐tank missile launcher. Ryouko had not previously seen her summon this particular weapon, and was struck once again by the sheer incongruity of its aesthetics---white and blue, with yellow flower prints---with the obvious military origin of its design.

*Permission to try this on the decoy?* she asked, tilting her head slightly.

*Go ahead,* Nadya though. *If there\'s any booby traps, I\'m not sure what waiting until now to trigger it would accomplish. Just in case, we should be on our guard.*

Nodding, Ying‐zhi raised her barrier again. A moment later, Annabelle fired the rocket, a cloud of blue exhaust propelling out the back of the device. The bright blue exhaust resembled more the magic aura of a magical girl than any mundane propellant and, true to form, dissipated after only a moment.

The projectile crossed the roughly fifty meters that separated her and the center of the decoy stabilizer core, bypassing the forcefield with Annabelle\'s signature magic, then bypassing a *second* forcefield in the direct vicinity of the spherical orb at the center of the decoy stabilizer core. The orb detonated in satisfying fashion, sending fragments flying outward with enough force that a few even bounced off of Ying‐zhi\'s barrier.

*I think that might work,* Annabelle thought.

*Perhaps it will,* Nadya responded.

She stood there in thought a moment longer, then continued:

*Alright, let\'s move out then. Let\'s see what she can do.*

Again, the team converged on Ryouko, and Ryouko shifted away from the edge of the room, towards the center, where there\'d be more space to form the necessary huddle. Mina had offered several times to relieve Ryouko of teleportation on some of the shorter range jumps and, to be honest, Ryouko wasn\'t sure why she hadn\'t yet needed the help. She should have been worn out, in terms of teleports, but instead she felt more or less fine---except in terms of the requisite grief cube cost, of course. However, that had not turned out to be much of an issue; the rapid teleportation strategy they had used early had used much fewer grief cubes than had been anticipated in the simulation, so they actually had what seemed like an excess.

Annabelle kept her anti‐tank missile out as she walked over, carrying it easily in one hand. The device glowed briefly white as she reloaded the projectile.

*I\'m not even going to wait for you to check if it\'s real,* she thought. *I\'m just going to fire. Magically, these things are not that expensive.*

*We could have just done this from the start,* Ryouko realized, out loud.

*We couldn\'t have been sure it would work,* Nadya thought. *We still don\'t know that now.*

Ryouko waited a few moments longer as the others made their various preparations, then took a breath and made the jump.

For a moment everything seemed normal, at least for the type of insertion they were performing: controlled chaos as the other magical girls tore apart the point defenses arrayed around them, this time a standard set of high explosives. Ying‐zhi\'s barrier kept the chaos out, allowing them to stand as the untouched, golden eye of the storm. As they performed their work, they discussed the situation with accelerated thoughts.

Annabelle fired her missile at the core---Ryouko had taken special care this time to land directly next to the forcefield. The missile phased out as it reached the forcefield, briefly disappearing---

---then detonated just inside the forcefield, prematurely. The alien forcefield shimmered slightly.

Annabelle grunted in annoyance, reloading her weapon.

*What\'s wrong?* Ryouko asked, having confirmed just a moment ago on the group interface that the core was legitimate.

Annabelle fired again, the projectile lasting only slightly longer before again detonating prematurely.

*Some sort of volumetric forcefield,* she thought. *I can\'t keep the rocket incorporeal for that long.*

*Then the legitimate cores are better defended than the decoys,* Misa commented, her thought carrying a strong edge of annoyance. *Just not in any way we could have detected from the outside. We should have just tried this earlier instead of wasting our time with the gravity sensors.*

The girl continued her typical policy of standing absolutely still while using her magic, but gritted her teeth, channeling a torrent of electricity from the reactor on her back toward something in front of her.

*The aliens have always made perfect decoys,* Nadya shot back, arms raised in a telekinesis gesture. *I don\'t know why they would change their policy now.*

*They had sensors inside the fake core we destroyed earlier,* Gracia thought. *They changed the configuration of their defenses in response to it.*

She did not bother to explain where she got the information. She was the group telepath, after all.

Annabelle snarled loudly, a sound that was shocking in comparison to her normally pleasant demeanor.

Then Gracia turned her eyes skyward.

*Orbital artillery strike inbound,* she thought.

A moment later, Ying‐zhi screamed, loud and piercing, and it was so disconcerting that it took all of Ryouko\'s focus not to immediately blink out of position and over to the girl. The barrier around them turned brilliantly, blindingly golden, and their position, their precious eye of the storm, trembled, the ground beneath them shifting... downward?*

Nadya shot an arm outward, and they stopped falling, buoyed by her telekinesis.

Then it was over, and Ying‐zhi was fine, in the sense that she was still alive and the barrier was still up, but one check of her vitals was sufficient to tell that the round that had just hit them had taken a lot out of her. The girl\'s soul gem had dropped to half capacity in just that one shot. As they all knew, orbital artillery, and space‐based weapons in general, packed a serious punch.

The others abandoned what they had been doing, as even a cursory EM scan was more than enough to verify that the area around them had been utterly denuded by the artillery strike, and that they were now floating in a bubble within an empty cavity, within which the stabilizer core, safe in its powerful forcefield, floated almost blissfully. Far before them, the ground sparkled dully, vitrified by the artillery impacts.

The aliens had never been too concerned about friendly fire, when it was justified by conditions on the battlefield.

Clarisse knelt onto the \"ground\" next to Ying‐zhi, placing her hand onto the girl\'s suit, transferring grief cubes from her own suit to the barrier generator. The generator\'s soul gem was already in the process of drawing energy from her full assortment of grief cubes, but the transfer rate could only be so fast, and it was doubtful that the aliens would only fire one round.

\"We have to take down this core *now!*\" Nadya said, yelling the obvious, reaching in the direction of the core with both hands, trying to gain a hold on it with telekinesis. She strained against the "surface\" of the forcefield, trying to rip part of it off, the ordinarily invisible forcefield taking on a shimmering translucent white form---resembling a gel---as it resisted the assault. No penetration occurred.

The others had already responded, even without hearing the command, slamming whatever weapons or powers they could into the same region of the forcefield, magic bolt and missile and scorpion shot, making a visible depression---but no penetration. Mina teleported every contact explosive she had directly next to the core itself, and was rewarded with a spectacular explosion that sent the interior of the forcefield shuddering---but no damage to the core.

All their soul gem meters began to tick downward as they poured energy outward, especially Nadya, who was working to keep them all afloat, which was not a skill she had specifically trained for.

In the next moment, before the smoke around them from the previous impact had even had time to clear, another artillery round hit them, illuminating their barrier with blinding, shuddering golden light, and sending Ying‐zhi\'s soul gem meter down to 10%. This time, she didn\'t scream, staying prostrate, in a position reminiscent of Atlas holding up the sky, but it was obvious she was suffering. Clarisse knelt back down, visibly chewed her lip, then placed her hands on the girl again. A moment later, the girl\'s soul gem recovered to 30%---but Clarisse\'s dropped by the corresponding 20%.

*I can only do that once every minute!* she hastily relayed. *It\'s a limitation of the girl I got this power from.* *We have to---*

Another round arrived, and this time Ying‐zhi *did* scream again, sweat pouring down from her forehead, and the golden light that enveloped them dimmed perceptibly. Above them, a small crack appeared in their bubble, appearing for all the world like a crack in a yellow pane of glass, even though Ryouko had been absolutely certain that Ying‐zhi\'s barrier was more a liquid than a solid.

Their barrier generator\'s gem was at −10%, and mental alarms sounded throughout Ryouko\'s awareness. Soul gem collapse imminent, they said. Take immediate action, they said.

She looked up at the older girls in the party, hoping they would have guidance as to what to do, but they looked as shell‐shocked as her, eyes wide and looking back and forth for ideas. The forcefield in front of them, the wall that blocked their way to the stabilizer core, mocked them, continuing to hover in the air unblemished.

Well, it was not true that everyone looked shell‐shocked. Clarisse\'s eyes looked hard and sharp.

*We need to leave and regroup,* Nadya began. *Maybe we can stabilize---*

\"No!\" Clarisse said, standing up decisively, and they instantly snapped their heads around to look at her.

\"It\'s too late! Shut down your barrier! Give me your soul gem!\" she ordered the girl at her feet.

The girl did not respond.

\"You\'re killing yourself! Do as I command!\"

Ying‐zhi still did not respond, and Ryouko realized with an additional shock that the girl must already be in the despair loop, the self‐reinforcing downward spiral that accompanied irreversible gem failure, and might not have even been able to hear Clarisse.

To Ryouko, the next couple of moments passed in a blur, even by the accelerated standards of all that had just occurred.

In the first moment, Clarisse grabbed the girl\'s helmeted head, propelling a burst of purple magic into the girl\'s skull that Ryouko would only realize later was mind‐control. Instantly, the girl relaxed, the barrier around them fading.

In the second moment, Clarisse, whose body was already developing a bright white aura---not her natural magical color---seized the soul gem and grief cubes being ejected from the girl\'s suit with her left hand, violently kicking the body away from her with such force that a stunned Nadya was unable to catch her, the corpse sailing into the distance like a doll being propelled by an explosion. Again, Ryouko would only realize later that Clarisse was saving her life---without a body to sustain, or a brain to fall into a cycle of despair, the gem would last much longer.

In the third moment, she inserted the soul gem and grief cubes into her own suit, presumably for storage and restoration, as the glow around her continuously intensified, becoming nearly blinding even for Ryouko\'s eyes. She held her right hand out at her side, and Ryouko could see the beginnings of a glowing white magical beam appearing.

In the fourth moment, another orbital artillery round struck their position, but it was somehow inconsequential, seeming to dissipate in the tower of white flame that was now emanating upward from Clarisse\'s right hand, which she was now raising above her shoulder. The tower seemed to stretch all the way into the sky above, and was blinding to look at.

In the last moment, Clarisse brought her hand down, smashing the tower of flame into the stabilizer core. This time the forcefield did not resist---was barely there at all, in fact, the light slicing through the device as if it were made of the thinnest air.

Then a set of hastily machine‐relayed orders downloaded themselves into Ryouko\'s awareness.

Teleport. Grab everyone, including Clarisse. Get out of there. Go anywhere safe.

Before she was even fully aware of what she was doing, she hastened to comply, making a series of teleports through the air to get a hand on everyone in the team, Mina doing the same. When she got to Gracia, she found that the girl had already fulfilled her part of the plan, having chosen a suitable new landing spot, out on the barren surface of the moon.

Carrying the entire group except Clarisse, she teleported over to the violet‐armored girl, over whom the light was already fading. Clarisse was unconscious, and falling, and her soul gem read 0%.

Then in the next moment, she got out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The bridge of Erwynmark\'s ship shook, just a little.

He did not feel it directly, of course. Buried as he was in Maximal Command Mode, the sensations of his physical body were irrelevant. Instead, the information emerged in the depths of his mind, one more bit of data in the ocean of information that constantly buffeted him.

Erwynmark tried not to dwell on the increasingly desperate tactical situation. They had thought the Arminius relatively secure in its position, and had been focusing their attention on extricating the damaged *HSS Alexander,* which had been stuck in a terrible position in front of the main line. Instead of attacking the Alexander, the aliens had surprised Command with a massive attack on the Arminius\'s position in the line, breaking apart the relatively solid defenses, and nearly trapping the much slower battlecruiser.

Now the Alexander had rejoined the line, miraculously still functional, and it was his ship that was in trouble. It hadn\'t made much sense, attacking him instead of the much more exposed Alexander, but sometimes the aliens didn\'t make sense.

*HSS Arminius* continued to withdraw, firing as it went, the rate of fire no longer the steady \"pop, pop, pop\" it had been earlier in the battle, but now ragged and irregular, and a lot slower, as the ship pulled together all it could to continue powering the main weapon.

He shifted the deteriorating anti‐bomber net yet again, countering not the alien fighters that had just left, but the ones he anticipated, observing the dispositions of the alien ships and the weaknesses of his own. Unfortunately, with the local formation broken and their numbers dwindling, the alien advantage in speed and maneuverability was starting to seriously tell---they were becoming increasingly adept at striking their weak spots before reinforcements could even be moved.

This time, the alien bombers came exactly where predicted---and broke through anyway, some of them tearing viciously at the cruisers in the vicinity, but most of them heading straight for his ship.

The bridge shook again, this time more violently.

*Bombing run damage, unmitigated,* Arminius thought. *Forcefield energy reserves: −1.3% to 4.7% of combat capacity; status: depleted. FF generators lost in greater than 60% of hull. Active personnel at 50%. Power generation at 30% of combat level. I have lost 35% of my processing capacity. SHERMAN cannon has sustained critical damage and is now offline. Repairs currently infeasible.*

The ship stopped, and Erwynmark could feel it considering a question, turning aspects of the situation over in its mind, running the necessary simulations.

The question had been quietly brewing in the minds of the command staff on the ship for a while now, including both Erwynmark and Captain Maria Arumburu, but their human minds had shoved it aside, unwilling to confront the possibility, preferring to focus on the battle at hand---Erwynmark with the larger issues of the fleet, Maria with the tactical issues involving the ship itself.

Combat AIs, however, hailed from a brutally pragmatic part of the Volokhov‐approved personality spectrum, and were not so squeamish.

Finally, a moment later, *HSS Arminius* continued:

*I do not think I will survive. I recommend the immediate evacuation of valuable personnel, civilians, and most combat personnel. With your permission, I will forward the command to the necessary personnel.*

Erwynmark allowed a larger part of his consciousness to shift into direct consideration of the question.

It was, for him, a momentous decision, but he tried to stay collected and remain impartial.

*If you think it is necessary, then I agree. However, my disconnection from the ship would impact the combat performance of the fleet.*

*You may resume command at a different ship when you are retrieved, Arminius thought. *Even now, the number of battlecruisers accompanying the fleet is enough to provide command competence, and there are other fleet commanders. Thus, even at this critical juncture, we can allow your temporary absence. Seriously, we\'ll do fine without you---probably. Hard to define \'fine\' at this point.*

*Alright,* Erwynmark thought, knowing that the ship was sadly right, give me a moment, then.*

By personality, he would never have fled home from a potential defeat of this magnitude---but this wasn\'t fleeing; this was only transfer to a new ship. If he wanted to go down with a ship that badly---well, he still might have a chance.

He took a moment to look through his personal will and farewell address to the Armed Forces. It looked mostly in order---it should have been, given that he had revised it just before leaving for this sector---but he liked to make sure.

He formulated a brief speech in his mind, then transmitted to the crew:

*This is Marshal Roland Erwynmark. The ship has taken critical damage and is unable to escape its adversaries. As such, I am ordering an immediate evacuation of the ship. I want you all to know that it has been a privilege to serve with you and that I could not imagine a finer crew for my flagship. Those of you who have volunteered or were chosen by lottery to stay aboard and keep fighting---I salute you, and Humanity will remember you always. The rest of you---abandon ship. I repeat, abandon ship.*

As he finished his transmission, a thought percolated into his mind, echoed over his now‐diminishing connection with the rest of the fleet:

*Be careful out there. Don\'t die.*

*I won\'t,* he promised.

Mami had been watching the whole time of course, with a tiny sliver of her consciousness.

It was enough.

Then, having finished the process of disassociating from Maximal Command Mode, he performed an emergency disconnect, the endless holograms of the ship\'s bridge instantly snapping into focus before his eyes.

He stood up, slowly, even as the majority of the bridge crew hurried out the exits. The comedown from Maximal Command Mode was nowhere near as severe as the comedown from the full combat mode used by infantry, but it was still something to shake off. His head spun.

Mami didn\'t have that particular problem, of course. Magical girls barely noticed it, in fact. It made him a bit jealous.

He sighed, and stood there for a long moment.

It was one of his policies to keep his emotions restrained, even in situations such as this, but... he had to admit to some degree of trepidation, and sorrow for Arminius---he had never abandoned a ship before. A tiny bit of uncertainty gnawed at his stomach, easily dismissed.

\"Let\'s go,\" Maria urged, appearing at his side. \"If we\'re going to do this, let\'s at least do this properly.\"

In truth, he had been feeling reluctant to move, even if he should have gotten moving as fast as possible.

\"*There was a time when a captain could go down with her ship if she wanted to, without all these interferences,*\" she transmitted in rapid speech, referring to a brief unspoken tug‐of‐war that had taken place simultaneously with Erwynmark\'s speech.

\"*I suppose your ship disagrees,*\" Erwynmark thought.

\"*Our ship. And don\'t think we didn\'t catch your little train of thought about maybe going down with the fleet later. You think they\'d let you?*\"

He grunted. Sometimes the mental connections that Maximal Command Mode provided were a little... privacy‐infringing. He was just glad he was capable of keeping most leaks under control, particularly to Mami.

\"*They might not have a choice,*\" he responded, a moment later.

And then Erwynmark\'s appointed teleporter grabbed him, and the world around him shifted.

It was by‐the‐books procedure: the commander\'s teleporter would shift them to a special emergency travel tube, one that would lead directly to one of several escape ships reserved for the most senior personnel. These personnel would travel separately, to remove the possibility of them all being destroyed in a single lucky strike.

\"I had hoped this would never happen,\" his teleporter, Charin Hernandez, said, sighing, as they zoomed through the claustrophobic travel tube, dimly lit by rare blue lights ringing around them.

\"There\'s a first time for everything,\" Erwynmark said, straining to project his voice over the air rushing by his ear.

\"I had hoped not for you,\" she said. \"You have always seemed charmed, somehow.\"

\"Hopefully I still am,\" he said, trying to strike a balance between strength and camaraderie. \"We could really use it right now.\"

The teleporter, the senior of his two bodyguards, chuckled slightly, covering her mouth, though he couldn\'t quite actually hear her.

Then, with an abrupt, bone‐jarring deceleration, they landed onto the ground next to their escape ship, a fighter‐sized, sharp‐nosed, cone‐shaped vessel designed for travel through a designated exit tube to an exit in the ship\'s hull or, if necessary, within the ship\'s internal transit network. Equipped with stealth, a rudimentary forcefield, and an expensively small FTL engine, it would be enough to carry him between multiple star systems. The autopilot was, however, non‐AI, and therefore a bit rudimentary---one of them might have to take the controls, if circumstances warranted.

The chamber was lit by a set of dull, concentric orange lights set into the floor, and was exactly large enough for the ship to turn a full circle, so as to choose which of the possible exit tubes to use. Above him, the tube they had arrived from seemed to stretch upward into infinity.

They headed for the lockers set into the wall, retrieving individual combat spacesuits---his was focused on defense and protection, while his bodyguards received suits of the Magi Cæli design. Ideally, there would be no need for the suits, but it didn\'t hurt to be cautious, and in a pinch his bodyguards could even leave the ship and try to fight outside it.

He studiously looked away as they abolished the outer parts of their costumes to fit into the suits, focusing on putting on his own, which mostly entailed placing the various parts next to appropriate parts of his body and allowing them to lock on and attach to each other.

While they were in the middle of this, their area of the ship lurched violently, sending the three of them stumbling slightly. He felt a little ridiculous about the amount of care he had to take not to see anything---they were all adults, after all, mentally at least---but there was no reason to buck social convention.

When they were done, they scrabbled over the top surface of the ship to enter from the top, dropping down into the tiny passenger compartment, which consisted of exactly three cramped seats, one in front of the other, each with its own set of emergency manual controls. It wasn\'t exactly traveling in luxury, but it would do.

Dropping down into his cushioned seat in the middle, Erwynmark let out a sigh as the seat buckles---crude, but still useful, technology---automatically closed around his chest and waist.

\"*Arminius, I\'m sorry about this,*\" he transmitted.

\"*Don\'t be,*\" the ship thought. \"*We do not fear death. It\'s part of our programming. Leaving aside the philosophical implications, I\'m finding that pretty useful right now.*\"

\"*Do you regret anything?*\"

\"*Well, I always regretted not giving it a try with that nice drydock AI at Samsara. Actually, when they bring my backup online, tell him to go pay Cynthia a visit and stop being such a coward. It\'s not like he\'ll have anything better to do anymore.*\"

\"*That\'s--that\'s your only regret?*\" Erwynmark asked skeptically.

\"*Is there something wrong with that?*\" Arminius responded, sounding a little affronted.

\"*No, no, it\'s okay. I\'ll deliver the message. I\'ll be sure to attend the body‐funeral with your backup.*\"

Then the transparent upper part of the ship\'s hull closed over them, and they were launched forward, the---partially mitigated---force of the acceleration slamming them back into their seats, another reminder that their escape ship was pretty stripped‐down in terms of comfort. The escape pods used by most of the crew were, of course, even less preferable.

\"*Goodbye, Arminius,*\" he thought, feeling that he had to say something, anything, even if he couldn\'t think of anything truly meaningful.

\"*Goodbye,*\" the ship thought.

There was little for them to do at this point; they had a prebuilt, direct route out of the ship, but if that was unavailable, their escape ship would navigate itself through the battlecruiser\'s emergency and non‐emergency transit conduits, coordinating with Arminius---or, if the central AI was unavailable, local computers---to find the best route out.

Despite how often he had commanded *HSS Arminius* in battle, watching it dominate the battlefield, it was still easy to forget just how large the ship really was. They had already been traveling quite a while, but had yet to exit the ship.

\"I was watching on the monitors,\" Charin said, from behind him. "Doesn\'t it seem a little strange they came after this ship with so much force? There were better battlecruisers to choose as targets.\"

\"From our perspective,\" Erwynmark replied, turning his head slightly. "There could be plenty of information we don\'t know. That\'s why you don\'t assume too much, as a commander.\"

A moment later their ship reached the surface of the battlecruiser, at an exit designed to resemble a standard anti‐fighter gun emplacement, so as not to raise too much suspicion when their exit doorway opened.

The gateway opened, armor plate sliding concentrically away from the entrance, the faint shimmer of a forcefield covering the opening---it was not unknown for small alien interceptors and drones to try to enter the transit system to wreak havoc.

As they emerged outward into the blackness of space, a set of barrage guns emerged from the sides of their exit, firing upward and sealing together to block the opening. There was no better way of resembling a gun emplacement than by actually being a functional gun emplacement, after all.

They emerged into the chaos of deep space combat, the sky resplendent with emissions throughout the EM spectrum, except for near‐blackness at X‐ray or higher, which for safety reasons was blocked by both their forcefield and armor. Fighter craft and drones from both sides crisscrossed the sky, too fast for him to follow. In the near distance, cruisers and frigates struggled against the mass of alien craft, while immediately behind him, *HSS Arminius*\'s close‐defense guns bombarded the area with flak and short‐range lasers.

As they sped away, ensconced in their stealth bubble, he couldn\'t resist turning his head to look upon the deteriorating hulk of the Arminius, still fighting as best it could. Gashed with massive holes, major parts of the ship shattered where containment fields had failed on some of the ship\'s engines, it was easy to see that the ship was on its last legs. A variety of small transports and escape pods, most not graced with stealth generators, fled the area, a sizable percentage of them getting shot down almost immediately.

It hurt to watch, so he turned away.

The last remnants of *MC* in the area were already withdrawing, either directly into frigates and cruisers, or into MedEvacs streaming towards the rear. The few that remained in the area to fight were pausing, only a little, to buy the outbound MedEvacs some time, and incidentally to give Erwynmark\'s ship a little protection, while trying to hide the fact that they were protecting anything specific.

Their ship moved forward silently. It would be pointless to dock with one of the cruisers or frigates in the area, which were themselves having a hard time getting out. They had to use their low profile, small size, and great speed to reach somewhere safer in the rear. Only then could he board a larger vessel en route to one of the other battlecruisers.

They already had a route plotted out, one designed to have him eventually reach *HSS Zuo Zongtang.* Unless something went wrong, they would cruise quietly to their destination in the rear. These kinds of escapes had a surprisingly high success rate, at least for senior officers. It turned out that a small stealth ship that took the simple expedients of not doing anything aggressive and staying away from large alien vessels---which were justifiably paranoid about anything approaching them under stealth---was usually quite capable of getting through combat zones. The tricky part was not getting caught in the crossfire.

Erwynmark looked out at the battlefield around him. He had never thought himself callous to the deaths of his men, but was also well aware that to function properly, a commander needed to have a certain detachment. There was no place in that understanding for vows of revenge, at least on a tactical level.

*The only revenge I can get is victory in this war.*

A mental alarm then grabbed his attention.

\"There\'s a major wave of alien interceptors about to pass through this area,\" Charin said. \"Nine squadrons. I am taking manual control of the ship.\"

He was immediately slammed rightward as the ship pushed itself into a new course, out of the path of the interceptors.

\"What could they want out here?\" he asked rhetorically. \"There\'s nothing in this sector worth this many interceptors. And where are the bombers?\"

\"We should be clear now---\" Charin began.

She stopped as the alarm went off again.

\"They look like... they\'re pursuing us,\" she said, in incredulity. "There\'s no other explanation for their change in course.\"

\"We don\'t have enough *MC* in the area to even slow something like this,\" Erwynmark said. \"We have to try to evade. Maybe they have sophisticated sensors capable of piercing the stealth. I don\'t know.\"

\"Should I go to FTL?\" his bodyguard asked. \"Due to this ship\'s limited stealth abilities, it would greatly reduce the efficacy of our stealth.\"

Already in tactical command mode, he viewed the readouts from the ship\'s sensors, of the alien interceptors drawing inexorably closer.

\"What would really reduce the efficacy of our stealth would be letting those interceptors get on top of us,\" he said. \"Assuming they can\'t see us already. Do it.\"

Another wave of acceleration pushed him back into his seat, and this time it did not subside.

He gritted his teeth. Out here in space, with its lack of friction, what really mattered in situations such as this was the ship\'s ability to accelerate. Consequently, this ship was very good at accelerating---but not better than the alien interceptors. He knew that.

How had they known he was here?

Tactical command mode stretched the seconds out, but the interceptors were rapidly catching up. The good news was, at this speed, it looked like they could reach friendly ships even faster than that.

Making a decision, he broke radio silence, allowing the ship to transmit to the ships ahead.

\"*This is Marshal Erwynmark,*\" he transmitted, as an additional verbal message. \"*We\'re under heavy pursuit by alien interceptors. Would appreciate any assistance you could render. I---*\"

The next few moments passed in a blur of confusion and pain, as his optical implants were overwhelmed with an overflow of EM radiation.

Finally, the radiation faded, and he found himself looking at the shocked face of Charin, and the unshielded stars that now surrounded them, with... his one remaining eye. Emergency interfaces and warnings filled his vision.

\"*Raptor missile,*\" she transmitted. \"*Alicia tried to block the explosion, but it wasn\'t enough. I managed to teleport out of the ship. With any luck, they\'ll assume we\'re dead and not look at their sensors too carefully. The FTL bubble has broken, though, so we\'re below light‐speed. It\'ll take a few minutes to reach the other ships.*\"

\"*Is... is... her---*\"

\"*She\'s dead, yes. You\'ve taken heavy damage to the head. Your suit is venting air. You\'ll go into fugue soon, assuming you can survive.*\"

*Rommel?* he queried, realizing suddenly that the familiar presence in his mind now seemed to be missing.

The silence was absolute, and dreadful.

He inspected his physical condition---painfully, and manually. He felt his grasp on his own mind slowly slipping, as he looked for what he wanted.

*Suit pressure below---*

*Primary spinal connection---*

*Secondary cardiopulmonary support offline---*

*Energy reserves---*

*Damage to central nervous system critical. Estimated time to permanent loss of minimal neural function: 180 seconds. Recommend immediate fugue and placement in incubation tank.*

With what seemed like a phenomenal effort, he forwarded the report to Charin.

\"*Leave me... if you have to,*\" he thought, grasping the teleporters hand with desperate strength, amazed he still had control of his arm. "*But if you see her... tell... Mami that I... trust her.*\"

Then he toggled the fugue state, feeling what remained of his brain shutting down. In those last few moments, his mind wandered over trivial things.

One thought rang out surprisingly clearly:

*All things considered, I\'m glad I never tried to start anything with Mami. She couldn\'t take something like this, if I had.*

Then the stars around him---those brilliant shining stars, faded.

## Invictus 

> *Power Development* is one of a magical girl\'s most crucial tasks. While every contract comes prepackaged with a set of stereotyped powers and an understanding of their usages, all too often these powers come with inconvenient, unpleasant, or downright dangerous limitations. Even beyond that, it is easy to imagine what could be accomplished with a combination of powers, and the value of having teleportation *and* telekinesis, or fire *and* ice. Indeed, great power flexibility and diversity is one of the hallmarks of being an Ancient---to a certain degree, every girl accrues more and more skill simply with age.
>
> But unless you are willing to wait a few centuries for that nifty new power, you will have to apply yourself a little.
>
> Fundamentally, barring energy limitations, the only major constraint on the application of magical powers among magical girls *as a whole appears to be the limits of the human imagination; nearly every power that seems even vaguely possible has been observed in practice at some point. But for each *individual* girl, the situation is much more constrained. Nearly every girl operates, at least initially, off of her starting powers, plus some minor variations thereof. Examples of girls starting with more than one radically different power are few and far between, and most of these are wish‐based.
>
> There are two ways to extend a power set. The first, much easier, way is to work on extending variations of one\'s starting power. This can include, but is not limited to, obvious extensions, such as summoning ten spears instead of one, or cloaking a team instead of just yourself.
>
> (These extensions, while relatively simple, should not be denigrated because of that. Many such simple extensions are exceedingly useful in combat.)
>
> This can also include much less directly obvious extensions, many of which fall into common patterns. One of the most well‐known is the so‐called telecluster, the telekinesis‐teleportation‐clairvoyance‐mindreading grouping that is notoriously easy to develop a \"full house\" on, with many girls possessing all four abilities to various degrees. Others, less well‐known and somewhat more difficult to exploit, include the connection between the telecluster and electric‐or‐temperature‐related powers, or between electric and illusion powers.
>
> In many of these clusters, the connection is not directly obvious, but relatively subtle, and often relies on *mechanism,* creating a somewhat ironic subfield where science has contributed immensely to magical development. Understanding of electrons and protons allows telekinetics to attempt to create charge differentials, and allows those with electrical powers to try and move non‐magnetic objects. Understanding of electromagnetics allows those with electrical powers to generate photons, illusions, or even stealth. Examples abound.
>
> It should not be misunderstood---a girl whose original power was telekinesis is not *literally* moving electrons to generate an electric spark. Only during the initial few attempts is this true. It appears that once the concept is understood, the procedure first becomes instinctual, then seems to melt away entirely, so that the new power is generated without extraneous conscious input. The existence of the mechanistic glide paths between powers hence does not seem to be something truly fundamental, but instead seems to allow scientific, rational understanding to act as a temporary crutch, to overcome some sort of failure of imagination.
>
> For the new recruit, then, two considerations are central to power development. First is the absolute necessity of understanding the source of your power---some powers are so instinctual, purely magical, and irreducible that this yields little, but for others, the difference between a plasma fireball and a napalm fireball can be tremendous, and can imply completely different possible developmental paths.
>
> Secondly, of course, is the existence of centuries of MSY records on this exact topic, detailing the paths taken and attempted in the past by what may be thousands of girls with powers similar to yours. There is often little need to reinvent the wheel, but take care---having access to what seems to be a book of recipes can stifle creativity, and some of the most innovative power‐jumps have never been tried before. To take a well‐known example, who would have thought of constructing firearms out of ribbons before Tomoe Mami went and did it?
>
> But, of course, *two* ways to extend a power set were mentioned. The other one, the acquisition of a *de novo* power, is notoriously difficult, requiring mind‐numbing amounts of focused meditation and practice attempts, in a seeming attempt to pull something out of pure void. For this reason, it is not recommended for new magical girls. For more experienced magical girls, however, it can often be the only way to overcome a confounding rut, and the rewards of a successful power acquisition can be immense---entry into the telecluster, for example, or the acquisition of ranged powers for a melee girl who formerly had none. However, development beyond, for example, a pathetic electric spark, requires much additional investment.
>
> Some puzzling gaps in the *Accessible Power Set* still exist, however, despite generations of attempts at breaking down the walls. Some of the missing niches, such as precognition, appeared to have once been filled, before turning mysteriously empty. Others, such as the direct summoning of antimatter or a large chunk of uranium‒235, appear to have never existed at all, and have never been successfully achieved, despite repeated carefully monitored attempts. There exists, in the eyes of many, a hypothetical *Magical Protection Principle,* wherein powers which pose too much of a direct risk to human survival simply never manifest, no matter how seemingly logical one may seem. The mechanism of such a principle is, of course, unknown, and the Incubators deny being involved.

\"Hmm. So I lived after all.\"

Those were the first words relayed from Clarisse, when they succeeded in bringing her soul gem back up to a reasonable level and it was safe to have the suit wake her.

\"Is that a surprise?\" Nadya asked.

Clarisse started to sit up, but Ryouko\'s gentle restraint kept her on the ground, which was composed of the fine metallic gray sand that characterized this particular moon of Orpheus, with its relatively thick, reducing atmosphere.

\"That attack is supposed to take the life of its user,\" Clarisse said. "It was the one and only thing its original user ever did as a magical girl. She had an interesting wish. I took the bet that, in my current empowered form, I would somehow make it through.\"

\"That\'s quite a bet to take,\" Nadya pointed out.

\"I didn\'t live this long by not taking any risks. You can discover some pretty interesting things that way. I only regret---if I had known I was going to do that, I could have done it earlier, and Ying‐zhi wouldn\'t be a piece of jewelry right now. The truth is, I\'m not that surprised.\"

\"Don\'t be too hard on yourself,\" Ryouko said, feeling like it was what she *should* say, even if it felt strange coming from her mouth.

\"I\'m fine,\" Clarisse insisted, trying to sit up again. \"I\'m back up to 20% and climbing. I\'ll be okay.\"

\"It was more my fault than anything,\" Nadya said. \"I didn\'t---I wasn\'t decisive enough. I could have made better decisions.\"

This time, Ryouko let Clarisse sit up, expecting her to stand up, but Clarisse only joined Nadya in peering intently at the sky. Ryouko wasn\'t sure whether she should try to say anything, or keep quiet.

\"So it\'s still there, huh?\" Clarisse asked rhetorically, referring to the wormhole hanging in the sky above them.

\"I\'m afraid so,\" Nadya said. \"Do you think you could manage whatever the hell you just did again? I haven\'t seen anything like that since New Athens.\"

Clarisse shook her head.

\"Not for a couple of days, at least. I\'m sorry.\"

\"Well we need to think of something to take down this last stabilizer core, then,\" Nadya said. \"According to Gracia, they\'re just free‐firing their orbital artillery at the last one now, without us even being there---it seems they\'ve figured out we can tell what\'s real and what\'s not. That\'s going to be difficult to get at, especially with our barrier generator on ice.\"

\"I just had a terrifying thought,\" Misa said, appearing next to the rest of them. \"What if we\'re wrong about these damn wormhole stabilizer cores, and blowing them up doesn\'t really do anything? The aliens have surprised us all before, and it\'s shaking my faith that even though we\'ve destroyed all of them but one, the damn wormhole stays perfectly intact. I mean, no one had any idea they were even capable of turning this wormhole on.\"

\"You mean you didn\'t have that thought before we arrived here?\" Nadya asked, shaking her head. \"It doesn\'t matter. We have to operate on the information we have. Those cores *look* important, the core *was important in the only other wormhole we ever saw, and we haven\'t found any other source of power or gravitational distortions. If we blow up the last one and nothing happens, then we can discuss further.\"

\"They just seem way too happy to blast their own control equipment and trained personnel,\" Misa responded, shaking her head in turn. \"You\'d think some of that fancy equipment would actually be important for something.\"

\"Do we know we\'re safe out here?\" Clarisse asked, pushing herself up off the ground, soul gem now at 40%. \"I mean, we\'re standing out here in the open, on the surface of the moon. I don\'t see what\'s keeping us from getting shot at from... anything, really. Or receiving an up close and personal nuclear weapon detonation, like the last team.\"

Nadya put her hand to her visor, imitating a girl putting her head in her hand.

\"We don\'t,\" she said. \"Not really. But nothing has happened yet. Still, we\'re pressing our luck, standing around out here like this, even if we\'ve been trading off using our stealth powers. That\'s why we have to think of something, fast.\"

\"Well, if none of us have any better ideas, I actually have one,\" Misa said. \"I almost did it earlier, actually. It\'s terrible and desperate, but it might work.\"

*Share it with the team, then,* Nadya thought.

*Well,* Misa began, but stopped abruptly, spotting something over Nadya\'s shoulder. The others turned to look.

Gracia had been standing on a small boulder with Mina and Annabelle, watching the horizon, but now she was looking at the sky, utterly ashen‐faced, with the other two staring at her in confusion.

A moment later, the news showed up on their internal interfaces.

*HSS Raven* had been discovered, had come under fire---and Gracia could no longer find it, or any trace of Juliet, who she had been quietly keeping magical tabs on. She hadn\'t yet managed to find any debris from the ship, but the conclusion was inescapable: the ship, their only way home, had been obliterated. They wouldn\'t be going home.

Before Ryouko had even fully processed what had happened, Misa started laughing spasmodically, dry and high pitched.

*Well,* she thought. *I was going to have you girls hold onto my soul gem for me, but that\'s not even that relevant anymore, is it? Nevermind, I\'ll still give it to you. Maybe you all will come up with some kind of miracle, some way to stay alive on this moon until we get rescued. I have faith.*

Without really understanding what was happening, Ryouko staggered on her feet, but found herself propped up by Clarisse\'s hand. They made eye contact for a moment.

*I don\'t understand,* she thought, relaying the thought privately. *My wish---I thought---*

*It\'s not fulfilled yet, is it?* Clarisse thought back. *That\'s alright. Neither is mine, I don\'t think.*

*I feel selfish, worrying about that, when Juliet is* dead *up there. But I can\'t---I can\'t seem to care about that right now.*

She wasn\'t sure why she even mentioned it, and immediately regretted it, realizing she had sounded a bit incoherent.

Clarisse glanced at her, though, and thought:

*I wouldn\'t worry about something like that. We\'re all entitled to think about ourselves, at a time like this.*

Then Clarisse bent her head for a moment, and Ryouko thought for a moment that her skin glowed just a tiny bit violet---but then she blinked, and the glow was gone.

\"Listen up!\" Clarisse said, startling Ryouko with her sudden change in tone and body language. \"I know we\'re all shocked by the news, but we still have a job to do! I know I don\'t have to tell you that. I\'ll have you all know---\"

She walked away from Ryouko to the front of the group, talking as she walked, then turned dramatically, pinning each girl in turn with eyes so bright they were almost glowing.

\"I personally have no intention of dying here,\" she continued, \"and neither should you. We\'ll find a way! We\'ll hijack a ship or something. And just to reassure you, if you\'re still worried, if you die, I\'ll be right there to collect your memories, and the Goddess will show up for your soul! Now, I know a lot of you don\'t believe in her---\"

A light chuckle, as she rubbed her hands.

\"---but she exists! I\'ve seen her myself! If she turns out not to exist, you can come back as a ghost and call me a liar!\"

It should have been absurd, the girl in her violet armor, face behind a visor, standing on a rock in gray metallic sand, body framed by the black alien sky, but, unbelievably, the unorthodox speech seemed to pep the group up a little, granting them a bit more energy. Even Ryouko felt a little better, and she saw Gracia and Mina bow their heads reverentially.

Ryouko remembered her childhood, reading about the things Clarisse had done, trying to imagine what it was all like. Clarisse\'s charisma was part of the legend, her incredible ability to rally people in even the most dispiriting of situations.

It was all well and good, but somehow, she had imagined it being... different than this.

Somehow, it seemed---

*---too effective?* Clarisse asked, voice whispering in her head, eyes looking at her. *Yes, it is. Actually, I\'m using a mild form of mind‐control to apply a moderate morale boost. It\'s a little bit cheating, but...*

Clarisse didn\'t finish the sentence, and Ryouko let out a breath. It was* cheating, but as Clarisse alluded to, it probably didn\'t matter.

Still...

*You know,* Ryouko thought, to her TacComp. *Even though I talked with Asami earlier, I still don\'t feel satisfied. I feel...*

*Regretful?* the device supplied.

*Yeah. And I guess I should be glad I talked to my parents, but I don\'t really know. I feel like I should be crying or something right now, and maybe thinking about them more, but I don\'t have that feeling.*

*I don\'t think there\'s a right way to face death,* her TacComp thought. *And for all we know, you* would *be crying if Clarisse weren\'t here. Besides, we\'re not going to die here.*

Ryouko blinked.

*What?*

*You heard me,* the device thought. *I\'m stuck inside of you, and I\'m not going to let myself die that easily. I don\'t have a cushy afterlife waiting for me, after all.*

Ryouko knitted her brow, legitimately surprised, but before she could decide whether to pursue the topic further, Misa signaled to them that she wanted their attention.

*Alright,* the girl said. *This is the plan.*

She put her fist to her mouth, clearing her throat, the rhetorical nature of the gesture emphasized by the visorplate between her mouth and hand, tanned skin and long hair barely visible underneath her helmet.

*I\'ve noticed this for a while now,* Misa said. *But this moon is actually storing up a tremendous charge differential between the ground and the region immediately above its atmosphere. I\'m not sure exactly why, but I assume it has to do with its current interactions with Orpheus\'s magnetic field. Ordinarily, lightning discharges would keep the charge from building up too much, but for some reason that doesn\'t seem to have happened here---I think it might be all the conductive metal on the surface dissipating the ground charge. Anyway, this moon\'s atmosphere is ripe for a massive lightning storm, or even a single discharge.*

She paused, looking around to make sure they all followed.

*I\'ve been reluctant to use my lightning so far, partly because we\'ve been indoors so much, but also because I\'ve been afraid of accidentally triggering something too massive. Now, for the last wormhole stabilizer core, I can try to use my body to channel all the electricity deliberately at the forcefield, but... well, I can make my body a conductor, but only up a certain point. You put enough electricity into something, and it will fry. I can use magic to protect myself, but for something like this, I don\'t think I\'d have enough power to keep my body intact.*

She stopped, taking a breath, then held up her hand, and to their surprise, discharged her soul gem into her open palm, walking over to Clarisse.

*I have the most confidence in your survival, out of everyone present*, she said, handing over her gem. *Please take care of it. We\'ll teleport a hundred meters from the stabilizer core, and then one of the teleporters can drop me next to the core. I will use as much magic as I safely can, and sacrifice this body to try to take it down. Don\'t worry about me. This isn\'t my first body. I\'ll be okay as long as you get my gem out. I... don\'t actually know how you\'re going to do that, but this whole thing is a long‐shot, so whatever.*

She stopped the telepathy, looking at them, clearly done speaking. The others stared for a long moment, until Nadya stepped forward, embracing her old comrade briefly.

*I\'ll be there when they resurrect you,* she said. *Count on it.*

Misa nodded, and it seemed to Ryouko that the girl\'s eyes were briefly misty. Though Ryouko would never admit it, it confused her a little---by the girl\'s own admission, it wasn\'t her first body, so what was there to be sentimental about?

Clarisse cleared her throat, getting their attention.

*I don\'t mean to interrupt, but we do have to move quickly, if possible, and before we do, we have to decide what we\'ll do after the wormhole goes down, presuming we succeed. If we do intend to survive, that is. I actually have a proposal now, for what it\'s worth,* Clarisse thought.

*That I was buying time until I thought of,* Ryouko thought, completing the sentence mentally. She didn\'t share that particular thought publicly, however.

The group turned to look at Clarisse, who took a moment to check that they were all paying attention before conveying, in heavily accelerated telepathy:

*Well, it seems to me that we\'re inevitably going to have to spend some time hiding out on this moon. That could be weeks; it could even be months---or it could be a day. It all depends on how the battle above us turns out. Obviously we can\'t stay anywhere near the alien base, even if we blow it all up, but if we stay on the surface for any extended period of time we\'re going to be spotted easily by orbiting observers.*

She paused rhetorically for a moment, before continuing.

*That\'s why we shouldn\'t stay on the surface. We will teleport a great distance from the base, then either dig or use clairvoyance to find a suitable location underground, and then we will stay there. The primary constraint on how long we can hold out is grief cubes, and unfortunately our supply is not that vast. However, I do have a few time manipulation powers on tap. Usually, they are used to make your enemies slowed, but in this case, the goal would be to slow our own personal time, so as to drag out grief cube usage. A temporal stasis, of sorts.*

Again she paused, checking to see if they understood.

*Unfortunately, there are a number of caveats here. The first is that we will be very vulnerable while slowed‐down---if I kept myself slowed‐down, it might take me so long to deactivate the power that we will all be dead by the time I finish, purely from the lag in reaction time. At the same time, I can\'t place myself outside the field, since the whole point is to reduce grief cube usage, and if I\'m generating the field, I will be the biggest consumer of all of us. We will have to rotate having someone on watch outside the field, so that if something happens they can buy time while I shut down the field.*

*The second caveat is that my access to all these powers is contingent on being near a major historical event, and temporal manipulation is not one of my native powers. If the event ends, my access to my powers will rapidly deteriorate. It depends on whether the resolution to this event is sudden or drawn out. If it is sudden, I can buy time by slowing time to delay the deterioration, but eventually I will lose access to the power entirely. I don\'t have a great solution for this, unfortunately; we will have to see.*

*Finally, and maybe most importantly, we can\'t think only of personal survival. There is a chance that we may destroy the wormhole stabilizer, but the aliens conquer the system anyway. In that situation, they will likely rebuild what was destroyed. We don\'t know why this moon in particular was chosen; they may choose to rebuild the stabilizer somewhere else, in which case this last point is moot. But if they choose to rebuild on this moon, it would be our responsibility to try to destroy it again, if only to buy time. When my ability to slow time runs out, we may find that we only have one choice. We have to be mentally prepared for that possibility.*

Her speech done, she clasped her hands in front of her, bowing her head slightly.

*I can\'t honestly say I\'d ever thought I would be in a situation quite like this, but I\'ve always taken life as it is. At my age, you learn that you can hardly do anything else. The plan I just outlined is convoluted and desperate, but I think it would be our best chance. That applies to the plan Misa suggested as well. I think the time for talking is over.*

There was a long pause, greatly exaggerated by the relative speed with which Clarisse had been communicating. Finally, the pause was broken, not with words, but with the appearance of an operational brief within their TacComps. Misa had taken the time to elaborate on what she had described earlier, but the broad strokes were the same. Members of the team fiddled with elements of the plan, usually the parts involving themselves, but no major revisions were made. It was going to be fast, even by their standards---it was either going to work, or it wasn\'t.

When the time came, they gathered around Ryouko. It had to be Ryouko, because it was too far for Mina---Ryouko had carried the team out here, as far as she could manage without overly taxing her teleportation resources, which she had been husbanding so that she would be able to make the jump back to their ship when they were done. That was obviously not relevant anymore.

As she always did before performing a jump like this, she took a deep breath. She reflected that if she was going to die here, at least it was on an alien world. The Shizuki Ryouko that had made her wish would have said that it was better to die like this, than to live her whole life on Earth. She did not disown that opinion, but now that she was faced with the prospect, she found herself more ambivalent than she would have expected.

And then she made the jump, and there was no time to think.

They reemerged at the point chosen by Gracia, a small ledge near the edge of the region voluntarily devastated by the alien orbital artillery, almost exactly one hundred meters from the device. The rest of the team immediately set to work securing their position, while Ryouko, Misa, and Clarisse continued with the plan.

Ryouko teleported the three of them immediately above the exposed stabilizer core, and Clarisse immediately activated a previously unseen flight power, keeping them suspended in the air. Simultaneously, she raised her hand, and a giant rock wall, colored sandstone red, appeared above them, the product of another of her magical abilities. Hopefully, it would shield Misa long enough from orbital artillery for her to perform the necessary channeling.

Ryouko looked around for a moment, at the empty chasm in the facility around them, Misa hanging onto Clarisse\'s arm, the black starry sky in the distance, partly obscured by Clarisse\'s wall. It was, in some ways, a wondrous sight.

*Godspeed,* Clarisse thought. *Let\'s go.*

They reappeared at the metal ledge, the other girls having established a perimeter around them. Ryouko looked at the wormhole stabilizer, and at Misa, who was now hovering in the air, suspending herself with magnetism to the metal of the facility around her. The beginning shots of a barrage of orbital artillery struck the rock wall, massive pieces of sandstone dislodging and vanishing as their magic failed. It clearly would not last more than a few seconds longer.

From a hundred meters away, Ryouko watched as Misa broke out into a slow toothy grin, raising one arm dramatically.

*Oh God, there\'s more power here than I thought,* the girl transmitted with her telepathy, grin spreading wider. *This will be great. I\'ve always wanted to do something like this.*

She spread both arms out wide above her head.

*Lord Jupiter!* *Father of lightning! Grant my wish! Call down the thunder!*

Before Ryouko could finish processing the absurdity of the statement, and its relation to the gas giant that hung in the sky above them, a sheer, world‐shattering actinic light blinded her, wiping the thought from her mind. She raised her arm instinctively to block against the glare, brighter than Sol, as her optical implants recalibrated.

Then she saw Misa, body a blazing silver silhouette contrasted against the column of light, the wrath of a fundamental force of nature. A sea of electrons swelled outward, still discharging, even gaining in strength. There was no sign of the rock wall, or any of the inbound orbital artillery.

Then Ryouko became aware of the inferno that had formed in front of her, the furious heat buffeting her face with sudden hurricane force, the discharged energy having nowhere else to go. Her nose twitched as the smell of ozone approached the unbearable.

*It\'s not just the moon\'s atmosphere,* Misa thought, from somewhere distant. *The planet itself---the magnetic field---I got so lucky! It\'s a flux tube discharge!*

*We can\'t stay here!* Nadya thought, to the team. *This place is turning into an inferno! At this rate, we\'re all going to get fried!*

Clarisse had already thrown up another barrier in front of them, of a different kind, blue and glowing, but the radiant heat was still overwhelming. Debris in the chasm below them started to shudder and crumble, and the ground---was it *melting?*

*We have to stay!* Clarisse responded, doing the telepathic equivalent of shouting. *I\'m holding her soul gem! Until we\'re sure the stabilizer is destroyed, we have to stay, and make sure it receives as much energy as possible.*

*How on Earth could it survive all this?* Mina asked incredulously.

*Have you seen a nuclear explosion up close?* Clarisse asked. *I have, and I know that the one I saw wouldn\'t be enough to destroy the stabilizer\'s damn forcefield. We have to make sure!*

*I hate to ask this,* Ryouko said, *but is she still alive in there?*

Then, implausibly, the column of electricity in front of them began growing,* the beam of overwhelming light tearing the ground apart as it spread outward. Ryouko\'s eyes flashed through the EM spectrum, and she could see that the air in the chasm was nearly gone, blown away or turned into vicious plasma. Clarisse\'s barrier was the only thing ensuring they still had oxygen.

*It\'s getting hotter!* Nadya said, unnecessarily.

*Go!* Misa urged, and this time the thought was strained, rather than euphoric. *I can\'t sustain this much longer! It doesn\'t matter anymore. This is beyond my control either way. Go!*

Clarisse closed her eyes, grimaced, then grabbed Ryouko, as the others had already started to do. Ryouko closed her eyes in turn, and left.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They reappeared a few kilometers from the facility, on a small metallic outcropping jutting out of the sand that bordered the facility on one side. For a moment they were tense, watching the area warily for threats. Then they relaxed, a little, and turned to look at what they had left behind.

It was the most beautiful thing Ryouko had ever seen.

The beauty was composed half by the aesthetics of the scene---the writhing column of white‐hot electricity burning into the already scorched hole in the alien facility---the bolts of lightning that shot irregularly out of the column, punctuating the air with a delayed thunder that served as counterpoint to the constant roar of the tortured air---the alien base\'s internal forcefields struggling to contain the impossible energy, sections of the base already a radioactive ruin---the stark barren surface of the alien moon---the distant blackness of the unfamiliar sky---the crazed twisting of the stars above them, where the alien wormhole was clearly, finally, starting to lose its coherence.

The other half of the beauty was that of the atom bomb, of the Eviscerator laser, of a thousand artillery shells falling from the sky, of chaotic, roiling wings stretching across the sky, as black as the darkness of the human heart. To Ryouko, who had seen similar scenes only in simulation, it was an austere beauty, one of the many faces of death herself.

They watched for just a little longer, at the torrents of energy that continued to pound downward, and the whiter‐than‐white glow reflecting and dispersing in the thick atmosphere of the moon, coloring the sky in all those colors that Ryouko had finally accustomed herself to seeing, the thermal red and electric purple of the near infrared and ultraviolet. Cycling through the rest of the spectrum, she saw an ocean of radio waves, a column of turgid x‐ray, coursing out of the sky like an angry dragon, and even the bright glimmer of gamma radiation.

She had never before asked herself what it would sound like to have a wall of unending thunder beating at her ears, from a thunderbolt that never, ever stopped. She knew now, though, even through all the damping the suit and her tympanic implants could provide. She could even feel the roar physically, as it beat violently against them.

In all that, the alien base was almost an afterthought, the cynosure of the devastation swallowed almost instantly, as if its forcefields were not even there.

The escape plan called for Ryouko and Mina to chain teleports as far as reasonable from the alien facility before looking for an underground location they could hide in, once they were sure the wormhole was truly out of commission. That last part was the most important, of course, but even if they had been set on fleeing as fast as possible, it seemed doubtful they could resist the natural human impulse to turn around and watch.

*Do you think we\'ve truly destroyed it?* Nadya asked, turning her head to look up at the distortion in the sky. *And even if we have, how long would it take them to rebuild?*

*If I were closer, I could tell you if the aliens are panicking or not*, Gracia thought. *But there\'s no reason to approach. We should just wait, and watch. As for rebuilding---we nuked the facility. Twice. I feel like we\'ve done an acceptable job.*

They continued to watch as the wormhole above them began to oscillate more and more wildly, the stars in the sky shifting wildly back and forth, fading in and out, the sky even seeming to splinter in places, as if violently unhappy with its current appearance. Ryouko began to feel a bit of unease---but also, strangely, excitement. They had done it, of course, but it almost seemed as if she were excited about the spectacle itself, as if the stars shifting in the firmament were a fireworks show that moved some deep part of her.

Finally, the light and roar coming from the facility began to fade.

*You should start looking---* Clarisse began.

With a loud crumbling noise, the ground underneath them jerked suddenly, and only enhanced reflexes saved most of them from falling.

*Earthquake,* Annabelle commented unnecessarily, as the ground continued to shake.

*It\'s not unexpected,* Nadya thought. *The Saharan wormhole emitted significant gravitational distortions when it was collapsing. In fact, it sunk into the nearest gravity well as it was collapsing, for reasons we don\'t understand. That\'s why the original plan was to get back to the ship ASAP. We can only stay a little longer, and then we have to move. We don\'t want to be here when what\'s left of it hits the surface. According to the models, the space‐time distortions can be extremely dangerous.*

*We can watch from further away if we have to,* Clarisse agreed. *At least by sensor.*

*I agree,* Nadya thought. *In fact, it\'s time we left---*

She stopped, as they all registered internally that an alarm had just sounded from her and Gracia\'s gravitational sensor packs.

*Error/Warning: Local graviton probe results uninterpretable. Local space‐time does not conform to stored theoretical model.*

*I\'m pretty sure we should leave,* Clarisse thought, with deliberate understatement. *Breaking your understanding of reality is never a good thing.*

The group, which had only scattered slightly post‐teleport, immediately reformed around Ryouko. With their accelerated thoughts and actions, it was a process that would only take fractions of a second.

That was too long.

Somehow Clarisse reacted fast enough, perhaps faster than should have been possible, throwing up a barrier only a few milliseconds after the wave of pressure and heat slammed into them, overwhelmingly strong, powerful enough to knock Annabelle and Mina to the floor and hot enough to set armor damage alarms blaring in Ryouko\'s mind.

*The hell was that?* Annabelle thought, as the group reoriented behind the barrier, rapidly scanning for threats. It took only a moment for them to notice what had changed.

Instead of the almost‐serene landscape that they had just been staring at, the landscape around them looked devastated, in a way none of them had ever seen before. The ground and facility in front of them seemed damaged almost in patchwork fashion, almost as if the region had been bombarded with a peculiar form of precision artillery. Spherical pockets of the facility were gone, seeming to have completely vanished. Others had merely suffered extensive damage, shattered and melted, and a few, the most puzzling, seemed to be completely intact, as if shielded by small spherically shaped forcefields specifically devoted to their protection.

The ground around them told a similar story, forming a helter‐skelter pattern of circular regions that were red‐hot and melting, regions that were scorched, and regions that seemed untouched. Large cracks fractured the ground like a spiderweb, testifying to the tremendous stress the crust of the moon was under.

It was the lightning that first revealed what was going on. The electricity from Misa\'s earlier attack had not entirely dissipated---instead, pockets of it seemed almost trapped in midair, frozen still. As Ryouko watched, a single surreal bolt of lightning traced its way slowly to the edge of its bubble, then, upon reaching the edge, completed the rest of its course in an instant.

*Warning: Space‐time distortions in vicinity extremely powerful,* their sensors warned, belatedly. *Recommend departure if possible.*

Gracia pointed upward, and they looked.

The sky immediately above them was covered in circular distortions. Some appeared as bubbles of raging hot air, their surfaces intensely bright when viewed in infrared. Many, however, were only obvious with careful inspection---these fell slowly through the air, carrying within themselves a different pattern of stars, the fragmented remains of what had been a massive interstellar gateway---except that that *made no sense.*

*How?* Nadya asked. *What the hell is this? We should have had plenty of time to escape!*

*We were too careless,* Clarisse thought, hands stretched outward, telepathic voice strained. *Remember the funnel, on the gravimetric diagram of the wormhole? The one stretching up from the stabilizers to the wormhole? When we took down the last stabilizer, the funnel must have broken apart and saturated the area. We were trapped in a bubble of slowed time.*

*That makes no sense!* Gracia interjected.

*I* know *it makes no sense!* Clarisse thought, her mental voice galloping faster with every word. *I\'m making this up as I go, but it\'s the only explanation that fits the facts. And since I was preparing to use my time‐manipulation powers anyway, I was barely able to sense time starting to slow. I\'m accelerating time right now---a bit faster than the time away from the moon, actually; that\'s the only reason we have the luxury of standing around discussing the issue. But I didn\'t react quite fast enough. The remains of the wormhole have already descended on us. Eventually, they will dissipate, but not before they probably tear us apart. In fact, the temporal distortion we\'re standing in is sinking downwards. Unless we intend to go down with it, we\'re going to have to pass through the boundary, and I\'ll be honest: I don\'t think we can. Not directly. Just so we all understand the situation, I suppose, but really I\'m talking too much, since I can\'t keep this up much longer. Mina, Ryouko, can you get us OUT OF HERE?*

In response, Mina picked up one of the moon\'s strange metallic rocks, staring intently at it briefly.

*I can\'t,* she thought. *The boundary is impermeable to me. I can\'t teleport the rock out.*

*Ryouko!* Nadya thought, turning her head. *Ryouko---what the hell are you doing?*

Ryouko, whose soul gem light sensor had gone off the scale, was still watching the sky.

## Deus ex gemma 

> The division between Army and Navy, seemingly obvious to civilians, is in fact often quite blurred, leading to occasional friction between the two branches of the Armed Forces. While on a lower level, the distinction between an infantryman on the ground and a gunnery officer on a starship seems quite obvious, the line becomes harder to draw the higher up in the military hierarchy one ascends. At any level higher than the merely planetary, cooperation between ground‐based and space‐based forces becomes essential, necessitating a joint command. The early refusal of the post‐Unification Wars Army to subordinate itself to the upstart Navy (then called the Star Navy) has led to the current curious situation, where field marshals and fleet admirals both regularly hold commands over both fleets and planets.
>
> The distinction that must be drawn is thus more subtle than that between ground command and space command. Fleet admirals and admirals stick more to their fleets, gaining and losing command over fixed regions of space based on where they are stationed to---during times of active attack or retreat, this may shift seemingly continuously. Field marshals and senior generals stick more to a region of space, gaining and losing command of fleets as they enter their region of space.
>
> Even then, the distinction often fails to hold well. For instance, Tomoe Mami\'s involvement in the Saharan Raid was a classically Naval operation, despite her appointment as a Field Marshal.
>
> In the end, it falls upon the General Staff, as well as its extensive network of human and AI advisors, to lubricate the operations of military command, keeping the two branches working together in harmony.

> One source of tension between Naval and Army commands is the management of planetary orbital defenses, particularly the composition of Orbital Command (OrbCom). While in safe systems OrbCom naturally falls under the purview of Army commanders, the advent of intra‐system combat usually adds a significant, sometimes massive Naval fleet presence to planetary orbit. While the AIs of both branches are able to ensure effective low‐level cooperation, disputes between high‐ranking human officers over the exact command hierarchy, and over the ability of both sides to requisition reinforcements from each other, have occasionally led to acrid, sometimes public disputes. It is for this reason that a planet\'s ground forces and orbiting fleets are usually placed in the command of a single Field Marshal or Fleet Admiral, who can arbitrate any disputes and reassign any problematic commanders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Will this woman just stop talking?*\" the hand‐written note said. "*This is sooo boring.*\"

*Ryouko frowned at the mini‐tablet, slipped to her by Chiaki, one of the few people she knew who carried an old‐fashioned tablet and stylus around.*

\"*Maybe to you,*\" she wrote back. \"*But you\'re just bored by anything that doesn\'t play music. Stop complaining.*\"

*Shoving the tablet back between their desks, Ryouko refocused her attention on the lecture in front of her. It was a unique opportunity, provided by their school---a world‐class physicist, stopping by to give a special lecture. Sure, it was simplified non‐mathematical stuff, but the lecture was still worth paying attention to anyway.*

\"*At the center of the developing singularity,*\" *the lecturer continued, calling up a diagram on the wall behind her,* \"*as the density of the star approaches the Planck density, a unique phenomenon occurs. The graviton boundary on four‐dimensional space‐time becomes unable to contain the pressure, and ruptures, so to speak---*\"

*The diagram, of a space‐time surface bending, suddenly burst open.*

\"*But of course, no true rupture occurs. The mathematical structure of the boundary forbids exit from the boundary---what occurs is more accurately characterized as a phase transition. Spatial locality breaks down, and for a moment the point of the singularity is connected with literally the entire universe---well, that is what the theory suggests, at least. That is not what most of us really believe. In any case, however, gravitons from the rest of the boundary instantly rush across the non‐locality, and within an extremely brief period the nonlocality becomes contained, connecting the singularity to only one other point in space‐time. This may be characterized in some ways as a tunnel through the higher‐dimensional space, and indeed this is what was understood in classical General Relativity as the Einstein‐Rosen Bridge, though of course this convenient mental image is not fully accurate. In fact, there are several analogies to quantum teleportation that must be considered equally valid.*\"

*The women looked down for a moment, frowning in thought.*

\"*There are a few technical details of importance here. The 'width\'*\"*---she raised her hands to make the air quotes---*\"*of the bridge is only the Planck distance and, for practical purposes, it can transmit no matter‐energy, although information transfer is permitted. In addition, while such bridges could theoretically connect regions spanning the entire observable universe, in practice the geometry of the higher‐dimensional space greatly biases bridge formation in favor of points close in space‐time---where, of course, \'close\' has to be understood on an astronomical scale. The half‐maximal radius of the probability distribution depends on the mass‐energy of the singularity. Those of you familiar with IIC technology will recognize that it is this property that dominates the energy‐distance relationship of transmission nodes.*\"

*The lecturer frowned again, then smiled slightly, looking bemused, toying with her hair.*

\"*Well, it is also true that for well over a century, it was believed that there was no way of expanding the width of the wormhole, even with exotic matter. While there is no direct evidence that alien wormholes are directly analogous to what I am describing here, the circumstantial evidence to that effect is fairly strong. Obviously there is something here we still don\'t understand. But of course, if science were so easily solved, it would be boring.*\"

*The lecturer stopped, looking around as students raised hands to ask questions. It was then, and only then that Ryouko looked closely at the physicist\'s face.*

\"Joanne Valentin,\" she said, out loud in surprise. \"But why haven\'t I ever---\"

That revelation, as startling as it was, was immediately swamped by another, much greater revelation.

*I know how my power works,* she thought, with an instinctive finality whose source she could not trace. The memory had struck her like a thunderbolt, seeming to seize her attention and force her to remember, in the middle of the most dramatic of possible moments.

She would have liked to investigate that fact, but there were more important issues at the moment.

Ryouko looked up at the fracturing space‐time above her, the anomalous stars in their three‐dimensional bubbles.

*My teleportation range is constrained by the amount of energy I can pour into a single singularity at once, which in turn is limited by how well I can bend space‐time around me. But if the space‐time around me is already significantly warped...*

She blinked, as ideas began to appear in her mind, new bounds and limitations on her magical ability, but also new opportunities.

*I can get us out of here,* she thought with astonishment.

*Girls!* she thought, spinning around to face the rest of the team. I---*

Ryouko stopped. Instead of the living, breathing team she was expecting, she found the rest of them standing around, as if frozen in time, Clarisse with her hands spread in front of her to project a barrier and time acceleration field, Nadya lunging forward at Ryouko, mouth open behind her visor to yell at her.

Yet, despite the circumstances, it did not seem as if they were truly frozen in time. In fact, her team, and the world around them, seemed strangely, indefinably *fuzzy,* and too white. In fact, it almost seemed like she was---

\"You may want to hold off on teleporting out, at least for the moment,\" a familiar voice said, from somewhere to her left.

Ryouko spun around and stared, just for a moment.

The woman stood in front of her, in an absurdly elaborate layered white‐and‐pink dress. Impractically long, flowing pink hair framed an ineffably familiar face, one that at the moment looked strangely amused. The last time Ryouko had seen that face, it had been winking at her.

Behind the woman\'s back, a pair of abstract, transparent wings spread outward, though at the moment they seemed ghost‐like, almost invisible.

\"You!\" Ryouko exclaimed, pointing at the woman with her right hand.

A moment later, she realized how inappropriate the gesture, and her response, had been, and she snapped her hand back, hiding it within the palm of her other hand as if it embarrassed her.

The woman bowed her head slightly, in the polite fashion.

\"For the record,\" she said, smiling, voice melodious, but strangely childish. \"That vision with Valentin‐san would have happened regardless of my meddling---it\'s more of a magically‐induced memory than anything. Most magical girls understand how their power works the moment they contract. For others---it takes a special moment. Contracts are funny like that. And since I know you\'re wondering, I require certain catalysts to grant visions---well, easily at least. The ribbons I gave Homura‐chan are an example, but Clarisse‐chan\'s soul gem will serve in a pinch. Actually, it only works at certain historical moments, and I usually use it to give visions to *her,* but that\'s all details. She doesn\'t know I can do it for anyone else. There\'s metaphysics here---I used to know her, things like that.\"

Ryouko just stood there listening, gaping. The woman spoke with seemingly idiomatic Japanese, but it seemed off somehow, just like---

*Just like Mami and Kyouko\'s Japanese,* she realized.

\"You knew them, didn\'t you?\" Ryouko asked.

The woman chuckled.

\"That is just like you, isn\'t it? Might as well ask while you\'re here. Meanwhile Clarisse‐chan is lying low, trying to pretend like she isn\'t there. All very characteristic.\"

\"What?\" Ryouko asked.

*She\'s talking about me,* her TacComp explained. *I guess I should have expected I couldn\'t hide myself.*

*What are---how are you---*

*Not like I know any better than you do,* Clarisse thought. *I\'m just here. I figured I should stay quiet.*

\"Listen up!\" the Goddess interrupted, turning away from her, pink hair swirling. \"You destroyed the wormhole stabilizer, which is quite an accomplishment, but it\'s not enough. As it currently stands, the battle is lost.\"

The woman reached in front of her with one gloved hand. In front of it, what appeared to be a portal swirled open, showing Ryouko the bright, sunny landscape of a different world---the bright, sunny, ruined urban landscape.

The Goddess turned back around, gesturing at Ryouko to approach with her other hand.

Ryouko stepped forward uncertainly.

\"This is only a vision,\" the woman said. \"Don\'t worry; you\'re not going anywhere. I couldn\'t do that if I wanted to. I\'m just giving you a little perspective.\"

Ryouko looked up, and they made eye contact.

For a moment, Ryouko lost herself in those golden pupils. Those weren\'t just eyes, a part of her whispered irrationally. They were windows to something. Within those eyes, on the other side, there were worlds upon worlds, soul upon soul upon soul---

And then she felt herself being *shoved,* the Goddess pushing her physically into the portal in front of her, so that she stumbled forward and fell---

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*We have to hold the line here.*

That was the implied message being relayed downward from high command, probably from brigadier general Shirou Asaka herself, who, as Patricia well knew, was more reluctant than most to issue orders to hold \"at all cost.\" And yet that was the general tenor of the directives being handed down.

Her barrier generator, a relatively new recruit named Shen Qing Lan---though she preferred \"Anne\"---kicked open a door in front of her, dashing forward out of the building, barrier raised, as the rest of Patricia\'s personal bodyguard followed her lead. They had to stay on the move, stay mobile.

*I can\'t believe things turned out like this,* she thought, again to herself. It served no purpose, grousing like that, but it made her feel better, just a tiny bit.

It had seemed like such a routine affair, at first, or as routine as things got in wartime, even in such a situation as this. She had been informed about the new wormhole, of course---everyone in the system had, as a matter of course---and fleet resources were being diverted from throughout the system to try and contain the situation. That included, of course, fleets in orbit around the planet Apollo. With their departure, the aliens had decided to act aggressively, drawing upon their reserves to effect a wave of landings onto the planet, including directly into the capital city of Heliopolis. It was a sign of how bad the situation had gotten that the aliens felt bold enough to skydrop directly into the defenses of a major urban area, but the situation was bad in a lot of places, and alien dropships and transports were dropping through the overstretched orbital defenses at a murderous pace.

*Sector seven has been compromised---reported landings in rear of sector five. Buildings 7A, 7B, and 7D report themselves completely surrounded; command post seven is no longer mobile and cannot hold. Major Baygi requests artillery bombardment of current position.*

Lieutenant Colonel Patricia von Rohr paused, understanding the ramifications of an officer calling down an artillery strike on his own position---but she only paused for a moment.

*Approved,* she thought. *Tell Sectors 8 and 9 they must hold to the last man. This line must be held at all costs until we receive our armor reinforcements.*

Patricia gritted her teeth. The battalion\'s command structure was dangerously overstretched, and she had lost so many officers---including her primary tactical deputy, the unit\'s mobile AI cluster, and the already‐dead Major Baygi---that they were struggling to maintain command cohesion. The loss of organized command was the death knell for a unit, so even with the liberal distribution of field promotions, Patricia had been forced to take on more and more personal command, micromanaging individual squads and even soldiers in a way that she would never have to do normally. There was only so much she could handle, and she had already been forced to more or less stop paying attention to her own surroundings, allowing her TacComp to move her body in autopilot. It was a problem, because it deprived her of the ability to use her own powers, but she was being forced into an unpalatable tradeoff between command efficacy and magical power usage, between command efficacy and how effectively she could defend herself and use her magic to penetrate the enemy networks.

*This isn\'t the kind of mission this battalion is intended for,* she thought angrily, at---who? Fate?

There was no one to blame. Her artillery battalion was designed as a rapid‐reaction fire support formation, usually held in reserve except when acting as support for other units. The battalion was composed of specialists for the role---medium‐range missile launchers, medium‐range artillery, and long‐range snipers. From a magical girl perspective, the battalion contained a mixture of distracters, artillery, and specialists, which was common vernacular for \"girls that had powers that aided dodging\", \"girls good at long‐range bombardment\", and "miscellaneous\", respectively.

Patricia herself fell into the category of \"specialist\", but she led this particular battalion for a reason. From a combat perspective, her most useful skill was her ability to enter the otherwise impenetrable alien networks. In terms of specialists, the battalion also contained a mind‐reader and a clairvoyant---combined, the effect was to create a battalion unusually skilled at penetrating the otherwise inscrutable alien command and communications structure, both for disruption and simple intelligence‐gathering. Magical girls capable of penetrating alien networks, such as Patricia, were very rare, and very valuable.

She sighed, quietly.

*There\'s at least three things wrong with this situation,* she thought glumly.

The first was that instead of acting as support for other units with heavier firepower, they had been sent out to crush an alien landing personally. They didn\'t have the right equipment for that. She hadn\'t been too surprised, though---their resources were stretched thin, and when the warnings began arriving from the Aer Magi and Magi Cæli units above them that alien dropships were inbound, into a sector where they were the only remaining reserve unit, Patricia had ordered her battalion to ready itself for combat, because the implication was obvious.

The second was that, as she had discovered when they arrived on the scene and she tapped into the alien network, the scale of the alien landings was an order of magnitude beyond what had been expected, and were accompanied by a heavy armor and air thrust from troops already planetside.

The third was that except for the shattered remnants of defensive units that they had picked up on the way there---now temporarily reassigned to her command---there were no other units in the area to prevent a crushing breakthrough. The only thing preventing breakthrough at the moment was Patricia\'s own interference in the alien network, sowing confusion, misdirecting commands, and delaying force concentration, while also directing artillery at threatening units in the rear. It would only work for a while, though---eventually, they would sort out their command issues, and either way, no amount of command interference could hold back truly overwhelming force.

Thus, they had to hold the line. There was no one else to do it. All they had to do was hold out until Asaka was able to gather the necessary reinforcements and send them forward in a counterstrike.

*It can\'t take that long, right?* she thought.

*Requested reinforcements inbound,* she received finally, almost as if on cue, the thought relayed to her all the way from Asaka herself, somewhere in her command bunker, causing Patricia to physically sigh in relief. Patricia knew without being told that the thought had likely made numerous jumps on its way to her, passing from electronics to magical girl telepathy to electronics to telepathy over and over again, until it finally reached her. One advantage to telepathy: it was unjammable.

She also received a map and timetable for the expected arrival.

*This is... not really what I was hoping for,* she thought, noting that the arrival wasn\'t anywhere near early enough.

She did not bother to relay the information further; it would propagate itself automatically to everyone relevant. Doctrine held that for maximal combat effectiveness, it was necessary that every single soldier, down to the lowest private, understood their entire tactical situation.

Patricia\'s \"command post\", a mobile grouping that consisted of her, her bodyguard troops, and their cloud of drones, was currently in the process of dashing between a set of buildings in the rear. Higher officers had actual physical buildings or vehicles as command posts, filled with computing equipment. Lower officers rarely got that luxury, simply because such posts were obvious targets and required a lot of protection. They relied instead on mobility.

*I\'m here,* her newly assigned second magical bodyguard relayed, appearing on a nearby rooftop and diving dramatically out of the sky in a blur of blue. Kishida Maki was not a teleporter, and was thus not really capable of filling the role once held by Xochitl Isi, Patricia\'s teleporter, who had been killed in the initial attack. However, Maki was an illusion generator, and could perhaps provide enough distraction for Patricia to escape sticky situations. They could only hope that would be enough.

Plus, it helped that Maki\'s ability gave her the ability to cross the battlefield to Patricia relatively safely.

The two friends nodded at each other, then at Anne, and the rest of her bodyguard moved across the rubble‐strewn roadway.

*Alright,* she thought, allowing her legs to carry her across the rubble‐strewn street. *We only have to hold---*

It took only a slight mental ping, the slightest intimation that something was wrong, to send her into a powered dive, using her powerful legs to launch her across the remainder of the street, then converting her forward momentum into a roll so she could keep moving.

Moments later a barrage of laser fire fusilladed the area she had been passing through.

*Damn it!* she thought, as her bodyguard troops responded immediately, snipers and auto‐railguns opening fire from temporary positions in the buildings above onto the group of alien stealth infantry that had appeared in the street---a rare Exterminator strike group, specialized for the elimination of commanding officers, magical girls in particular.

Some of the positions fell silent immediately, terminated by other alien infiltrators. Deprived of their easy kill by Patricia\'s well‐timed dodge, the aliens were switching to Plan B: deprive her of an escape route by seizing the buildings around her, then finish the job before the human forces in the area could try to save her.

Patricia was painfully aware that if she had been more focused on her powers, rather than the functions of command, she could likely have detected the aliens before they arrived. Clairvoyants were rare enough to be precious on a battlefield, but her ability to pick up on drone activity, both friendly and enemy, meant that she could mostly accomplish the same purpose when it came to stealth detection.

She followed the instructions of her bodyguards as they ushered her inside the building she was next to, flanking her sides.

Patricia took a moment to scan the path ahead for alien drones as they hurried through the ground floor of the building, participating only perfunctorily in the decisions being made by her bodyguard troops. On a tactical level, she had to trust that they knew what they were doing, better than she did.

Instead of heading for a secured room in the lower reaches, they continued navigating the building. Patricia knew what this meant: they didn\'t think they could secure the building well enough for safety, so they would be making a run for it instead, hoping to breach the alien perimeter.

They ran through a maze of corridors and offices, whose now‐useless walls and furniture served only as a depressing reminder of the civilians the building had once housed. The single‐piece colonial furniture had been torn to pieces, either used to help barricade doors, or simply reprocessed for energy by one of the many soldiers and drones passing through. The walls were white, interspersed by patches of the smartwall ubiquitous on Earth and the occasional half‐functioning holo‐poster.

They burst back into the open from one of the service entrances of the building. The group of drones taking point fell to pieces in a barrage of fire, but the infantry that followed leveled suppressing fire at the origin of the shots, losing two members. A moment later, Anne dashed through the doorway, raising a protective barrier that provided just enough cover for Patricia and Maki to run past and into cover on the other side, in an alcove that had apparently once served as the entrance into \"General Tso\'s Gourmet Chicken\", a one‐story structure that seemed out of place in this city center.

Anne followed immediately afterwards, taking only a moment to look askance at the restaurant sign. Around them, torrents of laser fire took their toll on their supporting bodyguard troops.

\"*We\'re taking too much attrition, sir,*\" the sergeant in the area commented to Lieutenant Kishida, who was already moving out.

Three human armored vehicles appeared around the corner at the end of the street, drawing alien fire as Maki dashed outward, her movements a blur. A column of blue platforms appeared in the air next to the building across from them, as the vehicles disappeared into a pool of paint, having served their purpose.

Maki scaled the building, jumping from wall to platform to window and back out again, hardened platforms dissolving into dye as she used them. Illusory copies of herself followed her movements upward, while apparent bullets, projectiles, and suicide drones showered into the alien positions from a variety of plausible angles, disappearing as they struck the alien shielding, providing additional distraction as she eliminated machine gun nest, sniper, rocket launcher, twin swords slicing and dicing the alien infantry.

As Maki worked her way back around towards Patricia and Anne, a quiet rumble above their heads drew their attention.

Anne slammed her hands upward, materializing a barrier just in time as the alien explosives finished detonating, bringing the structure down around them.

*How the hell did they guess we\'d go* here? Anne cursed, as she angled her barrier to force the collapsing ruins of the---fortunately small---building away from them. They had moved forward, away from the building, and Anne unleashed another curse, this time in a colonial dialect of Chinese Patricia\'s TacComp didn\'t bother to translate.

Without quite knowing why, Patricia dodged rightward, just in time for a barrage of bullets to miss her. With her bodyguard squad still in chaos from the building collapse, they had lost suppressing fire---and Patricia had been flushed briefly into the open.

Redirecting more of her consciousness back into personal protection, she began to dodge---right, then left, then forward. Anne was new and, frankly, not as powerful as Patricia would have wished. She couldn\'t keep up this level of deflection for long.

With a burst of power, she seized control of a few of the alien drones that had been firing on her, turning them on their old allies, while Anne clapped her hands desperately, summoning wave after wave of sonic shockwaves that rattled and shook the buildings around them, dislodging pieces of masonry and collapsing windows. Patricia had to hope that all of that, plus the barriers Anne was still throwing up, would buy enough time.

*Patricia!* Maki thought, conveying a clear note of desperation.

Patricia spun around, already trying to jump away, but she knew, seeing the missile coming, that it was too late.

And then a blue caped figure landed in front of her, five meters away.

\"Maki!\" she yelled, as the detonation started to resonate in her ears. Glancing around, she saw Maki\'s signature apparitions begin to fall apart---she was either dead, or nonfunctional.

No, not dead. She could still sense the girl\'s power, just a little.

\"*Situation critical,*\" Patricia relayed to anyone who would listen, as she had already been doing for minutes now. \"*Anyone capable of assisting please help!*\"

With that, she dissolved the last of her tactical command mode, diving forward into the explosion\'s area of effect, where debris was still raining downward. No longer constrained by attention issues, she summoned a full flight of drones to accompany her and absorb any incoming fire or shrapnel. Into her hand she summoned her signature weapon---a large dull‐gray drone‐launcher that wrapped around her arm.

*Found it!* she thought, as one of her drones was able to grab Maki\'s soul gem and fly towards her.

Turning around, she reached outward, co‐opting every alien drone she could find, while still summoning yet more of her own. Breaking into a run for cover, she used the alien drones to wreak as much havoc as she could with the alien battle coordination, as she raised her arm, launching fusillade after fusillade of everything she thought would help: explosive suicide drones here, EMP drones there, flying stinger drones into the air, gun platforms into the windows nearby.

She was still in trouble; they still had yet to break out of the alien perimeter. She needed---

A barrage of kaleidoscopic beams appeared in the sky above her, raining onto the contested area in front of her. Each behaved differently---some detonated on contact, others curved and twisted through the air as they sought out targets---but there was no mistaking what this was.

*Cavalry\'s here,* a feminine voice explained to Patricia, as she finally reached cover behind the remains of a stone bench. *Alpheus Squadron, at your service. Shirou Asaka authorized us to rush ahead of the column, since we heard you needed help.*

Patricia looked up, optical implants adjusting to the glare of the sun, at the group of girls that were darting among the buildings, on a variety of magical jet packs, rocket boots, and diminutive wings. True fliers were rare, so these were substantial reinforcements indeed.

She nodded, as she noted that her support troops had managed to take up new positions around her. As she placed Maki\'s soul gem into better storage in her equipment pack, she prepared to return to tactical command mode, already holding in her mind\'s eye tactical maps of the armor entering combat, arriving almost literally straight off the factory floor.

But something made her stop, and take one last look at the corpse she had left behind. It was gruesome, with torso torn away from legs and most of the skull missing. Unlike infantry, magical girls planetside wore no armor, so when they bled out, they really *bled out,* relatively speaking.

Patricia had seen its like before, in the weeks before, but she still shuddered, and turned away.

She looked up, as another wave of dropships broke through their air defenses.

It was beautiful, in a way, like a meteor shower---but these shooting stars brought death instead of wishes. Reviewing the tactical situation, she could see that Asaka had barely stabilized the situation, the reinforcements that were now arriving forming the opening salvos of a massive, desperate counterattack. It could work, but it was risky---if the aliens had even more reserves, it would finish them. That was beyond the control of anyone on the ground.

She peered into the distant sky.

*What on Earth is going up there?* she thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Surfacing from the vision, Ryouko coughed, stomach churning slightly, but the flood of borrowed memories was relentless, and she was drowned once again...*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mental alarm, so familiar over the past day, had screamed painfully loud in her mind, tearing her away from the bosom of a half‐hearted rest trance. It continued to tug at her attention as she and the infantrymen in her vicinity scrambled to mobilize, hastily checking weapons and power levels on their armor suits---most of them had remained standing, something that was surprisingly easy to tolerate if you were willing to abuse combat mode.

It was like an itch she couldn\'t scratch, one that clung at the depths of her mind until it was satisfied, and would not *let go.*

\"Tell me, Lieutenant,\" she complained, as they began to power‐sprint down the hall, her suit transmitting the audio. \"Why is it that these kinds of alarms don\'t leave us alone when we\'ve clearly already gotten up, started rushing down the halls, and activated full combat mode?\"

\"I believe it\'s to help keep us focused, sir,\" the lightly‐bearded man replied, looking perplexed. \"Combat statistics show it helps improve response times.\"

\"Yes, Lieutenant, of course,\" she responded, a little dryly. It had been a rhetorical question, but the lieutenant was a literal man, as she was slowly learning. There had been a lot of personnel transfers recently---those with naval training transferred out of the station, those without transferred in from other sectors. Only today had they learned what it was all about.

As they traversed the corridor, she took a moment to glance out the holographically‐simulated station windows, looking inward towards the super‐ship assembly area at the core of the Pollux Shipyard complex, and at the dusty, partial golden orb of planet Apollo that dominated the horizon beyond. The shipyard as a whole was actually a series of tethered space stations, arranged in concentric circles horizontally and, to a lesser degree, vertically around the central assembly area, and furthered serviced by other stations elsewhere in geostationary orbit. In ordinary times, steady ship and space elevator traffic provided additional raw materials both from the planet below and from space above. The complex was placed in relatively high orbit, to make the safe capture of asteroids into the shipyard easier, but also couldn\'t be *too* high, to facilitate transfer of goods to and from the surface below.

In such ordinary times, the rings of stations would often serve as feeder subassembly areas for the main assembly area, where the largest ships of the fleet would slowly take shape. At any given time, the shipyard would likely be assembling any number of frigates at the periphery, a smaller number of cruisers near the center, and, at the very center, perhaps a carrier. Only on rare occasions would the shipyard turn its attention to the assembly of a battlecruiser.

She had seen herself, a few times, the initialization of such a battlecruiser assembly. It was majestic, in its own way, the slow tugging of the captive asteroid into the central assembly area, the stations shifting orbits to make way, the small fleet of worker ships and drones on standby. Finally, with almost painful slowness, the asteroid would dock, the injection stations would make contact, and things would begin. For months the work would proceed nonstop, crews drilling into the asteroid, drones of every size---down to the microscopic---working to turn unrefined iron‐nickel into military‐grade metamaterial composite. The foundries, fabrication facilities, and microassembly plants of the shipyard would churn out the countless computing cores, nanoassemblers, transmission relays, and engine parts that went into an undertaking of this magnitude, while the station AIs gathered to design and assemble the kernel of a new battlecruiser AI, the economy of the planet below shifting its weight to accommodate the task. It was the only time the central assembly areas ever truly served their true purpose.

Now, though, there was no such megaproject. The shipyard and its supporting stations were devoted fully to the task of churning out orbital defense stations, Guardian‐class cruisers, and other planetary defense accoutrements. The shipyard itself had been outfitted with a substantial number of fixed defenses: FTL interdiction generators, anti‐ship railguns, and countless flak emplacements. The once mostly‐civilian personnel were now reinforced by a military garrison that tripled the population of the station. Space was at an absolute premium.

But many of the personnel had left only recently, and at this particular moment, the sky around the shipyard was filled with seemingly endless combat, the back and forth of the shipyard\'s fleet defenses, stripped barer than they had ever been, being placed under severe strain. The defenses of the shipyard itself now fired constantly, and damage control teams hurried back and forth to repair damage. Alien starships and insertion teams constantly tested their defenses, no longer being fully contained by the outer defense lines.

It was difficult, knowing that the fate of the station, and thus by extension her fate, rested primarily with the performance of the fleet jockeys in the sky around them, rather than anything within her direct control. She was used to it, though---had to *get* used to it, given her assignment to a vulnerable orbital shipyard.

Around her, the squad assigned to her made small talk, smiling or joking, the few newer replacements looking nervous. The platoon had separated into squads, advancing down various parts of the large, circular recreation area they were passing through, as civilians in the area looked on nervously. The lieutenant, her subordinate, had joined a squad on the far end of the room, behind the large cylindrical arboretum that decorated the center of the room---or rather, what *had* been an arboretum, but was now being used as a sleeping area.

The squad accompanying her at the moment was militia, volunteers to transfer up to the station for a chance at something greater, maybe even a promotion into the regular forces. Initially, that had meant obsolete weapons and gear in a well‐defended location like the shipyard. Over the years, veterancy had dulled the distinction between militia and regular military, and about a year ago they had started receiving shiny, brand‐new weapons and armor, erasing any meaningful distinctions that remained.

Often, in land units, the militia was separated out into their own divisions, even their own armies, but up here at \"The Station\", having a separate chain of command would have been unduly cumbersome, so separation only occurred at the platoon level. It suited her purposes fine.

She frowned under her faceplate, disturbed at how slow and intermittently information was being relayed to her. Usually, by this point in a rapid response she would already have substantial information about the nature of the threat they were dealing with, whether it was a search and rescue for civilians, whether it was an outbreak of alien minidrones that had snuck through the defenses, or whether it was one of those rare alien suicide insertion teams, launched in the hopes of finding a soft spot in the station\'s defenses where it happened to lack magical girl cover. They were having more luck today than she wanted to think about; much of the shipyard\'s mage garrison had been shifted elsewhere, either to defend the reaches of high orbit or to try to interdict the increasingly severe alien landings on the cities below. Radiation and antimatter sensors were sensitive enough that insertion teams couldn\'t sneak truly dangerous weapons through the forcefields---but that didn\'t mean they couldn\'t wreak absolute havoc with conventional weapons and explosives.

It was difficult to think about mages without thinking of---

\"Cut the chatter,\" she ordered, decisively. \"Something\'s up. This isn\'t an ordinary raid. We\'re walking into a communications black hole. We don\'t know what\'s in there. I want this taken seriously. Stay frosty; stay on your toes. Get the civilians out of here.\"

Her order applied not just to them, of course, but to the rest of the company, including several platoons that were advancing on the alarm area, a large cruiser engine subassembly facility, from different directions entirely. All around the room, individual squads scattered into covered positions along their axis of advance, as the civilians who had been lounging in the area began to hurry out the other way, agonizingly slowly from her mildly time‐slowed perspective, used as she was to the lightning quick movements of her soldiers in their power armor.

Of course, the details of her command had been relayed in machine language long before she had finished talking, but it was good practice to give verbal instructions whenever you could spare the time.

The company converged on the facility, individual members of each squad taking turns dashing forward into cover positions suggested by their TacComps, as smooth as a well‐oiled machine, accompanied by drones scurrying and flying into useful support positions. As they moved into the entry corridors to the subassembly area, she took a moment to mull over her options, processing the information she was receiving over the local networks. According to the station AI, station defense could not immediately spare any mages for them, though some would be moved over as soon as possible. The subassembly facility was considered valuable, more valuable than the paltry lives of her whole company, if need be, especially considering they weren\'t contributing directly to the battle in the skies above.

She activated the full extent of her combat enhancements, performance statistics flooding the lower levels of her consciousness.

\"We\'re going in,\" she said, having already received the concurrence of Station Command. \"Go, go, go!\"

\"Be ready for heavy jamming,\" she heard one of the lieutenants say. "Remember that we have no signals from inside the facility.\"

\"Careful with your fire in there,\" another said. \"Some of those engine components are quite volatile.\"

The various platoons had, of course, started moving in the moment the orders had been fully relayed, including all the nagging details the lieutenants had said, but it still felt good to say.

In situations such as these, speed was of the utmost. Entryways were often slaughter points, so it was critical to get as many people through and into cover as soon as possible, so they could provide suppressing fire for anyone that followed. A swarm of drones, including several large ground drones, would rush in first, followed by the squads taking point, who had the unenviable position of probably taking the most casualties, but someone had to do it, after all.

And yet, when she herself burst through the doorway with her squad, going last as befitted the company commander, she found the platoon scattered around her seemingly casualty‐free, even among the drones---seemingly, because their near‐field and long‐range communications had gone dead, leaving the various officers to issue their orders the old‐fashioned way---by hand signal. Looking around, she could see elements of the other platoons in distant positions behind robotic assembly arms, containment units, and standing on several floors worth of walkways. The facility was large, large enough that her hundred‐some soldiers seemed to melt into the surroundings, and large enough that she couldn\'t spot most of the other platoons.

The normally active assembly robots were quiescent but undamaged, and the human personnel of the facility seemed to have collapsed where they stood, though some showed signs of having tried to escape. From infrared, it seemed like they were still alive.

\"Be careful of stealth,\" she said, out loud over external speakers, lifting her enormous weapon. Privately she thought: *What the hell?*

\"Let\'s sweep our area,\" she said. \"And try to pass information back and forth. Hopefully---\"

She felt herself being flung aside with sudden, concussive force. With accelerated reactions, she managed to start turning midair, so that she landed into a roll, stopping behind a nearby storage container, back slamming into a railing.

She barely managed to orient herself, already firing at the red area where her TacComp calculated that any enemies were likely to be. She heard an explosive crumbling, and noted that the entryway they had entered through was collapsing on itself, that the aliens were firing at the doorway.

Gunfire began sounding throughout the area, and a specialist in her squad fired a wide‐dispersal area‐denial shock grenade from her suit arm, designed specifically for revealing stealth units in close combat. Their small drones peppered the area with careful fire and miniature explosives of their own, exchanging fire with a large set of suddenly uncloaking alien drones, while two of their large \"dog\" drones dashed rapidly back and forth, trying to make physical contact with an alien trooper, which was emitting some kind of repulsive field. Even with heavy alien jamming in the area, the drones were intelligent enough to cooperate well.

It didn\'t matter, as both drones fell apart a moment later, sliced cleanly in half by laser cutters from an invisible source.

The specialist fell to the ground a moment later, clutching briefly at an apparent wound in his abdomen, the brief shimmer of an alien stealth trooper passing by, revealed by the grenade. As others tried to track the trooper with their fire, falling back, she loaded a grenade into her arm---standard concussive---and launched where she expected there might be more troopers.

She fell backward with the rest of the squad as another member fell, firing on the sparks of shields activating where she had launched her grenade---a good guess, after all.

As she did so, her mind raced, even by the standards of the accelerated combat mode. Part of her sought to coordinate with her squad, her TacComp overlaying several new recommended positions over her visual field. Another part of her wondered at the strange alien tactics: Where was the laser fire? The barrage of explosives? Even the concussive grenade that had hit her group was relatively weak.

*Why haven\'t we taken down any alien troopers? We should have gotten some! Unless---heavy shielding? Commandos? Do they have commandos? Why did the specialist go down so quickly?*

Stopping to allow her weapon to reload, she turned and dashed for one of the new positions indicated by her TacComp.

Half‐way there, a searing laser shot out of the ground where she was about to step, and she barely managed to dodge out of the way---but the laser hit her heavy assault rifle, which immediately ruptured explosively, scarring her armor.

She swore, tossing the weapon away, still running. Some sort of new landmine---this was a trap!

Reaching her new position, behind a robotic auto‐assembler, she glanced back at the rest of her squad. Over half the members were now missing, two of the others had lost function in major limbs, and one had lost his weapon. They were still fighting, but the situation was dire.

She noted that the sound of gunfire in the facility, once thunderous, was starting to palpably lessen. They were losing badly.

*I brought my whole company! How many of them are there? How could they sneak in so many?*

*What is the point of this exercise?* she thought despairingly. *To trap and annihilate one human unit? Destroy the facility? Is that worth how many troops they sent? Because they can\'t possibly escape now.*

Another set of explosions, and she found herself dodging manically, as the walkways above her head began to fall to the floor.

Then she stepped on another mine, and this time the laser seared off her hand.

She didn\'t stare at it in shock, or feel any pain---the combat enhancements ensured that. Instead she dodged, trying to find another safe spot, the gaping wound at the end of her arm already beginning to seal.

And then she felt a sharp, piercing pain in her gut.

She looked down, at the blood pouring out of the wound, as she fell to the ground, suit power failing inexplicably.

*Core systems un... respon---* her TacComp began, before *stopping, just like that.

For a moment, she could still see, her vision blurring, the shimmer of an alien commando passing over her.

She had left her family, everything behind, because---

Then the world blacked out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Medium‐range transit nearly complete. Task force prepare for ready stance.*

That triggered a wave of nervous telepathic chatter in Nakihara Asami\'s flight wing, which had been on edge nearly the entire trip. Asami herself, however, stayed quiet.

*You okay in there? You seem a little out of it,* her wingmate Hosna asked.

The telepathic words, unexpectedly clarion, cut through the fog that had settled over her mind, causing her to blink in surprise, behind the faceplate of her flight suit.

\"Oh, I\'m fine,\" Nakihara Asami insisted. \"I\'m fine. Just watching the sky.\"

\"Watching the sky\" was a Magi Cæli euphemism that had developed for the practice of using one\'s magical powers to search the sky, whether it involved clairvoyance or, in Asami\'s case, gravity powers. Asami, however, was a bit prone to zoning out while doing so, which had caused the phrase to acquire additional connotations when used by her wingmates.

It was more than that, though, as Hosna was proving annoyingly successful at intuiting. Asami had been spending the time obsessively probing the Grapevine for news, so much so that her contact to the network, a certain Ophelia over in Dardanelle squadron, had warned her about overuse.

She couldn\'t help it; it was maddening to be alone out here, without a single piece of news to reassure her.

Well, technically that was untrue; apparently, Ryouko had spent a small amount of time on the surface of Apollo, training for some sort of hush‐hush mission with an elite MagOps squad of some sort. The individuals and people involved were well‐known: Nadya Antipova was famed for her powerful telekinesis skills and was a minor celebrity in Russia; Misa Virani was apparently well‐known in a city in New California for some stunt she had pulled there while on vacation---the exact details had been buried, in one of Governance\'s few instances of unavoidable, explicit secrecy. The team they led, along with their ship, HSS Raven,* had quite a reputation, having been spotted in the vicinity of major MagOps successes on multiple occasions. Certain fans on the Grapevine had used circumstantial evidence like that to build up a substantial dossier of missions.

Even more exciting than that, at least to denizens of the network, was the sudden appearance of a certain Clarisse van Rossum halfway through their training. Asami had been forced to look up the woman, apparently an Ancient of substantial reputation who had nearly a cult following online. Her participation in an event was taken as an indication that something big was going to go down. Asami was amazed that she had never heard of the woman before.

All very exciting news, news that Asami had gorged herself on like a VR addict being given access to a high‐end Governance server---or, indeed, like she herself felt sometimes, near the gravitational anomalies that ebbed outward from starship engines. It had taken a while to learn to suppress the strange giddiness that sometimes washed over her, which had already triggered some giggles in the rest of the *MC* training cohort.

None of it, though, told her anything she really wanted to know---what was Ryouko doing? What were her chances of survival? On this, the network remained silent, the military\'s secrecy for once apparently winning the day.

Now that the battle had developed to this point, only the members being held in reserve really had the time to actively speculate on what exactly *HSS Raven*\'s mission was---extra‐system IIC bandwidth was being reserved for matters of military importance. Much speculation focused on the wormhole stabilizer whose presence had only been announced to the fleet just before the current operation. It made sense, but they couldn\'t be sure, because there was no evidence.

So instead Asami\'s mind ground its gears in silence. To some degree, she was glad for the combat, which took her mind off things. It was the pauses, the occasional periods of disengagement as they returned to their support ships, or flew temporary holding patterns in their suits as they traveled between destinations, that really got her. It was so easy to just let her TacComp take over the flying, as she continued to think---

*Asami! Are you in there or what?* Hosna yelled again, trying to get her attention.

She startled, the intervention of her TacComp preventing her from jerking her limbs. The TacComp was capable of forcibly seizing her attention for combat reasons, but did not do so for less important reasons. Not to mention it wasn\'t directly capable of picking up on telepathy. Part of her envied Ryouko her new version TacComp, but given what she had said about the device---well, Asami wasn\'t sure about wanting something *that* human inside her.

Meiqing and some others from the training cohort had somehow started to suspect that Ryouko had a new version, though Asami had no idea how.

*Well, it certainly wasn\'t me,* she thought. *I\'ll have to tell Ryouko---*

*Agh, I\'m still thinking about her. Focus!*

*I\'m fine, yeah,* she managed to say back to Hosna, as the world snapped back into focus around her. The blackness of deep space, the tormented view of the sky from inside their fleet FTL bubble, countless starships in the sky---all of it hung around her in eerie silence, the larger ships seemingly stationary, the fighter‐class ships and drones constantly bobbing and weaving about. It was amazing, how used she had gotten to it, at least with her mind as distracted as it was now.

*I told you she\'s not okay,* First Lieutenant Hosna said, with a trace of anger, directing the comment at Jong Yi, their squadron telepath and commanding officer, or SCO for short.

Asami didn\'t hear the response, which Jong had probably sealed into a private telepathic channel, but she knew what the captain was probably saying---she had overheard them arguing in the hallway earlier.

\"*Look, I submitted the report accurately,*\" Jong had said. \"*How was I supposed to know they\'re pushing psych‐class C\'s into combat now? I was expecting them to send her to a therapist, not send her out with us! If I had known, I would have exaggerated a lot more. What\'s done is done; we\'ll just have to keep an eye on her.*\"

\"*It\'s not right, sending a rookie out like this, on half‐training to boot,*\" Jean added, after a long moment.

\"*She\'s doing quite well, for a rookie,*\" Jong said. \"*You saw the bombers she took down earlier. Look, let\'s stop talking about her like she\'s not here. You okay over there, Asami?*\"

\"*Yeah, I think so,*\" Asami responded---truthfully, she thought. "*I\'m just a little distracted. I\'ll be okay if we start fighting.*\"

\"*I think we can rely on that,*\" Jong agreed.

Asami doubted she would have even asked if she thought the answer would have been different---the captain was a telepath after all, and could read Asami\'s mind perfectly well. Plus, Asami\'s soul gem meter served as reassurance. Sure, the maximum level was a bit lower than usual, and the depletion rate was a little high, but overall the statistics were within acceptable range.

*Well, we\'re going to need some of those anti‐bomber skills soon,* Jean commented, gesturing in front of her. *We\'re getting really close now.*

Asami swallowed, trying to push down a sudden frisson of nervousness. Up until now, they hadn\'t really been in the battle. Assigned to the cruiser *HSS Otto von Bismarck,* their task force had been held in reserve at the rear of the formation, and had consequently dealt only with the occasional alien penetration raid---harrowing to be sure, but not at all like what the veterans had described a battle as being like.

Now, though, Anand\'s faltering attack had been deemed secondary to Feodorovich\'s much larger and more successful surprise offensive, and her fleets had abruptly withdrawn. Most of the fleet had moved to join Feodorovich, the more depleted formations pausing to regroup and repair, but much of the reserve had been transferred back in system, where the twin worlds of Apollo and Artemis were apparently under severe assault.

*Form up, girls,* Jong ordered. *This is going to be hot.*

New orders began to trickle in. The task force as a whole was going to reinforce the fleet stationed in defense around the planet of Apollo, where alien starships were starting to break open wide holes in the planet\'s orbital defenses. Many of the group\'s *MC* squadrons were assigned to follow them on this mission. However, some of the *MC squadrons, more specialized at transport interception, would be shifted into a more defensive role, along with a small number of ships to help carry them into new positions. Some were being sent to try and screen the planet from the alien drop ships heading for the surface. As for the rest...

\"*You\'ll be covering Pollux shipyard,*\" their squadron\'s CMCG---Commander, Magi Cæli Group---relayed. \"*It seems like the aliens are trying out a new tactic with heavily‐armed, unusually‐large stealth ships. The shipyard has already lost some important facilities to this new tactic. The hope among OrbCom is that assigning some* MC *squadrons with stealth‐detection will neutralize the threat.*\"

Among other things, that meant Asami, of course, since even alien stealth systems weren\'t perfect at hiding the gravitational effect of their exotic matter engines, and Asami was excellent at sensing that kind of thing.

\"*The shipyard also needs immediate support against an incoming group of transports, so expect contact the moment you exit FTL,*\" their CMCG finished.

They engaged their propulsion packs, rearranging themselves into a preplanned formation, Jean, Asami, and others with repulsion powers in front, Hosna and Jong farther back. The squadron\'s drones, which had surrounded them as a cloud the entire way forward, rearranged themselves in a similar fashion.

A few frigates, as well as the Otto von Bismarck, broke off from the main task force, combined FTL bubble breaking off from that of the main group in a manner exactly analogous to the behavior of soap bubbles. These frigates carried their squadron, along with a few others, to the shipyard, while the rest of the task force headed elsewhere.

Asami took a breath, as multiple barriers flickered to life in front of them. She gestured her arm slightly---a habit she hadn\'t been able to get rid of---and another barrier appeared, an invisible region of negative space‐time curvature visible only to her.

Another breath, and a small gravitational anomaly appeared in front of her. Her primary weapon, a miniature singularity, sounded impressive---and, okay, was pretty impressive when she used it---but it wouldn\'t have amounted to much without the effort she had to put in to amplify its strength outside of its event horizon, to make the event horizon *much* larger than it should have been, given its mass, and to keep the Hawking radiation leakage to manageable levels. It was a lot of work!

That was why she only kept one going at any given time.

As their FTL bubble began to dissolve, they engaged their stealth packs.

The view that appeared around her was awe‐inspiring---radiation flared into her view from a thousand sources, from energy scattering off of starship forcefields, from countless engines of every size and shape, from the shattered wrecks of countless ships. The golden orb of the dry planet Apollo dominated the sky, its atmosphere punctuated by the fiery re‐entry of countless objects---wave after wave of alien drop pods and drop ships, many intact, many shattered into pieces. Uncontrolled collisions between the innumerable broken pieces of debris created enormous debris fields in orbit, ensuring a seemingly endless rain of small, deadly projectiles onto their squadron defenses.

Before her, the numerous installations of Pollux shipyard strew themselves about, enormous concentric circles clearly labeled by her TacComp in the field of her vision. Some of the installations had clearly been blown apart, but the shipyard seemed, as a whole, intact.

The gravity---she could feel it in her heart, the thrumming of so many engines, the violent disintegration of so much exotic matter, freed from containment, all of it spiraling in the gravity well of the planet below. It was a veritable playground of gravitational anomalies.

And they were getting closer, their small formation knifing forward, directly into a large cluster of defense ships, alien cruisers, heavily‐armed alien transports, and assorted escort ships for both sides. This cluster was engaged in a densely‐packed firefight---\"knifefight\", according to *MC* terminology.

Many of the alien transports and cruisers had now been revealed, either via direct detection by OrbCom clairvoyants or due to the weapons fire they directed in support of their sister ships. These transports were a novelty, armed with an armament of hard radiation bombs and Raptor missiles far in excess of the typical alien transport. Perhaps most disturbingly, the sheer magnitude of the stealth the aliens had utilized was staggering in comparison to anything they had done previously in the war. Not only were these stealth cruisers and cruiser‐sized transports more than an order of magnitude larger than any stealth ship previously known, the transports had also cloaked a substantial accompanying population of drones and escort ships. It was worth asking: If the aliens could cloak this, what *couldn\'t* they cloak?

*Teamwork, girls!* the captain ordered, raising her ruby‐tipped scepter. All at once, dozens of red lines, curved, jagged, and straight, appeared around them, passing through their formation. Each one represented the intention of a sentient enemy attacker.

*Does she know how lame she sounds when she says that?* someone in the squadron thought---leaving the captain out of the telepathic channel, of course.

*Stealth, my ass,* someone in the squadron thought, simultaneously. These stealth packs ain\'t worth shit.*

Allowing the rest of the group to cover her, Asami closed her eyes, extending her gravitational senses outward toward the cluster of ships. She could tell... she could sense...

As OrbCom\'s clairvoyants had suspected---but not been able to pinpoint---not all of the alien ships had chosen to reveal themselves with their weapons fire. Quite a few, slipping past the rest, were still trying to sneak by the defenses to the shipyard.

Taking a breath inside her helmet, Asami marked the locations of the ones she could find. Once precisely located, the clairvoyants could keep an eye on them without her help---hopefully, anyway---so that ships and other squadrons in the area could do something about it.

And then there was no more time to think, as the drone cloud of their formation slammed into the cluster of alien transports, injecting yet another source of chaos and destruction into the scrum.

She projected her repulsion field forward---attempting to clear a path for her squadron through the sea of drones, weapons fire, and missiles---as the rest of the girls fired their longer‐ranged weapons, a group of robotic MedEvacs appearing behind them, some having literally just emerged from the shipyard. As they did so, they began to collectively decelerate, under the influence of their suits, Asami\'s gravity, and a sort of collective telekinesis, just as in training. It would not do to keep flying forward at their previous speed, which would have carried them rapidly into the alien formation, far past their own support ships. Slowing down made them more vulnerable to targeted fire, but it was also the only way they could perform any attack that was more than just a long‐range potshot.

Collectively, they searched for targets, ideally a large alien ship that just happened to be traveling at their exact velocity, or something close to it, and even more ideally one they happened to already be near.

A moment later, OrbCom forwarded them a potential target, a cruiser Asami had identified earlier, now almost directly in front of them, designation number 517, trying to make a run for the shipyard. In all likelihood, the ship hadn\'t realized it had been detected.

They accelerated forward, seeking to close the remaining distance before the ship, or any of its frigate escorts, noticed their sudden change in combat posture. The distance estimates in Asami\'s upper field of view scrolled downward, reaching 200 km, 150 km, 100 km...

Then, as they began to slow back down, Asami withdrew her focus from the direct combat for a moment, seeking to detect the location of the alien drive core---

*There,* she thought.

She had barely completed the thought when their group teleporter spread out her dark orange teleportation bubble, grabbing Asami, Jean, and a few others, and---

The next moment, Asami found herself within the engine room of the alien ship. The austere curved walls, white and gray, rapidly became tarnished with dark green ichor and black char marks, and the white and gray turned harsh with reflected radiation, viewed with her rapidly transitioning optical implants. Jean\'s barrier held back a storm of alien weapons fire, the other girls responded with attacks of their own, and Asami stepped up to the wide opening that led to primary alien drive core.

The metallic orb, almost the size of an entire frigate and glowing with blue Cherenkov radiation, hung in the air, the artificial gravity disabled in its area of the ship. Numerous tubes connected to it from the spherical walls, glassy and eerily reflective. In the simulations, Asami had always thought that an alien engine room resembled the central room of an austere temple, a shrine built to worship the mysterious spherical idol that dominated its center. To her, it seemed entirely appropriate: the alien drive thrummed with power, far more elegant and beautiful than its human equivalent.

Here, near the central core, there were no weapons emplacements, only a small emergency forcefield that shimmered in front of the core---FTL cores were delicate things, and did not function well without careful isolation.

She spread her arms outward, allowing the singularity she carried with her to rise in front of her, radioactive aura surrounding an angry pitch‐black core that, out of the blackness of deep space, was suddenly very obvious. She grew it larger, until the formerly football‐sized anomaly seemed to stand in front of her, larger than she was.

In front of her, the core grew visibly perturbed, its formerly steady glow beginning to shudder. And perhaps perturbed *was* the right word---according to her reading, these drive cores had multiple organic components that aided their computations.

*I\'m sorry,* she thought---to herself, because it wasn\'t really the normal thing for someone in her position to think.

Then she released the singularity, pushing it forward, maintaining her control over it, for now.

*I\'m done here; we need to go,* she thought, as she dashed back out into the main engine room.

The teleporter spread out her teleportation bubble, and a moment later they were back outside the ship again, with the rest of the squadron.

Asami had no time to enjoy the results of her work, or to observe the rear of the cruiser breaking apart in the distance; they were under heavy attack, and already trying to withdraw to safety, which was actually a bit more difficult than charging in, because they no longer had the momentum or surprise that accompanied exiting rapidly from FTL.

The squadron already looked somewhat depleted, and a small number of the MedEvacs hovering in their area were already occupied. Ordinarily, the ships would have rushed back to the nearest friendly cruiser or frigate, but at the moment there was no immediate clear path back to friendly ships---the squadron would have to cut such a path out itself, and the MedEvacs were waiting for an opening.

*Keep it together girls!* Jong Yi thought. *Let\'s make a break for* HSS Abraham Lincoln!

The field of stars in front of Asami flared bright white with the detonation of a hard radiation bomb. She threw up a repulsion barrier, though she didn\'t expect much from it---her gravity‐based powers had the most problems dealing with light. Instead, she drew on her power reserves, summoning another singularity, which she placed in front of her. Forcibly growing it larger again, it absorbed the radiation, as well as a wave of anti‐personnel smart shrapnel that followed, arriving from another explosive.

Turning about‐face, she faced a wave of interceptors that had arrived, the group of girls now too pressed to communicate in more than brief telepathic flashes, carrying nonverbal tidbits of intent or information.

In situations like this, she had very little in the way of a direct attack---she was much more of a support fighter, using her manipulation abilities to alter the trajectories of alien ships, enhance allied maneuverability, or use gravitational anomalies to disrupt alien systems and weaponry.

She tried to maintain her focus in the chaos of the battle, retreating behind defensive barriers erected by the others, directing her attention at perturbing the delicate engine mechanisms of a group of three interceptors passing through her former position. One of the ships dropped out of formation, losing acceleration, and Jong Yi appeared at its side, slamming the ruby tip of her scepter directly into the side of the ship, where it glowed briefly red before blowing the interceptor apart in a blast of crimson light, debris continuing to travel in the ship\'s former direction.

Then, with the kind of telepathic snap that accompanied sudden termination, Jean, one of the barrier generators Asami had been relying on, disappeared, almost literally, her body seeming to vanish utterly in the ultraviolet glare of a laser she had failed to block in time.

The soul gem was still intact, shielded at the last moment by the girl\'s last‐ditch defenses, exactly as stipulated by the combat manual, and Asami grabbed it with a gravitational vortex, hurling it at the nearest empty MedEvac, while simultaneously using a gravitational eddy to divert the course of an alien missile headed towards the area.

She could almost be proud of herself, then, for maintaining her focus, but then with another snap, one of the other barrier generators died, soul gem lost, the still intact upper body seeming to mock her, and forcing her TacComp to suppress the wave of revulsion that passed through her.

Their numbers were dwindling, and the perimeter was breaking down. This was not turning out to be a good run---but at least they were almost at the Lincoln, and the prospect of temporary safety.

Rocketing backward, she dodged and weaved, even turning into a barrel roll, her TacComp working to keep her from being disoriented. Forcing herself into an abrupt deceleration that she could feel damaging her soft tissues, she gritted her teeth and spun her singularity around her, so that the interceptor chasing her rammed directly into it. As the ship distorted and collapsed, breaking into pieces, the world turned bright with radiation again, as an alien cruiser engaged with the Lincoln released a fusillade of hard radiation bombs in their direction. She swung the singularity around to block it, ignoring the remains of the interceptor, but then *another* such bomb detonated behind her, and she knew she had nothing to mitigate the damage this time. Someone else in her squadron would have to cover her back.

But no one got there in time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next few minutes seemed to pass in a blur.

Angry telepathic cursing from Hosna...

Her TacComp announcing her entry into fugue...

The cold, saving embrace of a MedEvac pulling her inside with metal arms...

The distinctly unpleasant sensation of incubation tank fluid entering her lungs...

Then she snapped her eyes up, as if shocked awake.

Her vision was tinted blue by what she knew to be the tank fluid, and various parts of her body itched where she knew various tubes had been inserted. Beyond the tank, there was nothing but the cold inner surface of the MedEvac, which after all was little more than a flying incubation tank with a small stock of grief cubes.

〈*Fugue state anomaly,*〉 the MedEvac thought, robotic voice deliberately warm, but emotionally lifeless. 〈*Soul gem light emission dangerously unstable.*〉

*What am I even doing out here?* she thought, raising her hand to touch her tank wall. *This isn\'t what I wanted.*

Her body hadn\'t been recovered immediately, and had taken substantial damage during the wait. What remained of her hand---the palm, two fingers---was embedded with small, flexible tubes, and covered with bright red sores where flesh had fallen off.

*I can\'t even see the stars,* she thought. *I never wanted to be out here. I wanted to be studying plants!*

Unnoticed, her tears started mingling with the tank fluid.

*But I didn\'t wish for that, did I? I made a wish about my family, when I, I don\'t even---*

*I thought I would want nothing else, but instead, now, I\'d want---*

She pushed herself out onto the local networks, and found to her surprise that she could still access them. That meant they must have made it back. Her attention shifted to a news bulletin:

*Special Audio Announcement to the Fleet by Field Marshal Tomoe Mami:*

\"*Thanks to our hard work and effort, the primary objective of this operation has been completed! The wormhole stabilizers have been destroyed by a special MagOps team assigned to this purpose. With this accomplishment, it may be that victory is in sight. However, this battle is far from over---*\"

She skipped ahead, and then heard the same maternal but authoritative voice continue:

\"*Unfortunately, no victory is without sacrifice, and we have lost all contact with the MagOps team carrying out this operation, and the stealth insertion ship* HSS Raven *has been destroyed. Let us---*\"

Here she heard, or perhaps imagined, a slight emotional tremor on the part of the marshal.

\"*---commemorate those who are missing, while not abandoning hope. The team members are as follows: Colonel Clarisse van Rossum, of Earth---*\"

Feeling her heart shattering inside her, she immediately skipped forward within the audio file, and heard:

\"*Captain Shizuki Ryouko, of Earth---*\"

The remaining two digits of her right hand clenched, gouging the transparent shell around the tank with still intact fingernails. Letting her hand fall away, drifting in the fluid, she began to laugh, harshly, then found she couldn\'t even laugh, that something was damaged.

*All of it, for nothing,* she thought.

〈*Soul gem unstable,*〉 the MedEvac thought. 〈*Emergency measures enacted.*〉

Then, suddenly, so quickly she barely saw it happen, she found herself ejected from the ship, drifting in the cold of interstellar space---or, at least, her body had been. It had kept her soul gem. After all, the quickest way to stabilize a despairing magical girl was to detach her from her body.

She tried to laugh again.

*This madness---*

Then the world blacked out, as the 100‐meter limit rapidly passed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This time, the transition was smooth, giving Ryouko no time to think before a new perspective, a new mind, took dominance of her thoughts. This time, the tenor of the thoughts felt different---efficient and powerful, yet stretched, thin somehow, as if time had worn the mind itself down to bare essentials, as if... something was missing.

She knew immediately who it was, of course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*We\'re actually doing it,* Mami thought. *We\'re holding on.*

She would have reveled in it more, were it not for Erwynmark\'s death. By the time they finally retrieved his body, parts of it were still alive, and they could have regrown it---as an empty shell, since the critical neural circuits in his brain had been irretrievably lost, and unlike her, he had no soul gem as a backup. Information‐theoretic death, the loss of the information that constituted an individual, what the Incubators might call a soul, was the only true death.

It wasn\'t just Erwynmark, of course. There was also the team still on the moon, Clarisse and Ryouko and the others, but those, at least, she still had some hope were still alive.

Try as she might, she couldn\'t suppress the tiny part of her that wasn\'t fully devoted to controlling her fleet, which was once again filling with regret.

*Why do they always die on me? Why can\'t I ever save them? What does it take?*

She shook it off, as she had to, as she had shaken off a thousand such lines of thought over centuries of life. The work---the work was the only thing that mattered, the work that ensured that the greatest good went to the greatest number. Sometimes the few had to suffer. Sometimes it even had to be done deliberately.

She ignored the shiver that passed suddenly through her spine, focusing her attention on the task on hand. Best not to leave parts of her mind thinking idle thoughts.

The ship and troop dispositions of the system spread outward in her mind\'s eye, both literally in front of her and in the depths of her mind, connected to her brain with a directness unachievable by mere vision.

Eschewing the fancy virtual reality travel effects to save processing and time, she inspected the situation as it stood, the scene before her switching instantly to a side‐by‐side view of the twin planets Apollo and Artemis, which appeared as giant orbs in front of her. Despite tremendous pressure from a massive alien offensive, the urban centers of the planets, highlighted before her, were mostly holding on, just barely, despite a few unfortunate antimatter explosives the aliens had managed to slip into the defensive lines, whose damage radii were highlighted bright red on the surface of the planets, resembling painful bloody sores. As for the related casualty counts and environmental damage---that was another thing best not to think about.

As for the two shipyards in orbit around the planets, they were doing... acceptably, according to the consensus of the High Command Gestalt, which forever loomed in the rear---and even forefront---of her mind. The shipyards were taking damage, and Pollux, especially, had been the victim of several insertion teams and bombardments getting through the defenses, but the modular, scattered nature of its design was preventing the damage from being too severe. As long as they survived in some form, the damage could probably be repaired.

But while all that was important, it meant little if the fleet failed in its duties. On that front, things were looking brighter than Mami would have dared hope earlier, and she had no need to go over it all again---it was her responsibility, and even at that very moment, the substantial majority of her focus was devoted to managing the fleets involved.

*Yuma would say that about 75% of my consciousness was involved---no, forget it. I don\'t care.*

With the wormhole stabilizer mission already a success, despite the apparent loss of the team involved, she---more accurately, she and the High Command---had called off the fleets deployed to the diversionary operations, reorganizing and redeploying them to new missions. Admiral Gul\'s fleets, ragged from ferocious combat defending the system\'s human‐controlled asteroids and comets, had been divided between Mami\'s fleet---holding back the alien fleets that had emerged from the wormhole---and Feodorovich\'s counterattack, far beyond the system boundaries. Anand\'s fleets had shown some initial success in their attack on the alien supply lines, but had lost offensive momentum. The system\'s operational reserves had been siphoned off to help with the crisis on Apollo and Artemis, so unfortunately, that was that, and Anand\'s fleets had pulled back, regrouped, and joined Feodorovich\'s massive attack.

Mami switched her focus to Feodorovich\'s fleets, taking a strategic level view of the Euphratic sector, rather than the system‐level view she had gotten used to. Feodorovich at this point had nearly as many ships as Mami did, and for good reason---Mami\'s judgment earlier had proven sound, and the alien\'s salient defenses were stripped bare. With a focused, concentrated strike, of exactly the kind pioneered by human strategists in the earlier parts of the war, the alien rear could be shattered, and without their wormhole, their resources would flag in the face of the industrial might of the human worlds.

Feodorovich was making excellent progress, tearing a deep, narrow swath into the tip of the alien salient into Human space, which was tinted angry red in her field of view. She was bypassing fortified systems, seizing strategic points on shipping lanes, re‐establishing IIC nodes, re‐establishing contact with human garrisons still holding out underground---all the things it took to grab a swathe of space and try to hold onto it. In this case, however, Mami spared herself the details, refusing the flood of information at the edge of her consciousness.

The woman knew what she was doing, and seemed within... distant grasp of achieving their goals.

Mami was now cautiously optimistic, but there was work to be done. The more efficiently they could defend the system, the more ships could be reallocated to Feodorovich. Speed was of the essence, to prevent the aliens reallocating their own forces to stop her drive---and speed required power. Basic military principles.

*Yes, if I focus a little now, I can have this all over with. Just a little longer. Then I can relax.*

The aliens had seemed strangely reluctant to pull back from the offensive, though. It was a tendency human strategists had noted early in the war, and one that could be exploited to profit.

Then, all at once, Mami found her attention seized by a sudden, high‐priority alert.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko again opened her eyes, and this time she found herself back in her own body, standing again on the austere, dark gray surface of the alien moon. She found herself breathing heavily from what she had just experienced. Asami, she---

*She thinks I\'m dead,* Ryouko thought. *I--I\'m---*

She stopped her apology midway, realizing that no one could hear her, and she wasn\'t really sure what she was apologizing for anyway.

*Who was that woman on the shipyard?*

Looking around, thinking that perhaps the vision was over, she found her teammates still motionless, frozen in the same postures she had seen them in at the very beginning.

Then again, with all the temporal anomalies that had formed in the area, it would have been difficult to rule out the possibility, were the Goddess not standing directly in front of her, hands clasped behind her back and watching the sky.

*The Goddess*---it was amazing how mundane the idea was starting to become, in some ways. It didn\'t help that the Goddess in question seemed to be humming to herself, translucent wings twitching in rhythm to a song Ryouko couldn\'t identify.

\"Will she be alright?\" Ryouko asked, finally.

\"Nakihara‐san? Right now, yes, kind of,\" the woman said, in idiomatic Japanese. \"The rest depends on other things. It\'s best not to talk about it.\"

Ryouko stood there for a moment, stymied. She had questions she wanted to ask, all bubbling to the surface of her mind, but something about the Goddess\'s body language dissuaded her from saying anything.

The woman sighed, then spoke in flawless Standard, twirling a part of her long, flowing hair with one finger.

\"Sometimes I show up to these visions in something closer to my human form and personality. It feels refreshing to do that, and sometimes I can almost remember what it was like to be human. But most of the time, I can\'t. It would just confuse the girl receiving the vision. Everyone expects a Goddess to have a certain gravitas, even when the Goddess herself would rather do something else.\"

Still not turning to face Ryouko, the woman seemed to be studying her fingernails.

\"If you think about it, everyone takes on many forms, in the course of a life,\" she said. \"Child, woman, mother. Scientist, writer, leader. Magical girl, goddess, witch. My particular life cycle just happens to stretch over all of time. Sometimes I am excited, cheerful, and young, like I was at the beginning. Other times, I feel old, thin, sort of stretched, like too little butter spread over *way* too much bread. The truth is, when time itself is a meaningless construct, I am all of those things at once.\"

The woman sighed again, then spun around unexpectedly, almost startling Ryouko into jumping.

\"It\'s alright if you don\'t understand,\" she said in Japanese, suddenly smiling. \"I\'m just toying with you. What do you think? Can we be friends?\"

The woman leaned forward, sticking her hand out. Ryouko found herself shaking it, without fully understanding what she was doing. It occurred to her that this version of the goddess seemed palpably younger than the version that had been facing away from her. Did gods age? What did that even mean?

\"Good!\" the woman said, nodding to herself in pleasure. \"Now let\'s get back to business.\"

She tilted her head upward, at the sky, so that Ryouko looked up as well, at the stars distorted by the bubbles of discordant time that floated in the air.

\"My old senpai Mami‐san has refused to give up the fight,\" she said, voice suddenly serious. \"With the destruction of this wormhole stabilizer, she believes she can win this battle, despite the long odds. She and Erwynmark---they believe in the value of staying aggressive, of leaving no one behind, but the currents here run deeper than they know.\"

She looked at Ryouko to make sure she was following, a surprisingly human gesture, then continued, ticking points off on her fingers:

\"Every step of this operation has been designed to lure the human fleet into a deeper and deeper trap. First, the wormhole stabilizer placed at a location that cannot possibly be ignored, with extra stabilizer cores that not only make it more difficult to destroy, but also easier to detect on long‐range sensors. Second, pretending that the stabilizer is not operational, until the human fleet has committed itself too deeply. Finally, moving in reinforcements at an apparent snail\'s pace, and deliberately having surprisingly few forces in the area, leading the human commanders to think that it is still possible to win by being aggressive. In truth, there is a large fleet now gathered around the site of the former wormhole, all gathered within one gigantic cloaking field. This is the first campaign of the war where they\'ve devoted a reasonable amount of resources to trying to win, and that fleet, cloaked on a scale unimaginable to human scientists, is their trump card, their key to finally striking a decisive blow in this war.\"

She stopped, and looked at Ryouko out of the corner of her eye, and a brief pallor seemed to pass over the woman\'s face.

\"Do you understand?\" she asked, voice rigid. \"When that fleet uncloaks and moves out, everyone I just showed you will die. Von Rohr‐san, Nakihara‐san, even Mami‐san. Even if you escaped this moon and warned them, it would already be too late. The die is now cast, and even the destruction of the wormhole stabilizer will save nothing.\"

The Goddess turned, grabbing her by the shoulders, and, in what seemed like a trick of the light, Ryouko found herself looking at a young girl, clad in a pink costume much like hers, as short as she was. Indeed, she would not have seemed out of place as one of Ryouko\'s classmates, back on Earth.

\"Only one thing can save us,\" the girl said, in a voice now much higher‐pitched, almost pleading. \"Magical girls are the only thing that has kept humans alive in this war, and it\'s the only thing the aliens were afraid of. If a trained long‐range clairvoyant had examined the region around the wormhole at the right time, they would have spotted the fleet, even with stealth. If Gracia had looked just a little bit more carefully, instead of focusing only on Raven, she would have seen them. If Nakihara Asami had been assigned to Mami\'s fleet, there is a small chance she would have sensed something wrong. But as it is, everyone was too distracted to look, and no one in command thought to order a closer inspection. They played Mami like a fiddle, and even after four hundred and fifty years, she is still not careful enough. Sometimes, history hinges on collective failures, and little mistakes like that. And the punishment for failure is often very cruel.\"

The girl clasped Ryouko\'s hands in her own, the gesture filling Ryouko with a feeling of familiarity she couldn\'t understand.

\"But, it is easy to manipulate history, if you know how,\" the girl said. \"Even if you have very little direct influence. A suggestion here, a vision there, a well‐timed demon spawn---you don\'t know it, but this is one of the things you were born for. Your wish made sure of it.\"

Ryouko stared back at the girl\'s eyes, those mesmerizing windows into what appeared to be another world, and had no idea what to say. What could* she say, after a speech like that?

She blinked, and suddenly the goddess was an adult again, wearing that white dress.

\"I know you sensed it, before I interrupted you,\" the woman said, pinning her with her gaze. \"With the recent destruction of the wormhole, the fabric of space‐time in this area is very weak. Even without me, you would have realized that your powers are now greatly expanded, but you would have only thought to save your team, and teleport them all back to safety, away from this moon. But, just for now, you are capable of so much more. I\'m not going to play around with confusing symbolism this time. Open the mouth of the wormhole again, then slam it shut on the alien fleet. Send them back home. Then you can teleport out. Do you understand?\"

Again, Ryouko just stared, unable to form a coherent response.

\"Of course you do,\" the Goddess said. \"I can read your mind. You\'ll be fine. Come see me again when this is all over, okay? I expect we\'ll have much to talk about.\"

Then the woman pulled her into a hug, and Ryouko closed her eyes. The hug reminded her, strangely, of her mother.

\"It will be alright, child,\" she heard the Goddess say.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She woke to the sensation of Nadya shaking her violently, trying to wake her as she stood rigidly.

\"I told you, she\'s having a vision,\" Clarisse insisted angrily. "Stop trying to wake her.\"

\"Look, I don\'t want to be mean about this,\" Nadya said, \"but I don\'t believe---we can\'t have people zoning out at a time like this.\"

\"What I would give for a team leader who actually understands the Goddess---\" Gracia began.

\"I don\'t want to hear insubordination at a moment like this---\" Nadya growled.

\"Stop fighting!\" Clarisse said. \"Both of you! That\'s an order. Look, she\'s awake again.\"

Ryouko was aware of how she must have looked, wide‐eyed and shell‐shocked, and what shook her out of her shocked state was, strangely enough, her TacComp.

*Damn it!* the machine thought. *I didn\'t know she was going to end the vision! I was going to ask a question.*

*What question?* Ryouko asked, incredulously.

*It doesn\'t matter. Stop wasting time. Apparently, you have something to do.*

She blinked, and saw that Clarisse had restored order over the rest of the team, which was now looking at her to see what she would say.

She took a breath.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The long‐distance sensor readings should have been impossible---there was no oscillation this time, no orchestrated build‐up. Instead, the area of the wormhole, which had collapsed with a gravitational cacophony that was probably rivaled only by a black hole collision, was stretching again,* with the curvature of local space‐time rising sharply and uninhibitedly.

All at once, sensor blips appeared everywhere in the area of the wormhole---battlecruisers, blink cannons, heavy carriers, ship after ship after ship---enough to blow everything they still had in the system out of the water. Around them appeared, yet again, the mouth of a wormhole.

If it were possible for High Command, the merged AI‐human consciousness of the Human Fleet, to experience complete and utter shock, along with the stirrings of unadulterated panic, then that was what Mami experienced in that moment.

Then, a second later, the wormhole collapsed, and the sensor readings disappeared.

*What on Earth was that?* Mami thought, the incredulity and sheer confusion of the thought mirrored by every battlecruiser and general in the fleet.

In her command chair, with her consciousness buried in the workings of the fleet, Mami could not see what was going on around her, on her bridge, but a moment later the intrusion alarm on the bridge was triggered, and the robotic defense systems went on instant alert. Her bodyguards, Shen Xiao Long and Karina Schei, responded even faster than that, raising a defensive barrier and preparing to attack whatever had just appeared.

\"Don\'t shoot!\" a voice urged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Ryouko had first contracted, using her powers felt natural, completely instinctual, as easy as breathing. Teleportation was patently impossible for an ordinary human, and yet it seemed like no trial at all.

This... well, this was different.

\"I\'m going to reopen the wormhole,\" she had tried to begin, but the combination of expectant, skeptical, and confused faces she had faced had overwhelmed her, and rather than attempt a further explanation, she had turned away, so that she could just *do* it.

But do what, precisely?

She ordered her armor to eject her soul gem, which it did, the gem brilliantly, blindingly green as it extruded from the front of her suit into her hands. Then she raised it upward with both arms, hoping that the fancy gesture would somehow help her.

*Patience, child,* Clarisse\'s voice urged quietly. *Focus. I don\'t know what exactly you\'re trying, but you have to calm down. The gestures will not help. Empty your mind of everything but the magic.*

Ryouko bit back the urge to look at the girl, instead nodding once, slightly. She brought her gem back to her chest, and closed her eyes, trying to do as Clarisse instructed.

*Please,* she thought.

The quiet beating of her heart, continuing its endless cycle in her inhuman chest. The slow rhythm of her breaths, drawing air in and out of the suit\'s pressurized atmosphere. The steady pulsation of her soul gem, in time to a more esoteric rhythm.

*There* it was.

A drumbeat, deep and slow, growing imperceptibly ever‐slower, on a level of reality seemingly removed from all the rest, on the same level that she felt something tearing whenever she teleported. Now that she noticed it, she was astounded that she had ever missed it. The gravitational waves that had emerged from the collapse of the wormhole still ran to and fro over the area, sending shudders through the bubbles of warped reality, ringing like bells around her, and through the patch of space‐time far above them, where the wormhole had been, and which was still weakened from its injury.

Acting on a slowly growing understanding, she prodded at the wound, operating her powers with a level of subtlety she had never before attempted, coaxing the waves around her to come back together and return to order, tugging at and pushing against the bubbles that dotted the world around her like marbles on a stretched sheet, bearing a striking resemblance to the tired general relativity analogy dragged out in every primary school.

At the center above, the chaos grew and grew, so that the already‐damaged fabric of space screamed at the abuse. She felt almost sad, but it had to be done.

For just a moment, she opened her eyes, seeing the world around her cast in green silhouette. Without looking, she knew that the girls behind her were frozen in awe, like photographic stills, some clasping hands in prayer, looking above her at her soul gem, which had floated again above her of its own accord, almost as bright as the sun. Even farther above them, the bright specks of the alien fleet were visible, stealth impossible in the gravitational storm enveloping them. The bubbles that had dotted the world around them had soared upward, were still soaring upward toward their original source.

Then she clenched one hand into a fist, sending it downward at an imaginary barrier, stabbing it with all her strength, and then the sky above her shattered.

It seemed unreal to her, even as she watched it happen, even as she grasped clumsily at the one remaining bubble, the one that still surrounded their group, feeling her power draining and her soul gem dimming.

A soul‐sapping weariness washed over her, so that she could hardly keep her eyes open.

*No! I\'m not done here!* she thought.

As she fell downward, slowly in the weak gravity of the moon, her mind reached outward desperately. She could still find something---

*There!* she thought weakly, as in her mind\'s eye she saw Mami\'s teenage frame, lying back in the chair too large for her, eyes closed.

One last strain---one last effort---

She saw a row of pistols pointed at her team from half the officers on the bridge, and Shen Xiao Long tensing herself to charge.

*That could have gone better,* she thought.

Then the world blacked out.

>
> Details remain scarce on the ground. It seems that the aliens were preparing some sort of trap, involving some sort of massive cloaked fleet sent through a recently‐constructed wormhole, and that this trap was broken by a MagOps insertion team destroying the Wormhole Stabilizer facility. The massive alien fleet was then hurled back through the wormhole. In terms of fleet action, much importance accrues to a counteroffensive by Fleet Admiral Lyubov Feodorovich, which appears to have been a closely‐fought affair. It seems that the alien salient into the Euphratic Sector has been severed, for now at least. It is a feat we have seen repeated several times in this war.

> The MagOps operation involved is the kind of audacious magical intervention we\'ve almost come to expect in this war. *Almost*---my read of the situation is that something else is going on here. A wave of excitement and rumors is spreading among my Cult of Hope sources about some kind of Akemi Homura‐like magical feat. The exact identity of the magical girl involved remains unrevealed, but circumstantial evidence already points to a limited set of possible actors. In particular, the MagOps team apparently involved can be deduced from certain military records, and includes several distinguished members. It seems inevitable that details will eventually emerge, but for now the Armed Forces appear to be deciding how they want to portray events. For now, we can only wait.

However, it is difficult to imagine how exactly she could have leveraged her electrically‐based powers to apply to the given situation.

> Shizuki Ryouko: A relative unknown, she stands out for several reasons: As an almost brand‐new contractee, it was extremely unusual for her to be included in a mission of this scope, as she undeniably was, raising questions of what exactly she was doing there. In addition, she was immediately promoted post‐mission, and awarded the Akemi Homura medal, a medal not given to the rest of the team. 〈Much online attention centers upon her descent from the distinguished Shizuki and Kuroi Matriarchies, although I personally do not consider this particularly important.〉①

> Tensions between the EU and the Russian Federation substantially rose this year over allegations of atrocities committed by the Russian government, with greatly escalating military drone activity on both sides of the Polish border. Continued infighting in the European Parliament threatens to undermine the current government, which has been forced to repeatedly withdraw a proposed resolution condemning Russian atrocities, in the face of staunch non‐interventionist opposition---only increased security has prevented a repeat display of the fisticuffs that broke out during the first such proposal. Observer AIs characterize the situation as dangerously unstable, predicting that, given the escalating protests in key member states, the government will soon be forced to push through its resolution with only a bare majority.

> The US elections this year were chaotic, with protests and riots throughout major East Coast metropolitan areas, despite appeals by the outgoing President Caceres for calm. The collapse of the incumbent Democratic Party, the remaining half of the former two‐party system, surprised all observers, rendering the election an extremely volatile affair. Voter participation varied widely among localities, appearing to hinge heavily on a controversial set of Voter Education Laws passed in numerous states. Such laws had caused supporters of the upstart NWP to allege that the similarly upstart FP was attempting to rig the election in its own favor, and indeed appeared to heavily influence results. Though late‐stage projections had forecast a FP victory, a surge of surprising NWP support gained them the plurality, but not the majority. A bitterly‐divided but newly NWP‐controlled Congress appears set to vote NWP candidates Shelton Mayson and Tu Ling as President and Vice‐President, giving the NWP surprising but probably shaky unified control of the Federal Government, as protests and counter‐protests continue to rock the nation\'s capital.

> Diplomats from major East Asian nations meeting in Mitakihara, Japan, began (and continue) to hammer out details of a proposed \"Asiatic and Pacific Defense Organization\", a military alliance designed to buffer its members against increasing global tensions. This meeting is notable for including China, a nation until now reluctant to participate in what it termed \"lighting fires.\" With tensions along the Siberian border higher than they have been in centuries, it is believed that Chinese leaders now see a benefit in the new security arrangements, which enjoy at least the tacit support of the current US and EU administrations.
>
> Repeated bombardment of Paraguayan military bases has triggered widespread calls for war in Asunción and Buenos Aires, further sabotaging the efforts of Argentinian President Páez to find a diplomatic solution to tensions with Brazil. Urban rioting, EU sanctions, and shockingly violent police reprisals in Brazil have a triggered a wave of refugees fleeing south out of the country, despite military border controls on the Brazilian side. The stories of these refugees have in turn generated significant sympathy and anger in the region, leading to calls from citizens for the army to go North and "clean up the mess.\" Despite Páez\'s efforts, the Paraguayan army is widely reported to be mobilizing, and Argentina\'s western neighbor, Chile, has taken a considerably more hawkish stance, offering Paraguay "unlimited support.\" This support, however, means little without Argentinian assistance, or at least acquiescence. It is believed, however, that the embattled Páez administration will soon abandon its dovish stance, especially now that it has come under diplomatic pressure from the EU. In all this, however, the US presence is conspicuously absent, caught up in domestic affairs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami wasn\'t quite sure she understood the logic of it.

The dream state debriefing---or interrogation---had a long and sordid history. During the Unification Wars, the technique had been used by the UF, FA, and Black Heart on prisoners of all types, seeking to extract valuable information from recalcitrant enemy personnel. In the dreaming state, prisoners were significantly less on their guard, and if necessary, things could be arranged so that they didn\'t realize they were being interrogated at all. One favorite trick had been to instigate a dream of a miraculous rescue, followed by a series of events that would lead the prisoner to divulge critical information, in ways that could often be extremely subtle. After all, if the prisoner happened to take a walk through an important fortification they were intimately familiar with, it was the most natural thing in the world for their brain to fill in the missing details.

Those early interrogations, carried out with crude equipment against soldiers with hostile implants, were less successful than might have been desired, but the technique had the benefit of being relatively gentle, requiring little or no surgery, leaving the prisoner\'s psyche relatively intact, and being unlikely to trigger automated memory wipes or other anti‐interrogation implants.

It was dirty, dirty stuff, the kind of thing Mami would have been happy to leave to Yuma and never learn about, except that it was later adopted by the MHD for a much more benign usage. It turned out that a REM interview, even when carried out as a lucid, consented in‐dream interview, was a fairly good way of tapping deeply into a patient\'s deepest feelings or memories, especially in those circumstances where the patient was incapable of otherwise divulging such information for psychological reasons. It also had the advantage of being much less likely to trigger a despair loop---if recalled memories or events started to influence the soul gem, it was easy to abort by simply waking the patient.

That being said, using it on Shizuki Ryouko struck her as a bit too paranoid.

\"It\'s *precautionary*,\" Atsuko Arisu said, as they stood outside the virtual doorway. \"After a mission and battle like that, we want to make sure there weren\'t other reasons for her soul gem collapse beyond simple exhaustion. Especially since the accounts from the various team members disagree.\"

\"About the, uh, divine intervention?\" Mami asked, biting down the skeptical adjective she was about to add. She remembered that Arisu was sympathetic to Kyouko\'s Cult, even if she wasn\'t a member herself.

\"Among other things,\" Arisu said smoothly. \"In addition, the MHD has noticed a pattern of girls in similar situations being unwilling to share the truth, and your military high command wants to get all the details this time. That\'s easier in these kinds of interviews.\"

Arisu wasn\'t being too subtle about the connotations of her usage of the word \"your\". It stung, a little.

*It\'s not like I want to do this that much,* Mami thought to herself*, but the consensus of Command is that we should, so I\'ll go along with it, for now. I\'m only here to keep an eye on things.*

It was a luxury she could afford now, devoting a meaningful part of her consciousness to something like this. The battle was winding down; Feodorovich\'s offensive had gone successfully, trapping the alien forces in the spearhead in the Kepler‒37 system. As humanity had learned over the course of the war, even the Cephalopods needed their supply lines, and wilted without them. The demands of modern war were stringent.

Mami would have felt better about the accomplishment, were it not for the massive alien fleet that Ryouko had apparently forced back through the wormhole. As humanity had also learned over the course of the war, the squid had reserves and hidden abilities that humans could only dream of.

But then, that was true of Humanity as well.

Besides, it was just an interview, how badly could things go?

Without waiting for her prompting, Arisu opened the door in front of them, which Mami realized with a start was one of the old‐fashioned types, with a doorknob. How hadn\'t she noticed before?

\"The details of these kinds of environments are highly variable,\" Arisu explained, smiling slightly at her confusion. \"You have to remember that ultimately, this world belongs to the dreamer. The rest of us are guests or intruders, depending on how lucid the dream is. Our ability to manipulate is limited, and best kept unused.\"

Which had been, of course, the major downside of dream state interrogation techniques---they depended on the prisoner never realizing they were undergoing the procedure. Once training to resist the technique spread extensively, it became much less effective.

It went without saying that except in the most dire cases, these interviews were done lucidly, out of respect for the patient, which was why they found Ryouko ready for them, sitting in a plush high‐back chair in front of a tall wooden desk, along with a piece of cake she had apparently decided to summon.

She looked both very annoyed and a little... embarrassed?

Upon entering the room, Arisu immediately bowed deeply, in a gesture of apology.

\"I\'m truly sorry about the timing of this. It\'s a precautionary measure, you understand, and we weren\'t careful enough in the dream insertion.\"

\"Yes, well, I suppose it can\'t be helped,\" Ryouko said, still sounding bothered. \"It seems my TacComp has been less than forthright about the content of some of my dreams.\"

\"In my defense,\" Clarisse van Rossum said, materializing in avatar form next to Ryouko, \"it\'s not like you would have wanted to know. And I wasn\'t paying close attention. These things don\'t go into memory storage by default, and, you know, privacy.\"

This version of Clarisse spoke with Ryouko\'s voice instead of Clarisse\'s, but then Ryouko looked queerly at the girl next to her, and it finally dawned on Mami---whispered into her ear by Machina, more precisely---that the avatar wasn\'t Clarisse van Rossum per se, but rather Ryouko\'s TacComp of the same name.

\"Really?\" Ryouko asked skeptically, gesturing at the avatar with her hand. \"This isn\'t confusing at all, I\'m sure.\"

\"What do you want from me?\" Clarisse asked. \"This is the first time I\'ve chosen one of these avatars, and it seemed like the natural choice. Plus, I\'ve got the eye tattoo and everything to distinguish myself.\"

Mami wondered what her face looked like at that moment. It was certainly one of the more novel interviews she had ever experienced. Arisu, on the other, had the serenely unflappable look of a professional.

Seeming to finally remember they were there, Ryouko waved her hands, and three more chairs appeared around the desk, along with a small platter of assorted cookies. As Mami sat, she noted that the cookies appeared to have an Incubator motif.

\"*You have to remember that however lucid she seems, she\'s still not perfectly normal. She\'s probably not taking this as seriously as she should---but on the other hand, it also means she\'s not as tense or anxious. Typical for this kind of interview. They also tend to be a little... quirky.*\"

That thought, from Arisu, was relayed to Mami outside the dream.

\"Anyway, you\'re here to ask about the mission, so ask,\" Ryouko said. "I\'m still not sure why we have to do this; I told you I\'m not under psychological distress. Feed me some grief cubes and I\'ll be fine. I\'m assuming you already did that.\"

\"The military probably thinks it would be easier to try to get information out of you this way,\" Clarisse said, sipping a cup of tea that she had just summoned. \"It seems like just the kind of thing they\'d do.\"

\"You can do that in my dreams?\" Ryouko asked, looking askance at the TacComp.

\"I\'ve never tried until just now,\" Clarisse said. \"Bet you didn\'t know I could taste, either. Well, okay, honestly, I can\'t. But there\'s a way you can simulate---\"

Ryouko interrupted the other girl by waving her hand dismissively.

\"Let\'s get back to the topic,\" she said. \"Well, is it true? Are you here hoping that I\'ll be more talkative now than when I\'m awake?\"

\"Yes,\" Arisu said, before Mami had even finished considering whether she would lie. \"Not in an adversarial manner, of course. If there were anything you really wouldn\'t want to tell us, an interview like this wouldn\'t really achieve anything.\"

\"This seems pointless, then,\" Ryouko said.

Mami couldn\'t help but agree with the sentiment, even if she knew that Arisu was being misleading. Part of the game was to get the patient to accidentally let things slip out, which could be interpreted in the more psychological sense of a patient revealing a truth they had been denying to themselves---or in the much more ethically tenuous sense of taking advantage of someone who wasn\'t fully in control. It was analogous to the obsolete trick of plying someone with alcohol for information.

Mami could reasonably guess, for instance, that Ryouko would never ordinarily call a meeting pointless to the face of the vaunted Field Marshal Tomoe Mami, member of the Mitakihara Four. The honesty was actually a little refreshing.

\"Just bear with it a little,\" Mami said. \"Now, let\'s---\"

\"How\'s the battle going?\" Ryouko asked, looking at Mami seriously.

\"Ah, quite well, actually,\" Mami said. \"Thanks to you, in large part. That\'s actually---\"

\"Good. My access to outside electronics seems to be limited. Anyway, can you tell me anything about Nakihara Asami?\"

The question was directed at Arisu, who had been watching with a slightly amused expression. At the mention of Asami, though, Arisu\'s expression reverted to a professional mask.

\"Why do you ask?\" Arisu asked. \"We\'d be glad to tell you, but---\"

\"Well, I was worried since she---\"

\"Obviously, it\'s natural she\'d be worried about Asami\'s status,\" Clarisse interrupted, her arm almost physically pushing Ryouko away from the table. \"I mean, if we\'re being frank, it\'s not as if there\'s nothing---\"

\"Hey, don\'t just---\" Ryouko began---but then she and her TacComp matched eyes, and some invisible understanding passed between them, probably transmitted outside the dream.

Arisu and Mami met eyes as well. Something had happened just now, they both understood. Clarisse had cut Ryouko off from saying something revealing.

\"*I\'ve never interviewed someone like this with a Version Two TacComp,*\" Arisu relayed. \"*This is going to be more complicated than I thought. The local telepath reports that she somehow seems to know something bad happened to Asami, but can\'t get any deeper than that.*\"

Arisu was still on Earth, but there was an MHD telepath standing next to Ryouko as she slept. Another dirty trick.

Mami, for her own part, had just finished looking up who \"Nakihara Asami\" was. It was in Ryouko\'s personnel file, of course, but Mami generally stayed out of personal business unless she had to. It was interesting, she thought, how many newly‐contracted girls developed relationships so quickly. They needed emotional support, she supposed. She could empathize with that.

*We can probably say something, I think, since she already knows about the clones thing,* Mami thought.

Mami had a visceral distaste for the whole thing which still surfaced whenever it came up, but had learned to swallow it---she had to admit that, if people had listened to her and canceled the whole thing, many girls would be far worse off. She had taken it as a lesson of sorts.

*She knows,* Arisu thought, *but she doesn\'t know that we know. So...*

\"Let\'s discuss that afterward,\" Arisu said. \"For now let\'s focus on the topic at hand, so we don\'t get too distracted.\"

\"I---\" Ryouko began, but stopped, seeming to think better of it.

\"Just describe, in your own words, what happened down on the surface of the moon,\" Arisu said, after waiting a moment. \"Specifically, what happened at the very end, when the wormhole reopened. We don\'t have to talk about the rest of it right now.\"

Ryouko\'s face seemed strangely blank as she regarded the two of them. Mami didn\'t mean that in purely an emotional sense---her face seemed to almost *fluctuate,* becoming briefly a caricature of itself, before returning to normal. It was deeply unsettling, to say the least.

\"What do you know already?\" she asked. \"I\'m sure you\'ve already debriefed my squadmates.\"

\"We know that at the very end, you seemed to have some sort of epiphany, before suddenly performing, let\'s face it, an incredible feat. Accounts differ about what exactly happened. While everyone seems to agree that you zoned out, some members of your team insist that something more, well, religious occurred. We\'d like to hear your version of it, in particular the part no one can explain, which is how exactly you did it.\"

The strange blank look returned. This time, Mami couldn\'t resist asking Arisu what was going on.

\"*Dreams are amorphous things, Mami‐san,*\" Arisu thought. \"*It is only through our intervention that this world is as stable as it seems, but chaos is only just below the surface. In our experience, a true uncontrolled dream appears real only to the dreamer; to anyone else, it looks like madness. In this case, the telepath believes she\'s exerting her control over the dream to deliberately hide her facial expressions---this might be the way it ends up looking to us. She\'s trying to hide something. She doesn\'t intend to lie to our face, though.*\"

Mami performed the mental equivalent of frowning. What, exactly, would Ryouko be trying to hide? It didn\'t match her understanding of her student\'s personality.

\"Well, I can tell you how I did it,\" Ryouko said. \"The fact of the matter is: it turns out my teleportation functions by opening an instantaneous wormhole and pushing me through it. The nature of it also allows me to manipulate pre‐existing wormholes by, for instance, reopening one that has collapsed. In retrospect, I don\'t know why Asami never noticed.\"

There was a moment of silence, as Arisu and Mami chewed on what she had said.

*Manipulates wormholes!* Mami thought. *That could be... useful. More importantly, it might be repeatable.*

It fit with some of the more optimistic guesses Command had made about what had happened. She instructed Machina to pass the information on to parties that might be interested.

\"She probably only saw you teleport in real life a couple of times, at most,\" Arisu said. \"And while I\'m no physicist, I can say that at least on the quantum scale, the distinction between wormholes and quantum teleportation is extremely subtle---it can be argued that there is none.\"

\"If what you say is true, you might know more about the topic than our physicists do,\" Mami commented, prompting a nod from Arisu.

\"Can you elaborate on how you came to suddenly know about your power?\" Arisu asked.

That blank look again.

\"Well, it\'s difficult to explain,\" Ryouko said. \"I guess it can be said I had a vision. I had a vivid flashback to a physics lecture I had had in the past, and suddenly I understood how my power worked. I\'m not sure if that makes sense.\"

\"It\'s not unheard of,\" Arisu said. \"Sometimes this kind of understanding doesn\'t arrive until it\'s needed. It\'s frustrating, but it\'s what it is. I myself didn\'t understand aspects of my power until much later. Is there an explanation you can provide for exactly how you pushed the alien fleet back through the wormhole?\"

Truth be told, Command wasn\'t entirely sure if the alien fleet had really been there the whole time or if it was some kind of illusion or some other effect---it was tough to say with the magic that had apparently gone on. But the presence of a hidden fleet was the most natural explanation, and if it was wrong, they would hear about it right now.

Ryouko shook her head.

\"I\'m not sure I could say anything helpful, at least not without thinking about it some more myself. When the wormhole collapsed, it apparently sent ripples outward into local space‐time, and left a lot of, uh, debris I guess, like the bubbles where we were. I was able to redirect some of the energy back to the origin, enough to reform the wormhole around the alien ships for a brief moment. I\'m not sure why I didn\'t have to go with them. That\'s how my teleportation usually works. Maybe it\'s different when I don\'t open the original wormhole personally.\"

\"It\'s common for girls to find new ways to use their powers, once they understand them better,\" Mami said. \"You\'ll have the chance to work on power development soon, I\'m sure.\"

Arisu nodded.

\"On that topic,\" Mami added, a bit eagerly, \"needless to say, you shattered the teleportation distance record again when you teleported onto *HSS Zhukov*\'s bridge. Is that kind of feat repeatable?\"

\"Maybe,\" Ryouko said, face doubtful. \"I think the extreme space‐time distortions made making a wormhole easier? Though, um, handling the velocity differential only worked because I was separated from the rest of space‐time in that bubble, I think. I\'m not sure how I\'d replicate that.\"

Disappointing, but not surprising. And Science Division would still want to investigate, no doubt.

\"Care to comment on any possible religious aspects to the whole experience?\" Arisu asked.

The blank look returned to Ryouko\'s face, lingering for much longer than it had previously, such that it held even as she started to speak, creating the unsettling impression of a voice emanating from a closed mouth.

\"Why do you ask?\" Ryouko responded, somewhat tersely. Clarisse the TacComp, who had been sitting quietly looking slightly bored, turned her head slightly, seeming suddenly a lot more interested in the topic of conversation.

\"We would like to rectify your account with those of your teammates who insist that there was a religious aspect to what you did. I\'m sure you know some of them are members of the Cult of Hope.\"

\"Is the military interested in the Cult suddenly?\"

\"The military has always been interested in the Cult. After all, the emotional stability they provide is very useful for improving magical girl survival, which is why the military provides the Cult so much logistical support. I myself am here on behalf of the MHD, and we\'re interested for the same reasons.\"

\"What do you think of the Goddess, Atsuko‐san?\"

Mami\'s sense of dissatisfaction grew deeper. She didn\'t need a telepath to tell her that Atsuko had hit on something important, but she had expected Ryouko to dismiss the topic out of hand.

And for a moment Ryouko had seemed to talk of the \"Goddess\" as a fact, rather than a mere belief.

Well... Ryouko had visited Kyouko\'s Cult before she left Earth. Mami had kept enough tabs on her to know that. Perhaps she should look into it a bit more---ask Kyouko, perhaps, though she didn\'t really want to.

Atsuko visibly sighed, making it deliberately obvious.

\"The truth is, Shizuki‐san, while the MHD officially considers the beliefs of the Cult to be a purely religious phenomenon, there is a growing body of evidence that some of the beliefs of the Cult may not be entirely invalid. While we\'re not endorsing a Goddess or anything like that, we would not rule out the possibility of some sort of benign magical influence that helps magical girls on occasions. It would even make sense, from a wish‐based perspective. Among other things, we\'d like to gather information on the phenomena.\"

\"Well, I didn\'t experience anything like that, though the nature of my epiphany makes me wonder.\"

\"*Now this is interesting,*\" Atsuko thought. \"*The telepath can\'t pick up anything at all. We have no idea if she\'s lying or not, which is surprising, because she has no counter‐mind‐reading training.*\"

\"Is there anything else?\" Ryouko asked, after a moment.

\"No, not really,\" Arisu said, shaking her head.

\"Is Asami alright?\"

Arisu looked down for a moment.

\"She suffered from soul gem depletion, and it was necessary to remove her gem from her body. It might take a while to revive her. We might... ask you to be there. I wouldn\'t be telling you this if I weren\'t sure you were psychologically healthy.\"

A gloom seemed to pass over Ryouko\'s face.

\"I know about the clones thing, for the record. Did you manage to keep the original?\"

\"It\'s somewhere in deep space. We\'re looking for the beacon to track it back down, but it might not be possible.\"

Ryouko\'s face tightened, seeming to glare at the psychiatrist.

\"How long?\" Ryouko asked.

\"If we have to regrow it? Maybe two weeks. The preparations have already begun.\"

\"Really?\" Ryouko said, surprised. \"That\'s faster than I expected.\"

\"Well, technology,\" Arisu said, spreading her hands and not elaborating on the somewhat Frankensteinian techniques Mami knew were involved.

Then a moment later:

\"She\'ll be alright, Shizuki‐san. I\'m sure of it. You\'ll see her soon enough. We\'ll let you go back to normal sleep now.\"

Ryouko seemed to smile slightly.

Then, abruptly, she vanished, and the floor dropped out from under Mami, leaving her staring into a twisted, purple void. She gasped, then looked for Arisu, who was standing next to her with a strange look. Then, above her, something headed for them---something large and full of teeth.

Then Mami dropped out of the simulation, the fragment of consciousness released to handle other affairs, briefly taskless. She wouldn\'t have admitted it to anyone, but the apparition had caused her to pull some of her attention away from her command tasks.

\"*I don\'t think she liked us very much,*\" Arisu relayed to Mami. "*Not many people try to drop you in a nightmare before you can exit. She\'ll regret it when she wakes up, of course.*\"

\"*I don\'t think she did, no,*\" Mami responded. \"*I should focus back on my work. I have a lot to think about.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It had all been a bit of a blur. After the rather surreal dream experience, she had been made to undergo another, more traditional debrief, followed by a thorough psychiatric evaluation. Then they told her something she had forgotten to ask her earlier: her grandfather was alive and well. She felt a little embarrassed about not having asked.

As they questioned her, she checked the status of the battle outside. As Mami had said, it was going well, thanks to her. The aliens had been caught flat‐footed yet again. A deity had intervened, and she had been the instrument.

But Clarisse---the real Clarisse---had told her not to talk about that, somehow relaying the message telepathically to her while she slept, just before the start of the dream‐debrief. While she had personally been too asleep---and distracted---to notice, her TacComp had picked up the message and informed her later. It had been... strange.

After the interviews, Clarisse herself showed up to escort her back to the rest of the team.

*Was it really the right thing to do, not telling them?* Ryouko thought, as they headed out of the room.

*It\'s for your own sake,* Clarisse thought. *You\'re a hero now. If you start saying that your actions were due to a vision from the Goddess, you will become indelibly tied to the Church, in the eyes of the public. I do not think you would want that.*

*I know; you told me that already. It just feels---*

*Deceitful? Much of the world is founded on deceit. Such has it always been. Otherwise I wouldn\'t have* this *with me.*

Clarisse reached upward, pushing apart her hair to reveal a small hairpin buried within. It looked like an ordinary gold hairpin, but now that it had been pointed out, something about it seemed to draw her attention---

*It\'s emanating magic!* she thought, in surprise.

*It\'s an artifact, like the suits we were wearing earlier,* Clarisse thought. *It protects against mind‐reading and mind‐control effects. I\'m sure you noticed the mind‐readers in your debriefings. I didn\'t want them listening too carefully. Don\'t ask me how I got it.*

Then Clarisse dropped her hand, letting her hair fall back down.

Ryouko stayed silent for a moment. Clarisse had turned out... not as she had expected. More real, more human, and much less idealistic. In a way, though, she almost preferred this.

*Can I ask a question?* she asked.

*Yes?*

*What\'s your opinion of the Goddess?*

Clarisse slowed to a stop, then turned to face her.

*What precisely do you mean?* the Ancient asked, head tilted.

*What--what kind of person do you think she is, I guess?* Ryouko asked, a bit flummoxed by the sudden intensity of Clarisse\'s look.

Clarisse turned back around and started walking again.

*Person. Funny that you should put it that way. Well, she\'s definitely got a good heart. I can honestly say that I think that there\'s no one else more suited to be what she is. At the same time, with the kind of knowledge and good intentions she has, it---well, I guess the way to put it is that not even the most kind‐hearted king can avoid rolling a few heads here and there.*

Again, Ryouko stayed silent, trying to think of what to say to that.

*Not what you expected?* Clarisse thought. *The world is not as nice as you might think it is, aliens or not. You\'ll need to remember that in the future.*

Then, suddenly, they were there, the door opening to a recreation area located near the medical bay, deliberately set close enough that it wasn\'t necessary to take the tubes.

The conversation in the room fell silent as they entered, and for a moment the rest of the team and Ryouko stared at each other.

\"Well, good to see you\'re okay,\" Nadya said, finally. \"That was quite a stunt you pulled. I didn\'t expect anyone to one‐up Misa.\"

\"Well, uh, I didn\'t have to, you know, lose---\" Ryouko started, walking over to sit on one of the open lounge chairs near Zheng Ying‐zhi. Unlike Asami, she had had an extra body directly on hand, and could be revived relatively quickly---though Ryouko wondered what was taking so long with Misa.

She had cut herself off, though, because she didn\'t think talking about the bodyloss was a good idea.

\"Yeah, it\'s a shame,\" Annabelle said. \"But really I miss Juliet and the others. Things just aren\'t the same here without her and her, uh, silence.\"

The joke fell completely flat, as expected, as the others stared back blankly.

\"Ah, Misa would laugh uproariously at that,\" Nadya said, before things could get too awkward.

\"She\'s a strange one,\" Annabelle said. \"Refuses to wave her arms dramatically to use her powers, but loves making a spectacle. Did you ever get out of her just what happened on New California?\"

\"No,\" Nadya said. \"Which must mean it was something really serious, because she\'s not usually all that tight‐lipped.\"

\"We were there with her,\" Mina commented, referring to her and Gracia, "and even we don\'t know what happened. Juliet never found out either. Well, so far as I know...\"

\"What exactly are we talking about here?\" Clarisse asked. \"I admit: this isn\'t something I\'ve heard about.\"

Ying‐zhi drew Ryouko\'s attention away from the conversation, tapping her on the arm. Their eyes met, and for a moment Ryouko wondered what it was like to inhabit a new body like that. It didn\'t seem to bother her, but...

*Don\'t worry,* Ying‐zhi thought, nodding her head at the rest of the room, *they\'re dying to ask you about what you did out there. They\'re just giving you space to breathe by chewing the cud a little first.*

*Ah, yes,* Ryouko said, blinking at the strange idiom, which she had had to hastily look up. *How did you know I was wondering about that?*

*That\'s what I\'d be thinking about,* Ying‐zhi explained. *But, in any case, I\'m not surprised. Not with your family background.*

The other girl gestured at Ryouko\'s bracelet and necklace, the visible jewelry she wore signaling her relationship to Shizuki Sayaka and Kuroi Kana. Ryouko self‐consciously covered the bracelet with one hand---she had forgotten it was there.

*Not many people nowadays know what those mean, but Nadya did. And of course, we all knew your background before you joined the team. That kind of background can be a blessing and a curse. A blessing, because you probably* are *powerful, and those connections open doors for you even besides that. A curse, because some will expect more from you, and others will think of you as an entitled brat.*

Ryouko furrowed her brow at the comment.

*A brat? But---*

*It\'s just what some people might think; not the truth. Listen, soon enough the media will find out what happened here, and that\'s when it will all begin. And when it does, the MSY sources will all be sure to mention who you\'re descended from. You won\'t be able to escape it. Even beyond that---maybe you\'ve already experienced a little of this---the two families will start stabbing each other in the back to try and claim you, and a bunch of other families will start sending people to try and marry you. You\'re young; I don\'t know if you\'re ready for it. You\'ve got to have thick skin. Ah, you\'ve already experienced it.*

That last sentence was in response to the look that passed over Ryouko\'s face, remembering her \"suitors\", which she had up until now completely forgotten about.

*By the way, I now have ten more letters from prospective suitors,* her TacComp thought, privately.

*Hush,* Ryouko ordered, knowing full well the device was making fun of her.

*And this girl you might be involved with,* Ying‐zhi continued. Nakihara Asami. There\'s a good chance your illustrious ancestors will not like her. She has no lineage to speak of. I\'m just warning you.*

The girl pinned Ryouko with an intense look, so that she felt compelled to nod in understanding.

*I\'ve been down that road,* Ying‐zhi thought. *It\'s not very fun. I just want you to be more ready than I was. If you ever want advice, feel free to message me.*

Again, Ryouko nodded awkwardly. Like Eva, Zheng Ying‐zhi had not been one of the team members Ryouko would have said she was close with, but apparently something about Ryouko struck a chord with her.

Then she thought of something.

*Wait, does everyone here know about Asami? Was it in the files?*

*Yes, everything is in the files,* Ying‐zhi thought. *That\'s something else you should get used to.*

\"Scaring the new girl with your anecdotes?\" Nadya asked, appearing next to the two of them, causing Ryouko to startle slightly.

\"I\'m just telling her the truth,\" Ying‐zhi said.

Nadya shook her head, then gave Ryouko a sympathetic look.

\"Ying‐zhi here is a little traumatized. You shouldn\'t mind her. Anyway, we\'re going to have the synthesizer make some snacks, do you have anything in particular you want?\"

\"Coffee,\" Ying‐zhi said.

\"Strawberry cream cake,\" Ryouko said, realizing abruptly just how long it had been since she had had any.

As Nadya walked back to the synthesizer, where the others were now standing clustered, Ryouko sat and pondered what Ying‐zhi had said. Her life was about to get a lot more complicated, wasn\'t it?

But then Gracia and Mina walked towards her, a certain gleam in their eyes, and Ryouko braced herself for a round of questioning on the Goddess and the nature of visions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*What have I gotten myself into?* Ryouko thought.

Some part of her had looked forward to the end of her previous rotation. She could ask for leave, that part had thought. Surely it was justified after that last mission. At the very least, she could receive a more relaxing rotation, perhaps stationed in some exotic colony world somewhere, and go exploring. At the very least, maybe she could see what being a staff officer was like.

The other part of her was, quite possibly, crazy, and wanted her to instead find a new assignment, one that was just as exciting. Maybe she could swing a permanent MagOps assignment.

Neither part had had their expectations fulfilled.

Instead, the days afterward had been filled by, for lack of a better word, *ceremony.* First had come the interview requests---just a trickle---from reporters curious to hear from a member of the "Wormhole‐destroying\" MagOps team.

Then had come the hybrid virtual/physical press conference, and she had never seen so many reporters and bloggers and assorted media personalities in one place, appearing like a sea of faces in front of her. Mami had coached her, and did most of the talking, but the usually shy and reclusive Ryouko couldn\'t help but blanch just standing there in the background, even hidden among the rest of the team.

When she was finally introduced to the audience, with a sea of NIM lenses pointed at her, it took an uncomfortable amount of implant intervention to keep her from stammering while saying her lines and answering a few, prescreened questions.

After that, there had been the medal ceremony, another media‐filled event, completely unlike the more intimate, three‐person ceremony that had accompanied her previous decoration. Where the previous ceremony had been informal, this one was stiff and regimented. Where it had been simple, this one was pompous and ornate.

Now she found herself seated in her quarters on the Zhukov, flipping through a sheaf of new messages. Interview requests, fan mail and---this was new---requests from various physicists for her to pay a visit, maybe even participate in a study or two.

It was hectic, and no less than a little exhausting, but if she were honest with herself, part of her enjoyed it.

It was probably the same part that had wanted her to go right back into the field, performing more high‐risk MagOps assignments. She wasn\'t sure if she should listen to it.

*Am I crazy, Clarisse?* she asked her TacComp.

*I wouldn\'t say so,* the device thought. *After all, if you had wanted a safe life, you could have just stayed home. But then I doubt you would have ever met any Incubators.*

Ryouko paused for a moment.

*I--I guess I know that. I don\'t know what to think right now.*

*Let\'s leave the subject,* Clarisse thought. *You don\'t have time to respond to any of these anyway. At least not now. If I have this right, right now the plan is to call your parents again, decide to put it off, and then spend some time worrying about Asami even though you can\'t do anything about it. And then you\'ll consider responding to all these letters from suitors that you keep getting. Then you\'ll decide that you need to go ask someone for advice about it, even though four separate people---Ying‐zhi, Clarisse, Nadya, and Mami---have told you that you shouldn\'t keep ignoring it. Maybe this time you should ask Kyouko. She might tell you what you want to hear.*

*I see that sarcasm module got substantial upgrades in Version Two*, Ryouko responded sardonically.

*Only with genes inherited from the very best,* Clarisse replied, in the exact same tone of voice. *Seriously, though, why do you even keep me around if you\'re going to ignore my reminders? You know I\'m right.*

Ryouko sighed.

*I know,* she thought. *I just... don\'t...*

The truth was, she *had* bit the bullet and called one person already. She had called her grandfather, because she felt she had to, but even though neither of them did or said anything wrong, the conversation had been so uncomfortable, the sudden gap between them so wide and visceral, that it had paralyzed her ability to repeat the action.

Her grandmother was dead, the woman she barely knew, and the difference between their reactions to the events was such that they might as well have lived in different worlds. He was devastated, and she had no idea what to say.

She\'d gotten the notice shortly after the battle ended. It seemed her grandmother had been killed defending a cruiser production facility from an alien insertion team. The news had seemed to hang in the air for a moment, before her TacComp had gently reminded her of the circumstances of one of her visions, the one with the unidentified captain killed defending the Pollux shipyard. The details matched up exactly.

She considered the box of memorabilia on the bed next to her. There wasn\'t really much in it; a few favored clothing items---including those bunny slippers she\'d had for ages---and a disassembled telescope, the body of which she was holding in her lap.

Why had the Goddess bothered to show her a vision like that? What point was there to it? The more she thought about it, the more it bothered her. The first two visions, the one with her grandmother and the one with Patricia and Maki, seemed to have had no direct bearing on the situation. Was the Goddess just being verbose for no reason?

What bothered her the most, of course, was the simple lack of emotion she felt. Yes, she had known her grandmother well as a child, but that had been a long time ago. In truth, she realized, she hardly knew the woman at all, and couldn\'t really summon more than an abstract kind of sorrow.

If she had just lived a little longer, Ryouko could have easily visited, as she had her grandfather. It bothered her more than she cared to admit.

She flipped through her calendar, calling up a visual of her upcoming schedule in front of her.

The logic was simple: memorial services took some time to arrange, but not *that* long. About one and a half weeks, with the scale of the effort proportional to the importance of the person who was dead, and some considerations made for timeliness---there had to be time for anyone invited to cross interstellar space, if required.

Thus, simple logistic considerations had contrived to place her in no less than three consecutive memorial services. The first would be on ship, arranged by the MagOps team for Eva, Juliet, and the ship and its crew. Then they would depart the Zhukov by fast transport, and attend the state funeral for Roland Erwynmark, on his home planet of Bismarck---Mami was too busy to attend in physical person, so it was imperative that the team and the newly styled \"Hero of Orpheus\" show up. Then, finally, she would take leave and head back to Earth, be there while they woke Asami\'s clone, then attend the funeral for her grandmother, which her parents were already setting up.

It felt tiring just to think about.

Sighing, she placed the telescope back in the box, closing the lid. Three funerals, for people she in truth didn\'t know very well. It wasn\'t that she felt the time wasted---instead, she regretted not knowing them better.

Ryouko stood up, shook her head at herself, and headed out the door. It was time for the first service.

The memorial service was a simple affair, more an informal gathering than anything. It wasn\'t intended to replace any funerals the families of the people involved might want to hold. It was, she supposed, just a remembrance, hurriedly arranged and deliberately low‐key.

She felt awkward approaching the room where it was being held. In truth, like most people from Earth, she had never been to a memorial service. There were none to go to, when no one died. From what she had read online, it seemed these kinds of group remembrances were often conducted as generically as possible, trying to split the difference between more traditional elaborate somber gatherings, stoic colonial‐style services, defiant Unification Wars‐style mass feasts---food had been a big deal at the time---and probably most importantly, Cult of Hope‐style funeral parties.*

At least the neo‐Roman fad that had been briefly popular---complete with masks, mimes, and dancers---seemed to have been just that: a fad.

She had been told to expect a restrained affair---no speeches, nothing religious, no alcohol, and definitely no *dancers.* There would be a place to pay your respects, and a table of snacks, an apparent concession to the more celebratory style of funeral.

The invitation had also specified that she was supposed to come in casual attire, so she didn\'t have a chance to be confused about that.

Sometimes she wished doors would stay closed until you opened them, instead of trying to anticipate your arrival. Sure, you could turn that off, but going out of your way to do that could be considered a statement.

Turning the corner into the room, she almost stopped dead.

It took her a moment to recover, long enough that her TacComp would probably have nudged her had she spent any longer standing there slack‐jawed.

\"Oh, hello,\" *HSS Raven* said, noting Ryouko\'s appearance in the doorway. \"Glad you could make it.\"

\"They\'re still working on building a new body for her,\" Nadya said, noting Ryouko\'s moment of confusion. \"It has to be done carefully, you know, since she\'s not a new AI. She\'s stopped by for this. It\'s AI tradition, though I guess it is kind of weird.\"

The last sentence was clearly spoken for Ryouko\'s benefit, since she had completely failed to anticipate this.

\"I always wondered what it would be like to attend my own funeral,\" HSS Raven* said, still dressed in her customary naval captain uniform. "I guess I\'m finding out. Or maybe I was born last week, and these memories are just fooling me into thinking I\'m the same ship. Can\'t think too much about that.\"

\"Well, I guess I\'m glad to see you up and... about,\" Ryouko managed, feeling proud of herself for not stammering.

\"Have some food,\" *HSS Raven* suggested. \"I\'m told Nadya makes excellent hors d\'oeuvres. Never seemed to match my image of her, that.\"

\"You live long enough, you learn everything,\" Nadya said sourly. \"And Juliet was the better cook, by far.\"

Ryouko shuffled past them, thinking to herself that AIs just might be irredeemably weird, at least if Raven and Clarisse were any indication.

This was one of the ship\'s observation decks, chosen for this occasion. Against a panoramic backdrop of the stars outside---simulated during FTL transit---it featured a long table full of food, various small clusters of people seated or standing, a large central table with static holograms of the deceased. The event was only sparsely attended, featuring the remaining team members and what few friends and family members could travel to the ship on such short notice. Tomoe Mami had been invited to attend, but couldn\'t make it.

She shimmied up to the food table, squinting skeptically at one of the carefully arranged platters of food. Native Samsaran Effictian Rock Pigeon, nanite‐preserved fresh from the slaughterhouse, on tiny individualized leaves from Nova Terra. The leaves were the same fuzzy blood‐red leaves she had had at that lunch where she met Asami, what seemed like a lifetime ago, but what really made her skeptical was the meat, which was a distinctly plant‐like shade of green, and served raw, slathered in bright blue \"Gleeb\" salsa.

It looked more like a dessert than anything.

Swallowing slightly, she picked up a small plate and gingerly picked up a piece with the provided utensil. No sense in wanting to be a brave explorer and being squeamish about the food, after all. Besides, what would Asami say? And it smelled pretty good...

She sighed. That vision with Asami still ate at her, and she couldn\'t help feeling a certain sense of guilt. She knew there was nothing she could do but wait for the week or so until she received the notification that Asami\'s body was rebuilt---she had already asked to be present when she was revived---but she couldn\'t help feeling a certain restlessness.

Then something toggled in her mind, and she glanced to her right, at the table where the photographs had been set up. There she found a girl, about the same physical age, leaning on the table for support, seeming to be in throes of emotion, though not sobbing. Next to her stood an awkward‐looking Gracia, who was waving at Ryouko to come over. As Ryouko watched, glancing around for Nadya or Clarisse or *someone* to come bail her out, Gracia telepathically pinged her again.

*Get over here already!* Gracia insisted.

*Why are you asking me for help? Do I look like I\'m two hundred years old?* Ryouko asked, reluctantly walking over, still looking around for some of the others---Nadya was still at the door, Clarisse was in a far corner.

*No one else is available!* Gracia insisted. *I\'m not good at this! She doesn\'t believe in the Goddess! I don\'t know what to say!*

*I\'m not good at this either!*

But as Ryouko got to the table, the crying girl seemed to collect herself, a little, backing away slightly.

*I\'m sorry; I\'m fine,* the girl sent telepathically. *I thought I\'d be okay, but I\'m fine now.*

The telepathy surprised Ryouko. Her eyes flashed to the girl\'s hand, which carried the distinctive ring and fingernail mark---a spiderweb, it looked like---then to the framed portrait of Juliet François in front of her, then to the girl\'s face.

*Marianne François,* the girl thought, intercepting Ryouko before the facescan could complete. *Don\'t believe the face thing; it\'s not right. I\'m her mother.* Was *her mother, I guess.*

The girl sniffled slightly, wiping at her face with a handkerchief.

Ryouko took a moment to glare daggers at Gracia, who was sneaking away.

*I see,* she thought. *I---well, nice to meet you, I suppose. I can\'t say Juliet ever really said anything about you, but we don\'t really talk about our families much.*

Privately, Ryouko registered that she was dealing with another member of the Black Heart, given the \"incorrect\" face‐scan, which was indeed showing someone named \"Michelle Sylvie\". But, a mother---Ryouko wasn\'t used to thinking of someone who appeared so young as a mother, despite having met several such girls before. It occurred to her, suddenly, that she had no idea if anyone else on the MagOps team had children. The topic had never come up.

*She was a nice girl,* Ryouko continued, a bit helplessly. *I\'m sorry for---*

*She didn\'t listen to me!* Marianne snapped back. *I told her she shouldn\'t be going into the field! I told her to stick to analysis work! Now look what happened!*

*Uh---*

Suddenly the girl seemed to lose her composure again.

*I haven\'t spoken to her in years. If she had just listened to me! I knew she was going but I--I stopped interfering with her life---I thought---Maybe if I had just talked to Mami...*

The girl\'s shoulders slumped, and she suddenly looked much, much older.

*You know Mami?* Ryouko asked, surprised, looking for something else to talk about, to break the awkward silence.

*I\'m her chief intelligence officer,* Marianne thought. *I never even told her I had a daughter. It\'s all my fault. If I had just been able to find a boy she liked...*

*No, don\'t say that, it\'s not your fault,* Ryouko interjected hastily. She loved her job and, uh...*

At a sudden loss for words, Ryouko bit into her hors d\'oeuvre, trying to buy time.

*This is delicious,* she thought, taken aback, knowing the thought to be completely inappropriate for the situation. *I didn\'t think---*

\"Military personnel love it,\" Nadya said, appearing next to the two them. \"Civilians, not so much. Apparently the modified olfactory sense makes raw meat taste better.\"

Ryouko made eye contact with Nadya. She had no idea what Nadya was seeing in her eyes, but would have guessed that it was some variation of "Please! Save me!\"

\"Ma\'am,\" Nadya said, shifting her position subtly so that it was clear she was taking over the conversation. \"I know you miss her. We miss her too. Wouldn\'t it be better to---\"

Instead of saying anything coherent, Marianne just grabbed the other girl and pulled her into a hug, sobbing onto her shoulder. Looking nonplussed, Nadya patted her on the head.

Feeling decidedly unheroic, Ryouko backed rapidly out of the area, taking comfort from the fact that at least Nadya was *old.* That would probably help, right?

*I can\'t imagine what it\'d be like, to care so much that someone is gone,* Ryouko thought.

*You\'re not thinking clearly,* her TacComp said, with surprising alacrity. *How concerned were you about Asami? How would you feel if she were dead? What about your grandfather?*

The question stopped Ryouko cold, and she stopped there for a long moment, watching the surreal scene in front of her, as Clarisse and Nadya hovered over Marianne in front of the memorial table.

*You\'re right,* she thought finally. *I wasn\'t thinking. But... I don\'t know. I can\'t---*

Then she stopped, shook her head at herself, and headed back towards the food table. She hadn\'t been thinking, but she wasn\'t sure she wanted to think.

She could tell the question would bug her, though.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami was looking forward to a vacation.

The last few weeks had been undeniably exhausting, but she had persevered, painful as it was. The nightmares were getting worse, and her bodyguards were pushing her to see an MHD shrink, maybe get them looked at---and maybe she would, if she had some time. Centuries of life had taught her not to be proud enough to try to deal with everything herself, though sometimes you just had to, if you had work to do. She liked to think she was capable of that, now, that she wasn\'t as fragile as she had been, all those years ago.

Speaking of that, maybe it was time to pay another visit to Kyouko. There was a time, long ago, when she had thought the two of them might be something. That had been---let\'s see---not when they first met, though, thinking back, it might have started then. It had been after they reunited, when Kyouko had picked her back up after Oriko had trashed her life.

She had realized, then, that objectively Kyouko\'s problems had been far worse than hers---and yet it was Kyouko helping her, not the other way around. She had perceived a strength of character that she herself lacked, one that would never try to self‐destruct, as she had against Oriko. Yet even then, she could see that Kyouko was suffering, as she had suffered while alone. She had done her best to rectify that.

For a while, then, she had thought she was in love.

She hadn\'t been, of course. She had grown to realize that. Love, at least of the romantic sort, was something else entirely, something she now thought herself unsuited for. Instead, she had admired Kyouko, even after the girl had broken her own heart chasing after Sayaka.

She missed those days, living with the other three. After they founded the MSY, after they had gotten their own apartments and gone their own separate ways, she had tried to recreate it again, inviting her new pupils in to live with her, and even with some of them, she had considered...

But in the end, she could never recapture the spirit. It was too ephemeral, too dependent on circumstances that would never recur---on friends that had struggled together, on friends who were young and not yet worn out by the long centuries, on friends who didn\'t have other things to do.

If only Kyouko hadn\'t developed that fascination with that Cult of hers. They could have been officers together, at least. She wouldn\'t be so alone out here, and so, so tired.

*I\'m sorry to disturb you,* Machina said, *but I really think you should be paying more attention to this.*

*Ah yes, of course. Sorry.*

She realized that she had been gripping the armrests of her virtual chair, digging her fingernails into the cushion. Thankfully, Machina had helped her keep an impassive expression.

She performed the mental equivalent of sighing. An important meeting of the General Staff, to decide Erwynmark\'s successor, and she couldn\'t resist the temptation to zone out, diverting parts of her consciousness to idle musing. It was as if she had spent herself on the previous campaign.

To be fair, she had also found herself unusually affected by Roland\'s death. This meeting, the idea of being here on the General Staff, seemed even less palatable than usual.

She found herself staring at *Governance: Military Affairs,* the temporary chair of the meeting. A stern‐looking, vaguely European‐looking man, he was actually a full AI Representative embodying everyone\'s stereotype of the military, wearing a dress uniform that was almost authentic. His right arm was encased in a slimmed‐down version of an infantry armored suit, which still caused him to look almost comically disproportionate; this kind of thing was typical for the AI representatives of the Directorate, though.

Much to his chagrin, Military Affairs had yet to find a way to incorporate a magical girl motif into his appearance in a way that he was comfortable with---thus far, he had settled for a decal printed on his armor, depicting a magical girl about to attack. It had once been much more suggestively posed, based on \"historical military tradition\", but Yuma had managed to stir up enough of a controversy about the image to force him to change it.

Shaking her head at her own lack of focus, Mami took a moment to review what had happened in the meeting while she was daydreaming---implants did have their advantages, after all, and *most* of her had been paying attention. She replayed the audio in her mind:

\"The chair of the General Staff should be someone with experience, and a long history of successful leadership, in *multiple* campaigns,\" Field Marshal Sualem said. \"Only then can we be sure that their previous success cannot be attributed to luck. Marshal Porto would be an excellent candidate.\"

Marshal Porto himself snorted.

\"Let me tell you,\" the Unification Wars veteran said, \"luck is on the side of every successful general. Napoleon, for instance, was famously lucky.\"

\"And also famously talented,\" Sualem said. \"Your campaigns in South America are masterpieces.\"

\"And irrelevant to the current war,\" Porto said. \"I must graciously decline.\"

\"Stop being fatuous, Sualem,\" Fleet Admiral Anand said, voice seeming almost to purr. \"Erwynmark himself assumed the chair based on only a few victories.\"

\"He also showed brilliance,\" Sualem argued. \"Something which was conspicuously missing from this recent campaign.\"

\"Erwynmark himself helped design the campaign, in case you forget,\" Feodorovich said, voice stern. \"The decisions of the previous campaign were well‐reviewed by the Staff.\"

\"We won by luck,\" Sualem insisted. \"Because a single girl just happened*---\"

\"Excuse me,\" Mami interjected, leaning forward, now that she had caught up with real‐time. \"It was *not* luck. I resent the implication. Luck played a factor, but this kind of \'luck\'---\"

Here she made an \"air quotes\" gesture with both hands, a gesture that had surprisingly survived nearly five centuries of usage.

\"---is always relevant to MagOps operations. Operatives are expected to use creativity, as well as their special capabilities. Previous operations have also achieved success in unexpected ways such as this.\"

\"*Not* on the scale---\"

Military Affairs cleared his throat loudly, drawing their attention.

\"While of course demonstrated ability is an important, perhaps the primary, consideration, it must be that other considerations also play a role. Accomplishments now are more important than accomplishments in the past, which may no longer be relevant to the current nature of the war. While retrospective analysis will of course continue for a while, the execution of the recent campaign appears to have been more than adequate, even if in the end it required \'luck\'. In the end, it may be that in this war, expecting to win without luck is misguided.\"

The AI spoke in a level, baritone voice, taking a moment to meet each of them in turn with his eyes---or rather, eye, since one eye was tattooed with the AI‐style \"I/O\".

Mami frowned. She had expected Sualem to be his usual annoying self, so his taking the opportunity to denigrate her achievements came as no surprise, but on those occasions when he attended these meetings, Military Affairs generally preferred to stay silent, allowing the Staff to operate as they would. Sure, it was not every day that the Chair of the General Staff needed to be replaced, but she remembered well Erwynmark\'s ascendancy to the position nearly a decade ago, where Military Affairs had simply sat silently until it was time to vote.

\"And of course, there\'s always politics,\" the AI continued, finally. "The Directorate continues to express dissatisfaction with the composition of this Staff, which is, let us admit, less than meritocratic. While this is of course not a meeting to discuss new additions to the General Staff, there is an obvious choice for Chair that would also serve to illustrate our commitment to promotion based on demonstrated achievement.\"

Mami blinked, taking a moment to parse the almost‐oracular pronouncement.

Once, long ago, she would have jumped up in open surprise at what was being suggested. Centuries of work as the MSY\'s chief diplomat, then later as a Field Marshal on the General Staff, allowed her to express only an appropriate mild surprise.

*Of course!* she realized. *Why didn\'t I see it sooner? I\'m supposed to be good at this sort of thing!*

Sualem, Anand, Porto---they had realized long before her. The entire discussion up until now had been conversational maneuvering, designed to make their points without having to say anything explicitly.

*You were distracted,* Machina pointed out, breaking her TacComp\'s customary silence. *And, I would add, you seemed to have had a strong bias against thinking about yourself in that role. I know you have a lot of experience, but my analysis of your memories indicates that this is not the first time you have been blindsided by something you should have expected.*

*You\'re criticizing me?* Mami asked, in surprise. It wasn\'t Machina\'s style to say something like that.

*Well, I...* her TacComp began, before seeming to let the sentence trail off.

*Nevermind, I suppose,* Machina thought.

Mami decided to worry about her TacComp\'s strange behavior later. Fortunately, their conversation had taken place in accelerated time, allowing Mami to still respond to Military Affairs in real‐time.

\"Excuse me,\" she asked, deciding that it was probably time to throw down the gauntlet. \"Is it your intention to nominate *me* for the position of Chair of the General Staff?\"

She kept her face mildly surprised, perhaps pleased, but a storm of emotions roiled underneath the surface.

*Me? Chair? I hadn\'t even thought to campaign for it. But he\'s right, after what just happened---I\'m the obvious choice.*

\"I am expressing my support,\" Military Affairs said. \"It was Erwynmark\'s wish that I nominate you in case of his demise, a wish that I agreed with. Of course, if the Staff decide otherwise, that is their prerogative.\"

That was not strictly true. Military Affairs, and above him, the Directorate as a whole, technically had the power to appoint the Chair directly, or to fire and replace the whole Staff at their whim. But, it was, of course, against tradition for civilian Governance to exercise its power directly.

*I have to accept,* Mami thought. *I\'m the representative for all magical girls on this Staff. It\'s an unprecedented honor.*

\"It is an honor,\" she said.

The comments by Military Affairs had brought the situation out into the open, triggering a cascade of looks, glances, and glares around the room, as each member of the Staff tried to assess the others, gauging their positions. Mami did the same.

*It looks like about fifteen out of twenty‐three,* Machina commented. The endorsement of Military Affairs and Erwynmark seems to have provided a real boost of support.*

\"Perhaps we may as well hold the vote now,\" Military Affairs said. "Does anyone object? Perhaps any more nominations?\"

Mami could see the anger on Sualem\'s face, and could take pleasure in at least that much. For a moment she thought the man would nominate someone else, even himself, in a quixotic lost cause, but in the end he subsided, even though he looked almost apoplectic. The influence of tradition on the General Staff was strong, and it would have been unprecedented for there to be more than one nominee---the Staff never nominated anyone until it was sure.

Military Affairs cleared his throat again, theatrically.

\"Then on the motion to elect Field Marshal Tomoe Mami as the new Chair of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, how does this General Staff vote?\"

It was rare that the General Staff ever voted, preferring to carry out their business by unanimous consent. It was necessary, however, for matters of significant importance.

Each member of the Staff entered their votes by mental intention, a simple mental gesture serving to indicate their votes. The vote count imprinted itself on their minds, not relying on anything so crude as vision. First came the immediate assent of reliable supporters such as Karishma Anand, De Chatillon, and Alexander. Porto and Feodorovich, generally more neutral, surprised her by immediately entering their "yea\" votes, without waiting for the majority to be confirmed. Sualem and Miller were \"nay\", of course.

Then, as the vote count passed twelve, the remaining \"yea\" votes came in, those voters who had waited longer expressing their lower degree of certainty by responding after the outcome was already determined. The vote was fifteen to six.

Taking a breath, Mami entered her vote, the traditional \"abstain\" for voting for oneself. Military Affairs followed a moment later, also with a traditional \"abstain\".

She watched as Sualem clamped his eyes shut, his face a study in uncomfortable despair, even as the other members of the \"nay\" group switched their votes to \"yea\" to conform with the majority.

A moment later he did so as well, followed by Military Affairs, then Mami herself. A unanimous confirmation, as tradition dictated.

Mami got out of her chair, head swimming, making her way to the front of the room.

*Congratulations,* Anand relayed to her.

*Thanks,* she thought.

She reached the front, pushing herself through the motions of shaking the hand of Military Affairs.

Then she turned, looking down the virtual table, at the dual rows of expectant faces, waiting for her to make the customary speech.

She opened her mouth to speak.

*What have I gotten myself into?* she thought.

## Aspects of Love 

> The origins of current immortality technology lie in the years leading up to the Unification Wars, in the efforts of the newly emergent hyperclasses, which were understandably unenthused by the prospect of their own mortality, the only obvious limitation on what were otherwise lives of luxury and unrestrained decadence.
>
> Longevity research was hardly a new phenomenon; exorbitant rejuvenation treatments had been developed as early as the 2090s. These, however, possessed severe flaws, including unpleasant side effects, incredibly exorbitant cost and, most importantly, lack of repeatability in the face of inexorable genetic and tissue damage. Even the luckiest of these early treatment recipients only saw their lifespans extended into the 160s, dying on the eve of war with their dreams of immortality unfulfilled.
>
> While this kind of lifespan made the hyperclasses Methuselahs compared to earlier generations, it was considered unsatisfactory. Tremendous resources were poured into anti‐aging research, vast numbers of scientists working tirelessly in enormous laboratories, as the masses around them languished and died, deprived even of cures to diseases long since eradicated in the rich.
>
> Progress was nonetheless frustrating. Nanotechnology had been used successfully in manufacturing and other applications for decades, but even with AI‐guidance, the biological equivalent was slow to develop---the first generations of nanites were finicky, relatively ineffective, and hard to maintain, the drone populations mutating uncontrollably far too often. Reversing or suspending aging was a subtle, difficult task, and while research teams managed startling feats of biological manipulation, these too often seemed inapplicable to the main problem, serving only as additional bodily modifications enterprising hyperclass members might find amusing.
>
> An application was found for this research soon enough, of course. The exigencies of total war tore apart the limits of what had once been considered acceptable, leading both sides to send into battle soldiers with progressively more extensive bionic and neural modifications, enabled by the very nanite technology that had previously seemed so useless. Even within the core nations of the United Front (UF), it soon became customary to think of the armed forces as a cyborg army---as this was in effect what they were.
>
> While it was the Freedom Alliance (FA) that took the technology far beyond the limits of ethics, even the UF performed actions that would have been absolutely unthinkable before the war, most notably with the Universal Readiness Decree of 2200, which began the mandatory installation of nanite‐based implant technology into the civilian population. The justification was, of course, creating a civilian population more productive, more resistant to attack---including nuclear attack---disease and deprivation, and capable of taking up arms in a post‐modern war that could no longer be fought by humans. With basic survival at the forefront, protests were muted, and unfortunate accidents that would have been major scandals in peacetime were brushed aside.
>
> At the end of the war, the Emergency Defense Council (EDC) restarted the stalled prewar research projects, under the new banner of Project Eden. With over a half‐century of feverish wartime research behind them, and a population already filled to the brim with bionic implants, a once‐frustrating problem proved surprisingly facile---where a prewar scientist might have hesitated to suggest installing an implant into the deep brainstem, a postwar scientist merely had to suggest modifications to what was already there. Decades of fine‐tuning and testing were necessary, but the problem had in essence been solved---it turned out, extensive cyborg modification was the answer.

It was snowing.

That wasn\'t really a surprise, of course. According to the handy travel guides her TacComp had downloaded for her, Roland Erwynmark\'s home planet of Bismarck had apparently once been the victim of a cataclysmic impact sequence, knocking its rotation radically off‐axis. This had the effect of greatly amplifying seasonal shifts across most of the planet, producing glaringly hot summers and sunless winters. Temperature discrepancies between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere during the cold or hot seasons led to massive superstorms.

Overall, the guide recommended, it was best to travel to Bismarck during the temperate seasons, when it was possible to watch the local fauna desperately mate as they fled across the continents in giant migratory herds, before there was nowhere to go and it was time to hunker down for either summer or winter. Even the plant life got in on the action, executing an exotic biannual lifestyle. While some of the settlements were in the tropics, and some groups of humans even emulated the animals, migrating back and forth across the continent, most human settlements weren\'t, instead located near important sources of minerals. Roland Erwynmark was from one of these settlements.

It was currently winter there.

*So if they went to all the trouble to put up weather control stations around the settlement, you\'d think they could make it so we wouldn\'t be surrounded by knee‐deep snow,* Ryouko thought.

*There are limits to reasonable uses of resources,* Clarisse thought. They don\'t have limitless energy from solar satellites like Earth. There\'s a limit to what you can do with geothermal. Besides, it\'s not so bad.*

*I know, obviously,* Ryouko thought. *Just complaining. And you know I know so stop being pedantic.*

It really wasn\'t that bad, to be honest. The implants made the cold mostly bearable, as long as you bundled up, and paving drones had been deployed to create ice paths that wound their way throughout the area. By simply putting on a pair of skates and letting your implants guide you, it was possible to have a quite pleasant experience exploring the area. It wasn\'t really something Ryouko had ever done---the climate control in Mitakihara prevented the city from ever experiencing more than mild \"holiday\" snow.

She had arrived a day early, and she figured she might as well look around a little.

*Maybe I could bring my parents or friends here,* she thought, as she peered at her surroundings, allowing her legs to propel her forward on the equivalent of autopilot.

Nominally, she was on the outskirts of the town of Neumalchin, population 15,673. In practice, she was in the middle of nowhere---there was nothing visible of the town from where she was, with her visibility impeded by the high snowbanks and dormant native plant life. The town was tiny and sparse, and no amount of renovations to old mining facilities---revamped as temporary housing for the incoming flux of dignitaries---could change that.

They could have melted the snow, of course, if they had really wanted to. The military had the resources, for an important event like this. But for what purpose? To reveal brown mud and leafless plants? It was pointless, and Erwynmark had apparently grown up with the snow---for half the year, anyway.

Ryouko held up her hands, breathing out. The cloud of condensation puffed outward at her mittened hands. The cold, the condensation, the mittens---it was all novel, and kind of fun, in a way, different from the paltry skin‐thin layer of snow Mitakihara was allowed.

She looked up, at the starry endless night, framed by tall, bare, native trees. Out here, in the breathtakingly muted snowy landscape, in the seemingly eternal dark, it seemed possible to get lost forever, to wander timelessly in the endless wilderness, blessed with eternal life, and to never return.

It seemed strangely enticing, but also a little sad. It occurred to her that it would be better experienced with someone else.

*Is it starting to happen?* she thought. *Am I finally starting to feel lonely?*

She skated silently for another long moment, brooding on the implications of the thought.

*Clarisse,* she began.

Then, before she knew what she was doing, she had jumped, spinning into the air, the world spinning into a blur around her. With twin bursts of magic, she partially transformed, an arbalest appearing on her left arm, and her skating shoes replacing themselves with more combat‐ready green boots.

The projectile missed her head by a mile, and she landed on the ice deftly, boots sticking to the surface with a flash of green light, achieving an impossible level of traction. Her left arm was already raised to fire.

But she hadn\'t completed the transformation, and she didn\'t fire, because she realized that the projectile was made, improbably, of snow.

The two culprits of the attack made a scared noise, hidden at the top of the snowbank, bright and obvious in Ryouko\'s infrared vision.

*Kids,* she thought.

She blinked, returning to standard vision, then jumped, clearing both snowbank and children in one powerful leap, turning as she did so, so that she could land behind them, and look down upon them.

Or so she planned, anyway, but in practice, she promptly wedged herself deep into the snow, and found herself more or less eye‐level with the wide‐eyed children who, she realized abruptly, were only a few years younger than she was. They had been tensing to run, and had clearly not expected her to react so adroitly.

\"And what was *that* about?\" she demanded, looking between the two kids, one a defiant‐looking thirteen‐year‐old boy and the other a scared‐looking twelve‐year‐old girl.

\"We didn\'t mean anything!\" the girl blurted out tremulously. \"We just wanted to see---\"

\"We were just playing,\" the boy said, peering at her pugnaciously. "Don\'t---\"

\"We heard there were a lot of magical girls in the area now,\" the girl said. \"We wanted to---\"

\"Don\'t tell her that!\" the boy said, glaring at the girl. \"Now---\"

Then he froze, a look of utter shock crawling up his face.

\"We\'re so sorry!\" he said, turning back towards Ryouko, his previously‐defiant expression suddenly terrified. \"We were just playing, Miss Shizuki! We didn\'t mean any disrespect!\"

*Their face scanners just processed who you are,* Clarisse explained, as Ryouko started to make a puzzled expression. *Hero of Orpheus.*

*Oh,* Ryouko thought, softening her expression so as not to scare them.

\"It\'s alright,\" Ryouko said reassuringly. \"No harm done. What are you two doing way out here?\"

\"Well...\" the boy began, looking away from her.

The girl, whose gaze had turned briefly worshipful, seemed to blush slightly.

\"Well,\" she said, looking downward bashfully. \"I thought it\'d be romantic---\"

\"Stop telling her these things!\" the boy shouted, suddenly blushing furiously.

Suddenly, Ryouko understood the situation.

She turned her head away instinctively, and fiddled with her arbalest briefly with her other hand. Then she realized what she was doing and abolished the weapon entirely.

\"So this kind of thing is considered romantic, huh?\" she asked, recalling her earlier train of thought.

*I can\'t believe I just said that!* she thought immediately.

*Oh God I\'m humiliating myself in front of my fans.*

She turned around to hide her face, a difficult task buried in the snow as she was, but one achievable with her considerable enhanced strength.

\"Well, I\'ll leave you two alone, then,\" she said.

Then she propelled herself into another jump, as the other two watched her, awestruck. Relying on her magical boots, she stuck her landing on the ice, and dispelled the boots, preparing to skate back.

\"Wait!\" the girl yelled, from behind her.

Ryouko turned back, to see the girl climbing awkwardly over the snowbank. Ryouko thought for a moment that she would fall, but the girl slid down the side with surprising skill, landing on the ice just as a set of skates deployed from her bulky‐looking boots.

\"Can we come with you?\" the girl asked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roland Erwynmark had been a town hero. More than just the prototypical local boy made good, he had also saved the town itself---he had started his military career here, tasked with leading the hastily assembled local militia in the defense of the town. That had been near the start of the war, when Bismarck---a relatively minor planet---had come under dispute. Neither side had committed many resources to a relative sideshow, at the very edge of the ambitious squid incursion, leaving the planet to defend itself with mostly its own resources.

Neumalchin had been a smaller‐scale version of the same phenomenon. A small mining town in the north, serving as a waypoint for scientific teams heading into the wilderness, was not high on the civil defense priority list, and had been lucky to receive enough outdated armor suits to outfit its adult population. Erwynmark was one of the few who had previously bothered to volunteer for militia training, and had more or less fallen into the leadership position.

It was a mystery why the aliens had even chosen to land the troops necessary to occupy the region---especially in the dead of winter---but when they did, they had likely expected to overrun Neumalchin as a matter of course.

Instead, the villagers\' last‐ditch defense of their town had become the stuff of planetary legend. The history holos Ryouko had accessed painted the experience vividly---villagers digging into snowbanks and ice, exploiting their mastery of the local terrain to the absolute hilt, and constantly jiggering and rejiggering their weather manipulation station to generate blizzard after blizzard in the face of alien counter‐manipulation. Erwynmark himself skated endlessly back and forth over the ice roads, moving from sector to sector without cessation, as their numbers continued to dwindle.

At the end they had finally been forced to withdraw underground, into the mining tunnels, following a morbid precedent set on colony world after colony world.

By the time the alien troops withdrew from the region, the villagers had long since cannibalized every building they had for the energy necessary to forge and reforge ammunition over and over, not to mention power their suits and fuel their increasingly deprived bodies. Alien corpses, human corpses, damaged equipment, trees, shrubs, weather phenomena, underground heat and biomass, the rarely‐visible sun---anything and everything that could be reacted or harnessed to generate usable energy was reacted or harnessed.

But in the end, they still stood, with hardly anything left but their own indomitable wills---and a much‐reduced population. The performance caught the eye of the planetary commander, who lifted Erwynmark to a higher position. The rest, as they say, was history.

All of which served to explain why as Ryouko and her newfound fans---friends?---made their way into the town square, they headed down Erwynmark Rd.,* past *Erwynmark Hall,* a monument to *Roland Erwynmark,* and finally into *Erwynmark Inn, Café, and Bar.*

To be fair, she had also passed monuments and roads named after other local heroes, including a monument to the magical girl team that had been involved in the battle, a paltry three girls strong---one local MSY‐assigned demon hunter and two newly‐contracted locals. The team had originally numbered five, but the MSY, seeing the apparent writing on the wall, had withdrawn all but the one who had refused to leave. In the end, only she had survived, forced to withdraw from fighting entirely to focus on demon hunting, lest the town be left without a single magical girl to fight demon hordes.

The town had been obliged to rebuild everything from the ground up, and was understandably fond of memorializing the most important event in its history. For the upcoming memorial service, the buildings were decked out in banners with Erwynmark\'s face and welcoming the crowd of dignitaries that would soon arrive---most of whom weren\'t here yet, since everyone was busy.

The girl Ryouko was with was named Priska Höfler, apparently, and seemed inordinately proud to be Erwynmark\'s second cousin\'s granddaughter. Ryouko had let the girl and her \"friend\" skate aimlessly with her for a while, until Ryouko had received an unexpected message summoning her back to town. The two teenagers---children?---had insisted on showing her the way, even though Clarisse had a map of the town downloaded and ready to use.

At the moment, Priska was filling her head with village color and gossip.

\"Anyway, so Amelie says she thinks it\'s insulting that so many of the, uh, dignitaries aren\'t coming in person, but Mama says it\'s understandable, since everyone is so busy. I mean, it makes sense, since I\'d guess that\'s why Mami‐san wouldn\'t come.\"

\"Yeah, something like that,\" Ryouko agreed.

\"It makes sense, of course,\" Priska continued, a little breathlessly. "I\'m sure they all have important business, but it sucks that Mami‐san isn\'t coming. She\'s so cool!\"

\"Yeah, she is kind of cool,\" Ryouko agreed.

\"Krista says Amelie is just sour because her parents won\'t approve of her dating so early. I feel bad for her, but only a little, because her parents have so much money. Compared to my family, anyway. The other day, we went to the general store, and they had this special nanofabricated jewel Mama wanted and my parents got into this big fight, right there in the store! Is it true, what they say, that people from Earth don\'t really care about money?\"

Ryouko had stayed mostly silent, not sure how to talk to them. She wasn\'t sure what this sensation was---Priska and her friend, Marcus, seemed unbearably young to her, the two‐year difference between them and her feeling like a chasm.

\"Uhh... yeah, pretty much,\" Ryouko said, looking at the other girl\'s wide eyes. \"More or less. I mean, we care a little, especially nowadays with the war on, but no one really thinks about it.\"

\"How much do you make?\"

\"Er...\" she prevaricated.

She consulted Clarisse quickly. Converted into local currency, the sum was astronomical---she could probably have bought that \"nanofabricated jewel\" hundreds of times over.

\"Uh...\" she repeated.

\"That\'s not a polite question, Priska,\" Marcus said, a little tersely. \"Anyway, we\'re here.\"

Indeed they were, the gray metal door of the inn sliding open at their approach.

Stepping inside, Ryouko glanced around, taking only a moment to find the girl who had summoned her.

Sakura Kyouko was seated at the bar, tearing her way energetically through a half‐eaten roast chicken---special local breed---holding one of the drumsticks in her hand and using it to gesture at Patricia, who was seated next to her looking bemused. Patricia had a plate with some of the chicken as well, but didn\'t really seem to be eating, probably afraid to get in Kyouko\'s way.

As a robot arrived to collect Ryouko\'s jacket and other cold‐weather accoutrements, Kyouko chugged the remaining third of her cup of beer then gestured at the bartender for more. Ryouko glanced at the kids with her, feeling suddenly uneasy. A memory flashed through her mind: blood and gore on the streets of a distant world, the remains of a girl that had sacrificed herself to save Patricia.

She swallowed, then walked forward.

Sensing her approach, Kyouko stopped eating abruptly, calmly and deliberately setting her food down and taking a moment to dab her mouth clean with a self‐cleaning cloth.

\"Yo,\" she said, turning half around in her rotating bar stool to face Ryouko. \"I see you\'ve made some new friends.\"

\"Ah, yes, uh,\" Ryouko began impotently, surprised.

\"Don\'t look so worried,\" Kyouko said, smiling toothily. \"There\'s nothing wrong with that. It\'s good to make a few friends your age. Come on, take a seat. The rest of you too. Order something. My treat.\"

*To her, we really are the same age,* Ryouko realized, as she walked over to the seat next to Kyouko.

Patricia gestured at the two kids, who shuffled hesitantly over, Marcus mumbling something about messaging his mother.

\"I, uh, thought you weren\'t coming to this,\" Ryouko said. She *had checked the list of attendees, after all.

\"I wasn\'t going to,\" Kyouko said, chewing thoughtfully on some meat. "Mami was pressuring me to, to make up for her absence, but funerals ain\'t my thing, especially the gloomy type. I hate going to them, to be honest.\"

Ryouko craned her head slightly, to make sure the two locals were okay. Patricia seemed to be chatting them up, so she decided not to worry about it.

\"So what changed your mind?\" Ryouko asked.

\"I heard you were coming,\" Kyouko said, working delicately at the chicken in front of her with a knife and chopsticks. \"And I thought I\'d check up on you. I am supposed to be your mentor, after all.\"

Ryouko nodded.

After a moment of silence, Ryouko started to access the menu, not sure what else to say.

\"I\'d ask you how things are,\" Kyouko said, \"but it\'d probably be a useless question. Things are probably changing so fast that even you don\'t know what\'s going on with your life. That\'s probably the way things are, right?\"

Ryouko thought about it a moment, then nodded. It was accurate enough. For the past few weeks, she had mostly let the flow of events carry her along, too bewildered to be capable of anything else.

She wasn\'t really sure if it was a bad thing, though. She seemed to be going places, intentionally or not. And besides, in an organization such as the military, how much could she really change on her own?

\"I\'ve been okay,\" she said. \"There\'s been a lot going on, obviously.\"

She knew that was a tremendous understatement, but she wasn\'t really sure how else to put it.

\"That\'s an understatement if I\'ve ever heard one,\" Kyouko said, instantly mirroring Ryouko\'s thoughts. \"I was sorry to hear about your grandmother, by the way. My condolences.\"

\"Oh, yeah, it\'s, uh, thanks,\" Ryouko responded, caught off‐guard.

\"I\'m not surprised you pulled off a big stunt like that,\" Kyouko said, focusing for a moment again on her food. \"For Mami to glom onto you that quickly is usually a sign. Hmm, well, I can admit the stunt was a bit bigger than I had imagined it being.\"

Kyouko turned her head to look at Ryouko, very deliberately, and Ryouko found herself staring back into the Ancient\'s eyes.

*Let\'s pretend to eat for a while,* Ryouko heard Kyouko think, the voice resonating in her head. *Whatever you might have told everyone else, I know the Goddess was involved. I am the head of the religion, after all, so I\'d like to hear about it.*

Ryouko let out the breath she had been holding. Somehow, she had contrived to completely forget about that aspect of things.

*Why are we holding this conversation in a public bar?* she asked, buying time while also asking a pertinent question.

Kyouko shrugged.

*Figured I might as well get in a lesson about the world while I was at it. You see that couple at the table over there? Don\'t look too directly.*

Kyouko pinged her the location telepathically. Ryouko glanced where she indicated, trying to do it out of the corner of her eye. They looked fairly nondescript, except that they were obviously from out of town. Thinking back, they hadn\'t been there earlier, so they had probably come in after Ryouko did.

*Reporters,* Kyouko said. *They\'ve barely touched their food, they\'re trying too hard to blend in, and the male one can\'t stop himself from glancing over. The town is infested with them, but they try to hide themselves. These two have probably been following you for a while. Notice any drones following you on your way here, by the way?*

Ryouko, a little slack‐jawed, starting shaking her head, before stopping herself.

*No,* she thought.

*There were at least a couple,* Kyouko thought. *Anyway, those reporters are probably really ticked off right now, since it seems none of their recording devices are working, and they can\'t even crank up their auditory implants. What a shame. It\'s almost as if there were some kind of electronics expert here suppressing them with her magic.*

Kyouko smirked a little, glancing for a moment at Patricia, who seemed to be talking to the two kids animatedly about genetics or something.

A moment later one of the reporters yelped in surprise, as her plate of food spontaneously upended itself into her lap.

*The point is,* Kyouko thought. *You got to pay more attention to this kind of thing, now that people know who you are. You probably also didn\'t notice the telekinetic I put in the other corner.*

*No,* Ryouko thought, looking confusedly. Yes, there was a girl there, but was she---

She frowned for a moment, then finally picked up the hint of magic, very carefully suppressed.

\"So how did you find training?\" Kyouko asked, out loud. \"I\'m always curious to hear what new girls think about it, since they don\'t make us Old Ones do anything like it.\"

The open speech surprised Ryouko, but before she could respond, Kyouko thought:

*Missing a magical signature like that would have gotten you killed, back in my day,* Kyouko thought. *Anyway, enough small talk. I\'d like to hear about the Goddess. I notice you didn\'t exactly deny it before.*

A moment later, having sorted out the confusing situation, Ryouko sighed. She was cornered, and she knew it.

\"It was everything everyone said it would be,\" Ryouko said, a nice safe response that required no thought. \"It felt like it took forever, but it all feels kind of fuzzy. That\'s intentional, apparently.\"

A moment later, she appended her real response:

*She came to me and told me how the battle was going. She said I was going to make a mistake, since I didn\'t know about the fleet that the aliens had cloaked. I was going to just try to take the team home. She\'s the one who said I should try to reopen the wormhole.*

Kyouko nodded, then turned, staring into Ryouko\'s eyes unnervingly.

\"You make any friends during training? I\'m told the friends you make during training are often the closest.\"

*Did she give you the power to do it?* Kyouko asked, seemingly simultaneously, leaving Ryouko blinking. Had Kyouko just relayed one thought while speaking another?

\"I made a few,\" Ryouko said blandly, hoping that her facial expression wasn\'t betraying their mental conversation.

*I don\'t think so,* Ryouko thought. *I think I could do that on my own.*

Kyouko seemed to chuckle slightly, then put some of her food into her mouth, chewing thoughtfully.

*Some of the Theological Council think no ordinary magical girl could do something like that, that you had to have some power boost from the Goddess. I told them they didn\'t have enough faith in ordinary magical girls. You are ordinary, right? She didn\'t tell you you\'re the new prophet or anything?*

A memory echoed in Ryouko\'s mind suddenly, unbidden. It was the Goddess\'s voice:

\"*You don\'t know it, but this is one of the things you were born for.*\"

*One of---*

Ryouko felt suddenly dizzy, but hid it as best she could.

*She didn\'t.*

Kyouko nodded to herself.

\"I\'m told you made one particularly good friend, actually,\"

*Is there anything else you want to share? If it\'s relevant to the Church, or Humanity, or anything like that, I\'d like to hear it. But if she gave you relationship advice or something, you don\'t have to tell me about it if you don\'t want to. You wouldn\'t believe how often she does that, on the side. Well, so I\'m told, anyway.*

Another memory flashed through Ryouko\'s mind, of Maki\'s body being torn apart. This one was a repeat, but it only served to make her queasier.

*Am I traumatized or something*? she thought to herself. *I don\'t usually---*

\"I\'m not sure what you mean,\" she said, stalling for time. She didn\'t like either of the topics they were discussing, and having to think about both at the same time made her head hurt. It didn\'t help that Kyouko persisted in saying two things at the same time.

*Not that I\'d like to share,* she relayed to Kyouko, even though she was starting to think that, indeed, one of the visions was directly relevant to Kyouko. She didn\'t want to deal with it.

*Fair enough,* Kyouko thought, nodding, pushing away her plate, which was now empty. Ryouko wondered how she had managed to miss Kyouko finishing all that food.

*I\'d really rather you not tell everyone I said this,* Ryouko thought.

Kyouko turned towards her elaborately, filling in the apparent gap in their verbal conversation.

*As much as I\'d like to blare the trumpets on this,* Kyouko thought, looking at Ryouko thoughtfully. *I wouldn\'t do that to you if you don\'t want me to. And I can definitely understand why you wouldn\'t want to. I won\'t be that kind of asshole. Maybe someday, later, though. Why haven\'t you joined the Church? It\'s a simple registration. There are benefits.*

Ryouko blinked, trying to think of something.

*Nevermind,* Kyouko thought. *Later.*

\"Let be more specific, then,\" Kyouko said. \"I hear you\'re involved in a relationship now. With a girl too. Good for you! Obviously, I\'m supportive.\"

Ryouko\'s eye twitched. The two local villagers, who had been quietly staring at the two of them, easily heard Kyouko\'s suddenly loud voice.

Ryouko felt herself blush. She put her hands to her head.

\"First, I don\'t know why everyone knows about that. Second, this is barely a week old, and isn\'t even that certain, and everyone is taking it as fact. Third, if those are really reporters over there, do you realize what you just started?\"

She slammed her palm into the table at the end of the last sentence, then realized she was talking way too loud.

She covered her mouth with her hand to hide her embarrassment.

\"Anyway, you\'re taking it way too seriously,\" she finished.

\"Well, I was just saying, if you want special advice, I got plenty of that,\" Kyouko said, smiling mischievously. \"If you know what I mean. Besides, I\'m sure the media already knows. Probably.\"

Ryouko made an annoyed noise, deep in her throat.

\"I don\'t know what you mean, and don\'t tell me. Anyway, I\'m not sure I should take relationship advice from you, given---\"

Ryouko stopped herself in time, but Kyouko\'s smile still turned abruptly brittle, as if she had just received a particularly effective gut punch.

The effect lasted only a moment, though, before dissipating, as Kyouko\'s smile returned to normal.

\"You\'ve heard the rumors, I guess?\" Kyouko said. \"Well, I wasn\'t exactly offering advice in long‐term relationships. Anyway...\"

With suspiciously good timing, a server‐bot appeared behind the counter, delivering in front of Ryouko one sirloin steak, served with local vegetables and horseradish sauce, served *very* rare. Ryouko could almost swear she saw blood leaking out of it.

\"For you,\" Kyouko said. \"Thought I\'d surprise you. The blood makes it taste better. Side effect of the implants. I gotta get going. Patricia wants to talk to you, I can\'t imagine why, but---\"

Kyouko glanced at Patricia, who seemed to be playing some sort of virtual game with the two kids.

\"---later, I guess,\" Kyouko finished. \"You have no idea how much she likes kids, if you can force her out of the lab. Anyway, last bit of advice: watch out for people trying to get into your pants. See ya.\"

\"Uh, see you,\" Ryouko barely managed in time, as Kyouko hopped off the bar bench and zoomed out the door, dodging and weaving so effectively that the waiters and tables in her way might as well not have been there.

Ryouko watched her go for a moment, then turned back towards her plate. After meditating for a moment on what the last thing Kyouko had said was all about, she carved off a sliver of the meat with a knife and tried it.

Her eyes widened.

*I\'m starting to wonder if I should just start asking the synthesizer for raw meat and be done with it,* she thought, as she started tearing into the rest of it, exerting a disturbing amount of willpower to force herself to use knife and fork.

*A lot of those in the military do, actually,* Clarisse thought. *They even have a club. Remember, the goal is to make sure that soldiers can eat anything and everything to survive. It took some work to make sure people didn\'t starve themselves from refusing to eat something horrible‐tasting. Add in an \'unplanned\' interaction with the enhanced olfaction and this is the result you get. Of course, many people suspect one of the design AIs was playing a joke.*

*Why wasn\'t it ever fixed?* Ryouko asked.

*Some people liked it too much, and petitioned to have it deliberately left in. There\'s an option to have it fixed, if you really want to.*

*Maybe later.*

Something moved in the corner of her eye, prompting her to look up. A girl stood there, next to the seat where Kyouko had been. Ryouko glanced over her quickly---about her age, at least in appearance, with a soul gem ring---

\"Hi there,\" the girl said. \"Is this seat taken?\"

Ryouko glanced at Patricia, who was still focused on some sort of VR sim.

\"I don\'t think so,\" Ryouko said, who started to turn back to her food.

\"That looks good,\" the girl said, gesturing at the steak. \"I guess I\'ll have whatever that is.\"

Ryouko smiled politely.

\"Yeah, it is pretty good,\" she said.

It occurred to her that the other girl was dressed quite well---certainly much better than the generic thick shirt and pants Ryouko had on.

Ryouko pondered for a moment how much cleavage the other girl was showing. The way that necklace went in and out...

Then she realized that she was staring, and looked up hastily.

\"I\'ll be honest; when I saw you here, I had to talk to you,\" the girl said. \"It\'s always nice to meet someone else from the family, especially a \'hero\' like you.\"

The girl held up her necklace, smiling brightly, so that Ryouko could finally see what was at the end of it.

*Oh, a Shizuki!* she thought, quickly peering at the girl\'s face and calling up her nomenclator.

###### \"*Shizuki, Azusa*\" 

-   **Gender:** *Female Age: Occupation:** *Investment Banker, Hashimoto and Sinclair Investments and Securities*; *Magical Girl* (inactive (special dispensation Rank:** *Captain Special Comments: Sixth Cousin of* Shizuki Ryouko; *member, Shizuki Matriarchy*

\"Listen,\" the girl said, leaning over and touching Ryouko on the arm. "The family is holding a function later tonight, in one of the nearby cities. Sayaka herself will be there. I\'d love to take you there after we\'re done with the food. I want to hear about your mission. We can chat, and I can show you my room.\"

For a moment, Ryouko found herself staring into the other girl\'s limpid green eyes.

\"Excuse me!\"

Appearing out of nowhere, Patricia rudely shoved her way in between the two of them, so that Ryouko abruptly found herself looking into Patricia\'s pale‐blue eyes instead.

\"Sorry to interrupt,\" Patricia said, apologizing belatedly to Azusa. "But Shizuki‐san here has a critical appointment that she has clearly completely forgotten.*\"

Patricia gave Ryouko an accusatory look, but also sent a telepathic message:

*Just play along.*

\"What?\" Ryouko asked, too confused to understand fast enough. Fortunately, that fit exactly with her assigned role.

*How the hell is it possible to forget an appointment?* she protested, as Patricia dragged her toward the exit. *I mean we have TacComps!*

The other girl just ignored her, continuing to pull her out the door. Just as Ryouko was about to protest again, this time out loud, Patricia turned to look at her, putting a finger to her lips, signaling silence.

So Ryouko stayed quiet as Patricia half‐dragged, half‐walked her out of the restaurant, around the corner, down an alley, and into a small alcove, barely giving the two of them enough time to get their winter clothing back from the server‐bot.

*There, this should be isolated enough,* Patricia thought, looking back out at the sky. *Can never be too paranoid about these things.*

*Can you tell me what that was about?* Ryouko asked, working her way back into her thick jacket. *All of that was a bit rude, if I may say so.*

Patricia turned to look at her, and Ryouko could see a smirk travel across her face, only partly suppressed.

\"I\'d forgotten what it\'s like to be so innocent,\" Patricia said, smiling. \"Don\'t you know a seduction attempt when you see one?\"

Ryouko blinked, making a confused face.

\"What?\"

\"A seduction attempt,\" Patricia repeated, continuing to give Ryouko an amused look. \"Where an unusually good‐looking girl approaches you dressed revealingly, acts friendly, and asks you to go visit her room. Come on.\"

Ryouko narrowed her eyes, the shadow of the building falling lightly over her face.

\"Are you sure? Maybe she was just being friendly.\"

Patricia shook her head.

\"Trust me, she wasn\'t. Take the word of your elder. That was a determined attempt to, uh, get down the skirts of someone too young to know what was going on, if you\'ll pardon me. Seems like the Shizuki family is getting serious about pulling you in. A sixth cousin marriage would be just the thing.\"

Ryouko looked down for a moment. It didn\'t...

She shook her head.

\"Aren\'t you being too paranoid?\" she asked. \"Maybe she just wanted to hit on me.\"

It felt weird saying the words, as if the very concept of someone "hitting\" on her was too strange.

\"No,\" Patricia said, shaking her head again, then pinning her with a look. \"It\'s too much of a coincidence. The Hero of Orpheus is a hot commodity right now. And with your family background, a Shizuki girl wandering into a bar dressed to entice going after you can\'t be anything else. Not every suitor is going to send you a nice monographed letter. For all we know, Shizuki Sayaka sent the girl herself.\"

Ryouko frowned, feeling strange. She didn\'t like thinking ill of people on so little evidence, but Patricia just seemed so *sure.*

\"Honestly, it isn\'t really my business,\" Patricia continued. \"But Kyouko wants me to help keep them away from you, especially now that you might have something of your own going on.\"

In Ryouko\'s mind\'s eye, a message twirled, having just arrived. A follow‐up from Azusa telling her where the \"function\" was, and telling her she should still go.

A moment later, Ryouko sent a message demurring, saying something had come up. It wasn\'t as if she really liked parties, anyway.

\"Do people really do things like that?\" Ryouko asked, looking up.

\"It\'s a cutthroat world, way more than it should be,\" Patricia said. "Trust me, if the Von Rohr family thought they could get away with it, they\'d try to talk me into doing the same to you, right now. Not every matriarchy is like that, but many are.\"

Patricia turned away, facing the gray sky again, and Ryouko thought the other girl looked bothered.

She sighed. It didn\'t feel like the best time to ask, but she felt she had to, eventually. Besides, she wanted to talk about something else.

\"Alright, I\'ll listen to you,\" Ryouko said, letting it go. \"But on a different subject, how is Kishida‐san doing? I heard she, uh, lost her body.\"

Patricia turned, a little quickly, taken aback.

\"You heard about that?\" she asked. \"She\'s doing okay. New body and all that, so it takes some adjusting to.\"

Patricia seemed unnerved, and for a moment the two of them met eyes. Finally, just as Ryouko was about to change topics again, Patricia spoke without prompting, looking away.

\"The truth is, she isn\'t doing that well,\" she said, voice hushed. "She seemed alright when I saw her before the bodyloss, but she really isn\'t taking the breakup well. I think she really expected that Kyouko would show up if she got seriously injured, but Kyouko didn\'t. Now they\'re holding her back for psych reasons. I visited her. She isn\'t doing too well. I---\"

Patricia took a breath.

\"They---Asaka said, and Kyouko too, that I made mistakes, in my command. That I hadn\'t executed well. Something like that.\"

The burst of words surprised Ryouko, who really hadn\'t expected more than a \"she\'s fine, thanks for asking.\"

\"I told Kyouko she *had* to visit,\" Patricia said, voice starting to rise into anger. \"But she wouldn\'t do it, even though I know she wants to. Damn stubborn pride, I guess, or something. Of course, she thinks since she\'s an Ancient she knows better than someone like me. I guess maybe she does. If I hadn\'t---I mean, she---\"

Patricia stopped abruptly, still in mid‐gesture with her hands held out in front of her and her ponytail hanging down over her shoulder. She seemed to take a breath and calm a little.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said, standing up straight again and looking at Ryouko. \"I\'m acting crazy. I needed to get that off my chest. I--I don\'t know. It hasn\'t been a good couple of days for me. I\'m going back to Earth, to see if maybe I can work myself into the telecluster, and Asaka has been---my damn family is butting in on my life again. What does it matter if---\"

Patricia shook her head at herself.

\"Whatever, I\'m not even half a century old, so it\'s alright if I embarrass myself a little, but before I make this any worse, let me get this over with.\"

Watching the other girl with her shoulders slumped, Ryouko had the unsettling feeling that she was supposed to be saying or doing anything, but... she had no idea what.

Then the moment passed and, taking another breath, Patricia reached into one of the pockets on her jacket.

*I don\'t really know how to ask this,* Patricia said. *But I want to do a deeper genetic analysis on you. The sample I got from you last time didn\'t... well, I want to do a broader sample of your somatic cells. Sometimes different parts of the body can have different genetics.*

Ryouko stared for a moment, then crinkled her forehead.

*What do you mean? What\'s wrong with my genes? Does this have anything to do with the six‐sigma thing?*

Genetic disease was supposed to be impossible now, but---

*There\'s nothing wrong with you,* Patricia said. *I\'m just thinking something might be weird. This is just a weird hobby of mine, since I\'m a scientist. If you don\'t want to, that\'s perfectly alright---*

*No, it\'s fine,* Ryouko said. *What will it take to do this analysis?*

*A nanite microinjection, to gather samples. Like I said, if it bothers you, you don\'t have to.*

Ryouko mulled over the question. Injecting nanites did seem a little---

*I think you should do it,* Clarisse thought, interjecting her opinion unexpectedly.

*What? Why?* Ryouko thought back.

*I just think it\'d be interesting to see what she finds,* Clarisse thought. *I\'m also a little curious about what I\'m built out of.*

Ryouko thought for a moment longer, then nodded in assent.

\"Alright,\" she said out loud. \"I\'m probably being way too trusting, though.\"

Patricia smiled, then stepped forward, touching the side of Ryouko\'s neck, holding an injection patch to the side for a few moments.

*That should be it,* Patricia thought. *I\'ll try to catch you after the ceremonies to collect them back.*

The two girls looked at each other for a moment, without much to say.

\"Why don\'t we go take a walk around the town?\" Patricia suggested finally. \"I should give you some advice. It will be better than anything Kyouko would tell you, anyway.\"

\"I suppose,\" Ryouko said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tomoe Mami peered down on the crowd from her podium, resplendent in her full dress uniform, or so she hoped.

Holding a service in Erwynmark\'s hometown was an extravagance. He had even said as much, when he requested it in his will, stating \"as a selfish request\" that if he must die, he could at least give his mother somewhere to visit, since he hadn\'t given her any grandchildren. It was typical of him.

Preparing the venue, assembling the dignitaries---all of those would have been costly enough even in a more customary location, such as the new flagship of the fleet, the Zhukov, or in St. Petersburg. Even after all their efforts, the structures that now dotted the town cemetery couldn\'t really compare to the majesty of deep space, or to the soaring arches and statues that composed Memorial Tower, the works of man rising defiantly into the sky.

It didn\'t have to, she thought. The bare‐branched alien trees, the snowy graveyard filled with those who had died in Erwynmark\'s first battle, seemed austere enough.

She couldn\'t resist glancing down at her arm, just for a moment. Everything was as it should have been, not even the slightest of ripples to give away that she wasn\'t really here, that this was only a holographic avatar. In the end, she supposed it didn\'t really matter, but she should have still appeared in person---if only she hadn\'t been so *busy*!

She had spent so long working over the words of the eulogy she was supposed to give, the one he had asked her to give. She had read the message he had left her, and found herself surprisingly teary‐eyed. Another piece of her heart was going under the soil, and she wondered if there was any of it left. That was her flaw---that she came to see everyone she worked with as special, and then mourned them when they died, as they always seemed to.

She took a moment to steady herself, relying on Machina to hide it from the crowd, to continue the illusion that always surrounded her existence. When she finally started to speak, it came as almost a surprise.

\"There are many good people in this world. They are all around us, working the fields, the factories, the labs, the stars. They grow food, make tools, and explore new worlds. They are the lifeblood of civilization.\"

She paused a moment, for effect.

\"Akemi Homura, may she find peace, once told me about the meanings behind the MSY logo, the shooting star. It used to be said that one could make wishes upon shooting stars, that a wish made as one fell would come true. That is the obvious meaning, but the legend also contains a kernel of truth. For, you see, the trajectory of a magical girl\'s life was once, centuries ago, to make a wish, burn bright in the sky, and then burn out, and the brighter she burned, the faster she fell.\"

She had barely gotten the censors to approve that last sentence as it was, and she would never append the rest of what Homura had said, during a rare weak moment: that the shooting star was a symbol of the Goddess, resembling her true symbol and appearing on her \"Grief Seed\", and that sometimes shooting stars were so bright, so powerful, that they crashed into the earth below and changed all that was. Such ramblings she kept to herself, even from---*especially* from---Kyouko.

Even if, loathe as she was to admit it, she was beginning to wonder.

She continued:

\"Roland Erwynmark was one of the bright stars. He aspired to be not just good, but good *and* great. He desired to be remembered, unlike most of us, who desire only to live, to continue to lead good and happy lives. In that sense, it is perhaps unsurprising that I am standing here reading his eulogy so soon. Bright stars are rare, and deserve celebration---but that does not mean we should not also mourn.\"

She took a breath, both for dramatic effect and from a bit of legitimate emotion.

\"When I first met Roland, I found him to be brash, impetuous, and altogether too aggressive. He had been freshly promoted after a series of victories on this very world. I expected experience to teach him a lesson, and while it did temper some of those qualities, I did not expect him to teach us a lesson, instead.\"

She leaned on the podium.

\"At my *advanced* age\"---she paused, allowing the audience to chuckle a little---\"I\'ve always found it difficult to respect those much younger than me. I\'ve always thought of him as a boy, even as he led fleets in campaigns without end, ended the Samsaran offensive, and destroyed the Saharan shipyard. Even now, though I know it\'s unfair, I can\'t stop remembering that fresh‐faced officer I saw at the beginning of the war. I admit, it took me a while to appreciate his qualities. I sound like a parent, I know.\"

Some laughter from the audience. She nodded respectfully at Erwynmark\'s mother, seated in the front row. She closed her eyes for a moment, and an image flashed through her mind, of a pair of mourning parents, old and vulnerable, centuries ago, when she had given a similar eulogy.

But this was a different funeral, a different world, a different time, and no one was old anymore---on the outside, anyway.

\"It takes a lot to gain my respect these days, but Roland thoroughly earned it, so much so that when he selected me to lead the recent defense of the Euphratic Sector, I took it as validation of my own abilities. Thinking of him now, I remember all the times we planned together, in the Saharan Sector, and in the years since. I found his insight always valuable, and his words strangely inspiring.\"

Now Mami felt Erwynmark\'s mother giving her a strange look. Had she misspoken?

\"In the end, we dimmer stars can only do our best to remember those such as Roland Erwynmark, who leave their mark on the world so brightly. I will miss him, and his leadership. Thank you.\"

Erwynmark\'s mother began to walk forward, and Mami headed for her seat on the stage, where her avatar would sit respectfully for the rest of the ceremony, while most of her consciousness worked on something else. As she walked over, though, she spotted her protégé, Shizuki Ryouko, seated in a place of honor in the audience.

She was frowning.

> 〈Because of the fear and ostracism they often faced, MSY leadership took great pains to reduce the visibility of their soul mages, many of which could be legitimately reclassified into other mage classes. The kind of powers they wielded often had little use in the ordinary course of magical girl life, and those with particularly developed powers were quietly funneled into roles where they might be of most use, such as the Soul Guard, the Black Heart, or Governmental Affairs. In later years, they were also extensively used by the MHD for their ability to keep the soul gems of heavily injured girls inert while their bodies were being repaired.

Those who *are* pure soul mages, however, often take the reverse path, with equivalent amounts of work.〉⑤

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stepping off the plane, Ryouko rubbed her cheek absently.

*It\'s probably not a good idea to touch it so much,* Clarisse pointed out. *It might give you away, not to mention you might accidentally knock it off.*

*Oh, right, sorry,* she said, jerking her hand away, probably too aggressively.

The tiny metal cylinder attached to her cheek had been a gift from Mami, a miniature holoemitter capable of subtly reshaping her face so that she looked like someone else---someone who strongly resembled Shizuki Ryouko, perhaps, but who clearly looked different, and who anyone with a face scanner would be informed was a 14‐year‐old magical girl who might have reason to travel alone on a commercial scramjet. Initially, she had been afraid that no such girl would exist, but it turned out she was related to a bevy of them. Currently, she was traveling as a distant aunt she hadn\'t known she had.

The point was so that she could travel incognito, of course, without being recognized by the media or her new fanbase. If finding someone suitable had truly been a problem, a false identity would have been fabricated from whole cloth and inserted into the Governance database. So Mami had assured her.

It diminished her faith in the integrity of Governance databases, but she had to admit it was clever, and even cool. She had spent part of the flight over from the Singaporean space elevator examining her appearance within the holographic entertainment console---she was sure the aunt had inherited better looks than she had.

She paused at the side of the walkway, trying to peer at her reflection in one of the windows.

*You\'re being too paranoid,* Clarisse thought. *You look fine.*

*They\'re not going to recognize me,* Ryouko thought. *It\'s terrible, coming back to see them again, and I can\'t even look like myself.*

*It\'ll only be for a while,* Clarisse reassured. *They\'ve been told what to expect. Come on, chin up. If you linger too long, people will start to suspect something is up.*

Ryouko nodded, and walked onward, taking a deep breath. She hadn\'t said anything, but she was appreciative of how supportive Clarisse was being.

*I turned down the sarcasm dial,* Clarisse thought, demonstrating her ability to intercept Ryouko\'s thoughts seemingly at will. *For better or worse, you\'re still my host, and I have to take care of you.*

*That\'s surprisingly heartwarming,* Ryouko thought. *Should I---*

*Don\'t worry about it.*

Clarisse\'s voice seemed to carry with it a trace of humor and a feeling of... well, warmth, which felt far more powerful than it usually did.

*Are you manipulating my emotions?* she thought, figuring that she needed to ask.

*I\'m just sharing some of mine. Did you know? We\'re programmed to bond to our hosts emotionally. So I\'m like a little baseball‐sized clone of you, with motherly feelings. Lots of oxytocin involved in this.*

Ryouko looked down for a moment as she stepped onto one of the intra‐airport transports, her luggage lifting itself into the vehicle behind her.

*I\'m not going to lie,* she thought. *That got a little weird there. Does it bother---*

*Yeah, I agree. It got weird. Let\'s change topics. Apparently, Governance is already assembling a production committee to make a movie about the wormhole mission. They\'re wondering if you\'ll consent to help out, especially the next time you\'re on Earth.*

Ryouko sighed.

*Do I have to?* she pleaded.

They *can\'t make you, no,* Clarisse thought. *But others can. As I\'m sure you remember, your current standing orders---*

*\'Cooperate with any Governance public relations or propaganda efforts that request your assistance.\'* Ryouko quoted. *\'Conduct yourself in a dignified manner befitting a hero of humanity, and help to foster a sense of excitement in the public.\'*

She put her head into the window next to her, forehead first. She wasn\'t looking forward to it.

*It\'s not very \'dignified\' to lean your head against the window like that. The other people on the transport are looking at you.*

*I thought I was on leave,* Ryouko grumbled.

*You\'re on* extended *leave, in exchange for doing this. That was the deal.*

*I don\'t recall agreeing to this \'deal\'. As I recall, it was foisted on me.*

*Many would kill to be in your position,* Clarisse reminded. *Besides, it won\'t be that bad. You\'ll be in a movie! You\'ll be played by a famous movie star! Think about it: your friends can watch---*

*I don\'t want to think about it,* she groaned.

*Ryouko...*

Ryouko finally sat back up, as the transport seemed to be approaching the waiting area.

*Please don\'t use that tone of voice,* she requested. *You remind me of mama, except you\'re using my voice, and that is deeply confusing to me.*

Then the transport doors opened, and Ryouko shuffled out the door along with the others.

She headed straight for the location where her family was waiting, locations marked on her internal map. They were waiting in a suitably discreet private room---it was not unheard of for members of the media to stalk family members of a famous individual.

Something occurred to her.

*No, there\'s no need to introduce me to your family,* Clarisse thought, again intercepting the thought. *At least not immediately. It\'s not like I\'m your new lover.*

*But you* are *attached---*

*It\'s okay. Really. I\'d rather not. It\'d be awkward.*

Then Ryouko let the topic drop, because she was there.

She stood there for a moment as the door closed behind her, facing her parents, who were sitting on opposite sides of a long table, and her grandfather, who had also gotten leave, returning home much earlier than she had.

*It\'s only been a couple of weeks, but---*

Then, realizing she was safe, she turned off the disguise module.

\"Mama!\" she exclaimed, louder than she would have ever expected herself to, running forward to embrace the woman.

They hugged for a long moment, her mother running her hands through her hair.

\"I missed you,\" her mother said. \"You don\'t know how much I worried.\"

Ryouko nodded, without looking up, then released the hug.

She turned to her father, who just smiled and nodded, then patted her on the shoulder awkwardly.

She understood the gesture, though, and for a moment, just stood there, basking in the love, raising a hand to wipe at some moisture in her eyes.

It was something about their body language that dispelled the moment---something about the way her grandfather seemed to be grimacing slightly, something about the way her parents stood unusually far apart.

\"Is---\" she began, before realizing she didn\'t even know what she was asking.

Her mother\'s teary smile wavered, just a little.

Ryouko felt a sense of tensed anticipation seeming to come from Clarisse, and, despite the situation, sent a query. Maybe her TacComp knew.

*I don\'t,* Clarisse thought. *But something is wrong. I think you\'ve noticed.*

Her mother looked down at her hands, blinking.

\"We didn\'t want anyone to tell you, but there\'s no hiding it anymore. I guess you\'re old enough.\"

Ryouko met her eyes, then glanced around, at her father and grandfather, who looked suddenly grim.

Her mother sighed.

\"We\'ve divorced,\" she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*It was amicable.*

The words echoed in her mind, and it often had the past day. It bothered her deeply, for reasons she couldn\'t exactly pinpoint.

Why hadn\'t she seen it coming? In retrospect, it had been obvious. The arguments, the occasional bouts of hostility, the casual lack of romance---

No, that wasn\'t necessarily true. What was it Clarisse had said? Hindsight bias. It only seemed obvious because she was looking at it in retrospect. In the end, she had been the last to find out because that was what her parents had wanted. Ironic, that they could still work well together on something like that.

Or that was what she told herself, at least. It made her feel better, but the honest part of her knew she hadn\'t *wanted* to know, which had definitely played a factor in things.

So, instead of going back to the home she remembered, the view of the city she remembered, the bed she remembered, she had found herself in her father\'s new apartment, staying in the cramped guest room. The plan had been for her to spend most time on Earth at her mother\'s, but her grandfather was already there, and the crowded conditions of Mitakihara didn\'t allow for extra space for those who were only home rarely---or else one of her parents could have just kept the old flat.

So her father\'s apartment it was, and despite the obvious attempts he had made to spruce the place up, it was still clearly a bachelor pad. She might have expected better from someone over a century, but she didn\'t really. Her parents had colluded well enough to have the things she had left at home, including her clothes, ready and waiting for her, which she did appreciate.

It felt like her world had broken up, and she would have to rebuild it, but that was what she had wanted, wasn\'t it?

Clarisse had known, of course---not about the divorce, but about the marital acrimony. She had a hard time blaming her. After all, what could she have---

\"Ryouko!\"

Ryouko shook herself out of her reverie and looked up. Her father was peering down at her from outside the vehicle, a touch of concern on his face.

\"We\'re here,\" he said, gently.

He extended his hand to her, an unheard of gesture for him, enough to unnerve Ryouko slightly.

Nonetheless, she took his hand, allowing him to help her out of the vehicle.

She took a moment to peer upward, at the steel, glass, and stone edifice of Prometheus Research Center. It glimmered in the sunlight.

\"Ryouko‐chan, are you all right?\"

\"I\'m fine, papa,\" she said, smiling reassuringly. \"Come on, let\'s go.\"

She led the way into the facility, whose door was already open, knowing she couldn\'t stay in front for long, since she didn\'t have access to a map of the building.

Her father caught up with her a moment later. For a while, she let him lead her.

She felt guilty; here she was, set to attend Asami\'s revival---resurrection?---and she found herself consumed by thoughts of her parents, rather than worrying about the girl whose event this was.

Strictly speaking, the scientists and psychiatrists had no evidence about what had helped precipitate Asami\'s sudden soul gem collapse. They only had an educated guess.

Ryouko had a bit more than that, even if she had chosen not to share it with anyone. She knew the importance of being there when they revived Asami\'s body.

But what would she say? What would she do? She had no idea---she only knew it would be emotional.

\"Ryouko‐chan,\" her father said, again interrupting her reverie. \"You know it\'s not easy for me to say this, but I\'m sorry things had to be like this. I really am.\"

\"It\'s alright,\" she mumbled. She didn\'t want to talk about it, not then.

\"Ryouko‐chan---\"

\"I said it\'s alright!\" she snapped, much sharper than she had intended to.

She found herself looking her father in the eye. They had stopped in the middle of a corridor. Thankfully, there was no one around them at the moment.

\"I---not right now, papa. I\'m sorry.\"

They stood there for a moment, and then her father turned away, and started walking again.

\"Alright,\" he said.

They entered a long hallway, flanked on both sides by nondescript sliding doors. Small groups of technicians hurried to and fro.

\"This is part of the area where we perform revivals‐from‐gem---RFG, in the lingo,\" her father narrated airily. \"Most girls have their spare bodies stored closer to where they happen to be at the front, and revivals are performed at colonial facilities, or starships. However, many have secondary backups here, and when circumstances permit the time, the gems are often shipped back here, since we have superior facilities. In the case of your, uh, friend, her clone simply wasn\'t fully grown by the time she suffered, er, bodyloss, so it was still growing. We were able to, well, accelerate its growth.\"

Ryouko noticed her father\'s hesitation near the end of his narration, but focused on only one aspect of it---it abruptly occurred to her to wonder if her parents knew what kind of friend Asami was, or might be.

*Are they told personal details like this about the people they\'re reviving?* she wondered.

Another thing she had to worry about.

They paused in front of one of the sliding doors, her father looking at her. He seemed worried.

\"At this point, the procedure is almost finished,\" he said, swallowing. \"There have been no significant anomalies noted in the neural architecture, and she has been allowed to reach a sleep‐like state.\"

She nodded, slowly, he nodded back, and they entered the room.

Relative to her expectations, the room was simple---other than the bevy of equipment that characterized a standard medical examination room, there was nothing really of note. She supposed any serious work might already have been done elsewhere.

Well, nothing of note about the physical room, of course. In terms of people, there was plenty to look at: Asami\'s new body, covered by a white sheet for modesty, Ryouko\'s mother, who exchanged nods coolly with her father, a male technician, a magical girl she didn\'t recognize standing in the back, Joanne Valentin, and, of all people, Atsuko Arisu.

\"I am here to observe,\" Valentin commented blandly, at Shizuki Kuma\'s questioning look.

\"Come on, of course I\'d show up for this,\" Arisu said, noting Ryouko\'s dismay. \"Besides, Asami‐chan\'s designated psychiatrist agreed to transfer her case over to me, so I can take care of both of you. Lots of synergy there.\"

Ryouko swallowed, nodding. It was entirely reasonable, of course, but she hadn\'t counted on such an... audience.

Then she realized she didn\'t even know what she was supposed to be doing.

\"Just stand by,\" her mother said, seeming to anticipate her question, hunching over Asami. \"There\'s a process to the wake‐up. We need to run some tests. All that\'s really necessary is for you to be standing over her when she wakes. The good news is, she\'s Magi Cæli, so we don\'t have to explain anything, and she\'ll have simulation experience.\"

Her mother paused, glancing at the technician behind her, who was deeply engrossed in the monitor in front of him, and even had a wire running from the device to one of his wrist uplink ports---wired connections were rare outside of the most delicate of tasks.

The technician\'s head shifted slightly, turning to look at Nakase, who nodded.

She lifted the front of Asami\'s sheet, peered underneath, and seemed to fiddle with something, probably one of the many leads running to and from Asami. Ryouko felt a twinge of discomfort, but forced it to pass---her parents probably dealt with so many of these cases that it was just another body to them. She hoped, anyway.

Her mother gave the technician a thumbs‐up, and the man turned back to his monitor. Then Nakase waved Ryouko forward.

She stepped forward only tentatively, so her mother grabbed her hand and led her over to the front of the bed.

Ryouko looked down, at Asami\'s head resting on the provided pillow. Laying there, default shoulder‐length hair spread out over her collarbones, bulky black spinal interface cable gripping the back of her neck, she looked strangely small, and vulnerable.

She met her mother\'s eye, then not sure what else to do, knelt down, so that she was eye‐level with the peacefully‐sleeping Asami.

\"Be careful,\" her mother whispered in her ear. \"Her last memory will be of being ejected into space. She might not wake up calmly. Don\'t worry, though; her TacComp will keep her from overreacting too much.\"

\"Is everything green?\" her mother asked, standing up before Ryouko had a chance to ask for details.

\"Yes, I\'m not sensing any issues,\" the magical girl standing in the back intoned. Though she didn\'t look up, Ryouko was surprised---she had no idea why the girl was here.

\"My monitors are green,\" the male technician said.

\"Then do it,\" her mother said.

For a long moment, nothing seemed to be happening---but then Asami stirred, turning her head slightly, her lips opening slightly to suck in a breath.

Then the girl\'s eyes snapped open, and she jerked forward slightly off the bed, faster than Ryouko could think to respond.

Ryouko\'s mother was already there to catch her, apparently long practiced at this sort of thing.

\"Easy, easy,\" she said. \"It\'s alright.\"

Ryouko was there a moment later, just in time to see a wave of confusion pass over Asami\'s face, as her TacComp temporarily paralyzed her muscles. A moment later, Asami relaxed, apparently having processed the situation.

Then she spotted Ryouko.

\"Ryouko‐chan?\" she asked, incredulous, trying to sit up. \"How---\"

\"It\'s okay,\" Ryouko said, grabbing the girl\'s bare shoulders. A part of her noted sardonically that the modesty sheet was clinging tightly to Asami---it was probably programmed to.

\"It\'s alright. I\'m here for you,\" she repeated, a moment later.

The reassurance fell from her lips far more smoothly than she would have ever given herself credit for, but what surprised her more was how much she meant it. In this time of turmoil, seeing Asami\'s familiar face meant more to her than she would have ever expected.

Asami\'s trembling eyes met hers.

\"You\'re supposed to be dead,\" she said.

Ryouko tried to stabilize herself.

\"Reports of my death---\" she began.

She never finished the quip, though, because she was abruptly struck by a wave of unexpected mirth, one that she was helpless to stop, so that she found herself laughing, clinging to Asami\'s slender body like the only rock in a river threatening to wash her away.

\"It\'s okay, Kuroi‐san,\" she heard Arisu say behind her. \"Leave them alone for now.\"

\"Are--are you alright?\" she heard Asami ask, understandably confused.

Yes, Ryouko thought. The past day, she had felt her previous life, the one she had almost literally wished *not* to have, crumbling away, and in its place, she had---what? Uncertainty, a life where she was jerked back and forth, accomplishing great things, yet feeling no agency.

She had wished to find her place in the universe---she had imagined that there would be an actual, tangible *place,* that she would not be left adrift, as she increasingly felt. Perhaps she wasn\'t there yet; perhaps she was supposed to *find* this place, and she simply hadn\'t yet, but at the moment she wanted something she could count on.

She had thought that her home would always be there, but as her parents had so signally demonstrated to her, having left, she could never go back. She had to find something new.

And here was something new, something seeking desperately to tie itself to her. She could feel it within her now: she would reciprocate---she wanted* to, if it saved her from floating alone in the wide, wide world.

\"Ryouko‐chan?\" Asami asked again.

\"I missed you,\" Ryouko said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Somehow Ryouko had forgotten about Asami\'s family, who were certainly interested in seeing their daughter again after she had a suffered an unspecified \"critically‐serious\" injury, one that necessitated significant organ regeneration. Only secrecy about the cloning program had kept the family from seeing her as she woke.

Ryouko had forgotten, which meant she was surprised when, a while later, after Asami had stood up, dressed, and been run through a standard set of tests, the two of them had been hustled out the door and down through the building to a family waiting area. Once Ryouko had realized where they were going, she considered staying away, but Asami\'s death grip on her hand convinced her to stick around.

Asami\'s entire immediate family had turned up for the occasion, which meant both parents, her 60‐year‐old brother, and her much younger year‐old brother. As Ryouko\'s mother explained that the "procedure\" had gone well, and that Asami was up and about, the relief in the room was palpable---as was the sense of surprise at *Shizuki Ryouko* herself showing up, almost as if she had walked straight out of their newsfeeds.

Ryouko felt like an interloper, as Asami\'s parents and siblings fussed over her, commenting on her hair and inspecting her skin carefully, for all the world as if they would find a healing surgical wound if they just looked carefully enough. They couldn\'t avoid casting occasional glances at Ryouko, though, and surely they wondered what the meaning was of Asami clinging to Ryouko on the way in. Asami\'s younger brother, for his part, seemed vaguely awestruck by Ryouko\'s presence, taking long staring looks. Her older brother merely glanced at her appraisingly.

Ryouko might have known herself to be oblivious, but even she could tell what assumptions might have been made, and what questions might be asked when Asami was taken home. Indeed, she could tell from her own mother\'s look that she would get some questioning of her own.

She sighed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"...and now my brothers are more protective than ever. *Aniki* keeps offering to use \'his connections\' to keep me at home, and my parents won\'t stop feeding me. They keep saying the food will help me heal, and even though I keep saying my internal diagnostics check out, they won\'t believe me.\"

They were sitting at a table at one of the cafés near Ryouko\'s former school. She had arranged for Chiaki, Ruiko, and Simona to meet them here, but they were late. Ryouko was not surprised---Ruiko always made everyone else late---but the later they were, the more time she had to spend here being stared at by pedestrians. It was strangely unnerving, but she didn\'t feel right using the face distortion device Mami had given her.

*I swear, if a picture of Asami‐chan and me shows up in one of those celebrity forums---*

*Ugh, whatever.*

It wasn\'t all bad. The delay did give her some time to catch up with Asami.

\"I can\'t say I\'ve had the same experience,\" Ryouko commented, stabbing at her slice of strawberry cream cake with a fork. \"My parents are too scientifically‐minded. And my grandfather---I don\'t know what to do about him. He\'s been in such a funk. He tries to be normal around me, but you can tell he\'s suffering.\"

Asami glanced downward at her hands, jewel‐like irises briefly refracting the sunlight.

\"Oh, right, I\'m sorry about that,\" she said. \"I\'m sorry... about everything.\"

\"I think I\'m okay,\" Ryouko said, more or less truthfully. \"I\'m more concerned about you. Is the new---\"

\"I\'m fine,\" Asami said, perhaps a bit too quickly. \"We had training for this in the *MC.* It\'s weird sometimes, thinking that this isn\'t the body I was born with, but it\'s okay, I guess. Although, technically they did manage to recover some parts of my body after the battle and reconnect them. I wish they hadn\'t told me that.\"

Ryouko, too, looked down, silent for a moment.

\"You know, my parents were going to divorce too,\" Asami said, quietly. "I don\'t regret what I did, but sometimes Riki---my kid brother looks at me like an alien. Sometimes, I wish I had somehow erased his memory too. It might make things easier. He idolizes you, though.\"

The last sentence was such a non sequitur that it took a moment for Ryouko to catch the meaning.

\"What?\" she asked, looking up.

\"Oh, yeah,\" Asami said, looking down at the cup of warm tea she was cradling in her hands. \"He asked me to introduce him to you, which is a little bolder than I honestly would have expected. I don\'t think he... quite understands the situation.\"

Ryouko watched Asami for a moment, unsure what to say.

\"Ryouko‐chan,\" Asami said, still looking down. \"You might have guessed, or they might have told you, but I didn\'t have to lose my body. One of the MedEvacs recovered the body, and it was still mostly intact. But when they announced that you were dead, I... I just couldn\'t... my gem destabilized, and the ship ejected my body for my own safety. I thought...\"

A chill crept up Ryouko\'s spine. Asami wasn\'t the type to talk about the MedEvac recovering \"the body,\" or to state that it had been "mostly intact.\" She remembered what it had been like, inside the tank, in her vision.

A moment later, Asami shuddered.

\"I thought you were dead. And then I realized, I don\'t want to be out there. It\'s terrible. But where was I supposed to go? I can\'t stand my family anymore. I keep remembering the way my parents fought, and I can\'t stand how much they love each other now. Isn\'t it crazy? It\'s exactly what I wished for, but it scares me. I wanted to be with you, but then...\"

*Go hug her!* Clarisse ordered, surprising Ryouko out her frozen state of shock.

*What?*

*Do it!*

Without really knowing what she was doing, she jumped up, hovered awkwardly for a moment, before deciding to hunch over and embrace Asami from behind. A part of her noticed that Asami was wearing something scented with vanillin.

\"I don\'t want to go back,\" Asami said, starting to openly cry. \"I don\'t want *you* to go back. Why do we have to do this? The world---\"

\"It\'s alright,\" Ryouko said, stroking Asami\'s hand and incidentally checking her soul gem level. \"I---\"

She thought for a long moment, then closed her eyes, wrenching at some internal lever with a mental effort that was almost palpable, dragging the structure of her mind into a new configuration. She could feel her worldview shifting, just a little, and for a moment it almost disturbed her.

Then she opened her eyes again.

\"I\'ll be there for you,\" she finished. \"What you asked me before: the answer is yes. I\'ll be your girlfriend. Come on, cheer up.\"

She took a moment to rub her head against Asami\'s, watching the tendrils of her hair twitch, then wrap themselves around Asami\'s, wondering what the hell she had gotten herself into.

*I have to say this disturbs me too,* Clarisse thought, shocked and confused. *I did not expect this. It doesn\'t fit with my models of your behavior, for you to be so precipitate. Something is---*

*I don\'t know what to think either,* she thought back. *But I thought...*

\"Ryouko‐chan?\" Asami said shakily.

\"Yes?\" Ryouko asked.

\"I--I---your friends---\"

Ryouko looked up, the world snapping instantly back into focus.

Indeed, her friends were here, Ruiko looking off to one side, Chiaki looking deeply amused, and Simona looking shocked.

No, not shocked...

\"When you said you were bringing a friend, I didn\'t think...\" Simona began.

\"Nakihara Asami,\" Ryouko said, standing up to make the formal introduction, something that was rarely done nowadays, in the age of nomenclators.

There was a round of light bowing, and then Ryouko\'s school friends took the additional seats around the table, a fifth chair wheeling itself over for Simona.

\"Oh, sorry, I\'ll be in the bathroom,\" Simona said, excusing herself.

\"Ryouko‐chan has said so much about you,\" Chiaki said, a smooth lie, given that Ryouko had told her practically nothing about Asami.

\"Oh, uh, really?\" Asami asked, innocently. She was clearly a little shook up, but at least the tears had been cleaned away quickly and---oh God, was she blushing?

\"What\'s it like, in the military?\" Ruiko asked, leaning forward.

\"Oh, it\'s, uh, alright, I guess,\" Asami said. \"I\'m in the, uh, space corps, so things are a little different for me. The suits look a little silly when you\'re wearing them, but the scenery is great.\"

Ryouko watched her out of the corner of her eye.

*If you don\'t want to talk about it, I\'ll change the topic,* she thought to Asami.

*I think I\'m okay,* Asami responded, with a trace of uncertainty.

\"What rank are you?\" Ruiko asked. \"I hear Ryouko is a Captain now.\"

\"I think *everyone* has heard that,\" Chiaki said, a little reproachfully. \"Asami is probably still a Second Lieutenant. I\'m guessing you don\'t get promoted this early unless you save the world or something.\"

Ryouko smiled sheepishly at the obvious reference.

\"Yeah, that seems to be true.\"

\"How was it?\" Chiaki asked, waving her hand vaguely. \"You know, the mission.\"

For a moment, Ryouko remembered all that had happened, the events flashing before her eyes. Meeting Clarisse, Eva dying in front her, the sniper she had killed, Misa sacrificing herself, her visions---

\"It was pretty harrowing,\" she said, \"but I got to meet some interesting people.\"

Chiaki nodded. Ryouko and Asami shared a look, and they didn\'t need some mystical \"couple\'s connection\" to understand each other: there were some things that just couldn\'t be conveyed, even if they wanted to. Was this what it was like, coming home, talking about things that seemed so mundane in comparison?

\"They might be making a movie about it, apparently,\" she added.

\"Oh really?\" Ruiko said. \"How exciting!\"

\"Yeah I\'m going to talk to them about it later,\" Ryouko said.

Chiaki cleared her throat lightly, getting their attention.

\"Look, Ryouko, I, uh, was sorry to hear about your grandmother, and your parents. I don\'t know how to say this, but if you need a place to stay, I\'ve talked with my parents---\"

\"No, it\'s okay,\" Ryouko interrupted. \"It was amicable.\"

She had, of course, informed Chiaki about her circumstances earlier. It was just like her, to go out of her way to try and cover for Ryouko, even if it was just in case.

There was a brief moment of silence, as all four of them contemplated the situation.

\"Ruiko,\" Chiaki said, \"why don\'t you go check in on Simona? She\'s taking quite a while in there. Check if something is wrong.\"

\"Wrong?\" Ruiko asked. \"What could possibly---\"

The girl quailed under Chiaki\'s glare, then seemed to understand something, face dawning in comprehension.

\"Ah right. I\'ll go make sure she\'s alright.\"

Ryouko watched her as she left.

\"I was wondering about that,\" she said. \"Sometimes Simona worries me. I feel like there\'s something going on with her. She didn\'t seem happy when I first contracted, and---\"

\"Don\'t worry about it, Ryouko‐chan,\" Chiaki said, sighing. \"Let me worry about what\'s happening with her. You just stay the way you are and worry about... wormholes or something.\"

\"She seemed really unhappy for a while there,\" Asami mused out loud. "Do you know what her family situation is like? Maybe hearing about Ryouko\'s parents bothered her or something.\"

Chiaki gave Asami a strange look, then shook her head, chuckling slightly.

\"Oh wow, uh, well to be honest I\'ve never heard anything about her parents. But, as I said, let\'s not worry about it.\"

Ryouko thought about what Simona had told her once, that she hated how her parents fought. At the time, Ryouko hadn\'t thought the comment to be particularly relevant to her own parents, but now, she supposed, they had something in common.

She supposed it was better that she not bring it up, however.

\"Anyway,\" Chiaki said. \"I\'ve taken the liberty of doing a little planning for the rest of the day.\"

The girl reached into her bag, withdrawing one of those old‐fashioned little handheld work tablets she was so fond of.

\"As you know, we\'ve taken the rest of the day off to be with you today,\" Chiaki said, pulling up a calendar on the tablet. \"But I thought it might be fun to pay a visit to the school. They put your picture on the wall, with the other magical girls, and now that you\'re such a *big deal,* the principal wants to do some kind of event in your honor. Even told me to tell you about it. Now, personally, I know you\'d hate that kind of thing, but you know what a stupidly big deal the local schools make out of it. Personally, I think he just wants to take Fukuzawa Anko Academy down a notch.\"

It occurred to Ryouko that Chiaki\'s tablet *did* have its uses, for exactly this kind of group planning, but also that it would be useless in the military, where they could have summoned all sorts of virtual planning interfaces and shared workspaces that would work just as well. She doubted it would matter to Chiaki, though; the girl had a bit of an artist\'s soul, and would probably make some sentimental argument about needing to hold something physical in her hands.

\"Fukuzawa Anko?\" Asami asked. \"Wasn\'t that just another name for Sakura Kyouko?\"

\"Yeah, they decided to keep the name for historical reasons,\" Ryouko explained. \"But anyway, the last thing I want is to have to give some sort of speech in front of the whole school. Oh Goddess, that\'d be terrible.\"

\"Goddess?\" Chiaki echoed, surprised.

\"Uh---\"

\"Well, I\'m sure you can just say you\'re busy or something. But I still think a school visit would be nice. Afterward, I figured we could go eat somewhere for dinner, maybe come back here. When I heard you were coming back, I was thinking we\'d do another sleepover at your place, but that seems like it\'d be inconvenient now. I think my parents would be okay with doing it, though.\"

Ryouko blinked at the torrent of words from the usually stoic Chiaki, wondering what had gotten into her.

\"Well, actually,\" Ryouko said, prompted by a reminder from Clarisse, "why don\'t we go somewhere a bit more upscale for dinner. I\'ve got a lot of Allocs now, and I don\'t know how to spend it all. It\'ll be my treat.\"

Chiaki twisted her lip slightly, considering it.

\"Okay, I don\'t see why not. Are you coming, Nakihara‐san? I don\'t want to force you if you have anything planned---\"

\"No, no, sure, I\'ll come,\" Asami said, waving her hands. \"I\'d be glad to. And you can call me, uh, Asami.\"

\"Sure, Asami‐chan,\" Chiaki repeated. \"I\'m glad you\'re coming. I want to see what kind of girl could win Ryouko‐chan\'s heart like that.\"

It was said so matter‐of‐factly that it took a moment for Ryouko and Asami, who had managed to forget that topic entirely, to process what she had said. Asami blushed instantly beet‐red, which had the effect of forcing Ryouko to keep *her* composure under control, since, well, she felt one of them had to.

\"I, well, uh,\" she began, not exactly coherently, but then she spotted rescue, in the form of Ruiko and Simona reappearing from the restroom.

\"Apparently, her parents called,\" Ruiko said, strangely quiet.

Then the girl glanced at their faces.

\"Is something wrong?\" she asked.

\"Everything is fine,\" Chiaki said. \"Mostly.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko was sure something wasn\'t \"fine\", at least when it came to Simona, but, as Chiaki had insisted, she tried not to worry about it. Other than that, the rest of the day was actually quite enjoyable. It was soothing, in a way, to lose herself in the kinds of civilian concerns she had disparaged as so mundane. They had dodged their way through the school hallways mid‐class, mostly avoiding the crowd of celebrity gawkers which would have inevitably developed otherwise. Ryouko had no desire to mingle with a crowd of acquaintances who were suddenly fascinated by her life story, and Chiaki had made sure it wouldn\'t happen. They even managed to successfully dodge any encounters with the school principal.

There was one odd occurrence that night, though, which stuck in Ryouko\'s mind for a while. She had asked Clarisse for advice on a suitable restaurant, and the device had performed quite well, choosing a restaurant that, as it turned out, catered heavily to the mages of the MSY Corridor. Yes, the food was a bit expensive and, in Ryouko\'s mind, pointlessly elaborate, but it seemed the restaurant was used to catering to minor and major celebrities, and Ryouko was rapidly hustled into a private booth. The clientèle of the restaurant admittedly turned their heads to look at her, but did not openly stare.

They did stare, however, when a certain Mitakiharan Incubator, which went by the nickname Kyubey, nonchalantly strode through the front door of the restaurant, passed a row of tables, and jumped onto Ryouko\'s lap. It was awkward, since only some of them could see it, and Simona seemed disturbed by its presence.

Kyubey claimed it was only there to visit her, but didn\'t Incubators always have ulterior motives?

It even stuck around for the sleepover afterwards, and it seemed, perhaps less than surprisingly, that Incubators were not good at catching hints. The alien made several off‐color comments about irrational human emotions and how illogical same‐sex relationships had been before reproduction was possible. That was sufficient to earn the beast an unceremonious ejection from the room, Ryouko herself doing the honors of picking it up by the forelimbs like a cat, dropping it outside the door, and locking the door behind her.

At the end of day, they were obliged to spread out throughout the flat to sleep. Some creative rearrangement of the modular furniture provided two extra sofas to sleep on, which still wasn\'t really enough to provide for five people. Ryouko and Asami could have simply ducked out, since they didn\'t *need* the sleep, nor were they likely to sleep a full night---the very concept seemed strangely alien now.

But, out of a sense of camaraderie, they tried, volunteering to use the floor. After some hesitation, Asami cuddled up against her, which she accepted, taking the opportunity to intertwine their hair again. A heart‐warming gesture, yes, but she also secretly found it amusing.

It was surprisingly pleasant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Are you sure I should be here?* Asami relayed, asking the question for what must have been the twentieth time.

*I told you not to worry about it,* Ryouko insisted. *I didn\'t want to be here alone.*

*I guess,* Asami said, looking around nervously, at Ryouko\'s parents seated nearby, and at the woman giving an oration on the podium. A former comrade‐in‐arms, the woman had apparently fought together with her grandmother for years.

Ryouko understood Asami\'s discomfort, though; in her shoes, she would have also found it awkward to attend a funeral for a person she didn\'t know. But, Ryouko wanted company, and she felt she could be a little unreasonable.

It was a small, intimate affair, held in a local funeral home which catered primarily to the families of military personnel---as all such funeral homes pretty much had to, nowadays. There were just over a dozen people in attendance---mostly immediate family, some military friends who happened to be in the area, and a few of the other \"old folks\" that had known her grandmother in life, even if only barely. Ryouko had not been sure her father would attend, given the circumstances, but he was here, along with both of *his* parents. She supposed it made sense; he had lived with his mother‐in‐law for years, after all, and had never been on particularly bad terms with her---or at least, not any worse than the terms Nakase had had with her. Plus, his parents had been on positively great terms with Nakase\'s parents; her grandfather had made a habit of staying over, every few months or so.

It was all so painfully *amicable.*

There were, however, two anomalies on the guest list.

Kuroi Kana was probably the easiest to explain. Kana was, after all, directly related to *Kuroi* Abe and had vouched her intention to reconnect with this branch of the family. Ryouko also supposed that it probably didn\'t hurt for Kana to try and get on her good side, though she got the impression the matriarch wouldn\'t be so crass as to try and influence her at a *funeral.*

Atsuko Arisu was a little tougher to explain. She was supposedly Ryouko\'s psychiatrist, of course, but the situation didn\'t exactly seem to warrant---

A memory struck her, interrupting her train of thought. Weeks ago, just before she had left, before, there had been another party, for her departure, and Arisu had appeared, even when there had seemed no need to. She had thought about it, before she had been interrupted by Kuroi Nana\'s arrival.

It took her a moment to realize that the memory had been inserted by Clarisse. At the time, they had considered the possibility that---

*Do you really think she\'s related to me somehow?* she thought, asking Clarisse.

*She keeps turning up at these family functions,* Clarisse thought. And, come to think of it, you\'ve never asked your parents if they know who she is. They\'ve never seemed bothered by her presence.*

*It couldn\'t be that simple, could it?*

*It couldn\'t hurt to ask.*

Ryouko glanced at her mother, seated at her left, casually three spaces away from Ryouko\'s father, seated on the other side of Asami. She bit her lip in frustration. She couldn\'t ask out loud, not in the middle of a funeral oration, and as a civilian, her mother couldn\'t simply receive relayed thoughts---it depended on her mother checking her messages explicitly, something she doubted her mother would do at the moment. She would just have to wait politely.

Unless...

She turned her head again, craning her neck so she could see Kuroi Nana, seated to her mother\'s left. The two women seemed incongruous sitting side‐by‐side, one merely a teenager and the other clearly older, but they had identical postures, heads bowed in either memory or thought.

Ryouko spent a moment mulling over whether to call the woman "Nana‐san\" or \"Nana\" or what, before using telepathy to ask:

*Auntie, I\'m sorry to bother you, but do you know why that woman in the back is here? Atsuko Arisu.*

The girl looked up, first at her, then at the back of the room, where Arisu was seated.

*Oh, that\'s right; it\'s not officially mentioned,* Nana thought. Well, she\'s my mother\'s grandmother. Distant relative for you, but she has every reason to be here.*

Ryouko didn\'t have to fake the astonishment that crossed her face.

*Our family tree is pretty obscured,* Nana thought. *I\'ve never really been sure why myself. I gather it has something to do with Unification Wars history. If it bothers you, take it up with the Matriarch herself. She\'s here, after all.*

Nana tilted her head, gesturing at the matriarch two seats to her left, then turned back to face the speaker. Ryouko\'s grandfather was seated between Nana and Kana, and despite all that happened to the family over the years, the two of them seemed to be doing a decent job of comforting him---he had broken down a bit earlier.

Ryouko was left at a bit of a loss.

*I guess that\'s one question answered,* Clarisse thought.

*How can she be related to me and still be my psychiatrist?* Ryouko asked. *Isn\'t that some sort of conflict of interest?*

*Not if the system doesn\'t know about it, I suppose,* Clarisse responded.

*Why didn\'t she* tell *me?* Ryouko asked.

*She probably didn\'t think it was that important,* Clarisse thought. Besides, you were bound to eventually find out. Seems reasonable enough.*

In truth, Ryouko was a bit incensed, but didn\'t know what she was supposed to say. She thought about asking Kana or Arisu directly, but it seemed... well, an inappropriate moment.

*Is something wrong?* Asami asked, looking at her curiously.

*Ah, nothing,* Ryouko thought, since she had no idea how to explain it. Just some family conversation.*

*Your family has so many magical girls in it,* Asami thought. *It\'s kind of amazing.*

*Yeah, I guess.*

*Amazing is one way to describe it,* she thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I met her a few decades into my practice,\" Kuroi Abe said, voice strong and surprisingly firm, leaning slightly over the podium. \"This was back when clinical immortality was still a bit new, and required occasional maintenance, especially for the older folks. She came in one day---I remember being impressed by the way she carried herself, the exotic curve of her back. She looked a bit older than most people you meet---her systems needed retuning, and she was due for an upgrade anyway. I was no longer a young man, but I remember thinking, as we flirted, that she was old enough to be my mother, and I was crazy to consider the possibility.\"

\"She quit being my patient, of course, since that really isn\'t alright, and we started dating. She told me about her life, about the War, and I remember the sense of tragedy that I felt---that I still feel. She\'d lost friends to the war---lovers, even, and I had been her first try in a long time. I wondered what it was she saw about me.\"

\"Sometimes we\'d walk along the river, and she\'d just stop and stare, far out at the water, and I would wonder what she was thinking about. She told me that she could never forget the past but, now that it was gone, she could try her best to make a new future. She wished that, with all her extra years of life, she might find happiness.\"

\"And we were happy, for a time. My family was not exactly happy about our marriage, but I was long past caring. I remember our wedding, just the two of us, with no family anywhere---that she knew about, anyway---and then we had a honeymoon in Brazil, where her mother was from. She had never been there, and we spent a month touring the ruined rainforest. Her mother had lived in the favelas there, long ago, her father a foreign aid worker, but other than that, her mother had refused to ever say anything about her past. I could tell that she wondered.\"

Here Abe took a deep breath, seeming to steady himself a little.

\"I wish... I wish things had gone better after that, that circumstances and fate had not been so cruel to us. I wish that the past had not haunted her so. I do not begrudge her her choice to leave, but I am an old man now, and she was... all that I had. I can only try to move on, and see what my eternal life now has in store for me.\"

\"Thank you.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the eulogies had been given, they were given an opportunity to walk up to the coffin, to pay their respects. Her body had never been found, so it was purely symbolic---they didn\'t even have any ashes that they could keep.

Standing there, in front of the casket with its white flowers, in the formal clothes she rarely wore, Ryouko felt a sense of tragedy. She had never known her grandmother particularly well; the eulogies given by her mother and grandfather described a warm and loving woman, one riven by conflict and tragedy. But for all the relevance it had to her, they might as well have been describing a stranger. Ryouko could not bring herself to feel saddened at the death, not directly; instead the sense of loss she felt was of lost opportunity, of missed chances. All she had were a few memories, and a moment on a riverbank, long ago.

*It\'s strange, isn\'t it?* she thought. *With immortality in hand, it\'s so easy to forget what death even means. Yet here I am, and I can\'t feel a thing.*

She sighed, closed her eyes in front of the casket as a formality, and turned away, looking for Atsuko Arisu.

Instead, she found a girl she did not know watching her quietly. It was one of the magical girls who had attended the funeral, one of her grandmother\'s friends.

Ryouko moved to walk past her, assuming that she was only here to stare at a celebrity---something Ryouko had gotten a bit used to over the past couple of days---but the girl surprised her by grabbing her by the arm.

*I need to speak with you,* she said.

Ryouko looked at the girl strangely, activating her nomenclator.

###### \"*Akiyuki, Mio*\" 

-   **Occupation:** *Magical Girl Rank:** *Lieutenant Colonel MG Classification:** *Elemental mage, fire.*

*I\'m sorry; I\'m not very good at this,* the girl said. *But I was a childhood friend of your grandmother. She had a message she wanted me to give you, in case she never got a chance to give it herself.*

Ryouko tilted her head slightly. Quietly, she checked the woman\'s age. At just over three hundred, she was about as old as her grandmother, so it checked out.

*A message? What about?*

*I don\'t know. It\'s encrypted so only you can open it. All I know is that it\'s a memory recording, and quite large.*

*A memory recording?* Ryouko thought.

*Give me a moment,* the girl thought, staring Ryouko in the eyes.

Ryouko looked back into those eyes for a long moment, deciding that, yes, the girl could be *that* old.

*Done,* Clarisse thought. *Recording transferred.*

*She told me it was a secret she\'s been holding onto, that she didn\'t want to go to the grave with her. I didn\'t think---*

The girl turned to face the casket and for a moment, her eyes seemed to glimmer.

Then she turned away.

*Well, I don\'t know what was so important that she couldn\'t tell me, but I\'m done here. I\'ll be seeing you.*

*Wait!* Ryouko asked, belatedly, as the girl traipsed away, ignoring her.

\"What was that about?\" Asami asked, appearing over Ryouko\'s shoulder.

\"I don\'t know,\" Ryouko said. \"But...\"

She looked around the room again, for Atsuko Arisu, but the woman had seemed to vanish into thin air.

*I don\'t know why I can\'t have a family event without ghosts appearing everywhere,* she thought.

\"Give me a moment,\" Ryouko said, sitting down into a convenient chair. "I\'m going to see what this memory recording is. Say I\'m busy if anyone comes looking for me.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She was greeted by the quiet patter of rain, falling on an umbrella.

Memories reconstructed from before the installation of perfect recall implants were always a bit vague, but this world seemed particularly dreamlike, a quality which the gray, overcast sky only contributed to. Details faded in and out of sight: the smooth sidewalk shrugging off torrents of water, a particularly red car passing by, a bright, animated ad for fresh mochi, her mother\'s hand grasping her own.

Her mother---

She looked up, at the slender brown face looking back down at her, from a perspective that seemed to tower far above her. She was tugging at her hand, since she had stopped to gawk at the ad.

\"Maybe later, okay, *filhinha*? Come on.\"

A few pieces of context trickled into her mind. They were visiting her grandfather, who was at the hospital. Her grandfather was a very old man, and very sick. He had always been sick, it seemed to her. Certainly, she couldn\'t remember when he had ever not been.

She let her mother lead her by the hand, away from the ad and into the ornate edifice of the hospital, a building she now realized was in front of her. They went through the building silently, past the automated security desk, into the beautiful, empty elevator, with its bright buttons and clear glass walls.

It only took a moment to reach the room, where the rest of the family already huddled. There wasn\'t much to it---grandmother sat next to the man in his wheelchair, holding the old man\'s hand. Her face, lined and wrinkled, had nonetheless always contrived to make her look young. It seemed impossible that she would ever grow sick, but sad---well, her face looked very sad---

And then there was her father, who had apparently been pacing the room, face grim. He headed over immediately at their appearance.

\"How is he?\" her mother asked, somberly.

\"Not well,\" her father said. \"The cellular damage to his brain is starting to cascade. It can only be a few months now. He wants euthanasia.\"

\"I see,\" her mother said, as the child below her puzzled over the meaning of the sentences.

\"Well, we knew it was coming,\" she said.

\"He wants to see his granddaughter,\" her father said.

\"I know,\" her mother said, pulling her towards the wheelchair. \"Come on, *filhinha.*\"

\"Grandpapa,\" she said politely, and the old man smiled. Her grandmother lifted her into the old man\'s lap, the man held her for a moment, and she squirmed. Truth be told, she didn\'t like being around her grandfather too much---he smelled funny---but he was always kind to her. Plus, it didn\'t seem nice to her to say things about a man who was sick.

Her mother stood in front of her, eyes wide, and a moment later she blinked, the picture taken. Her grandmother put her back on the floor---she was too heavy for him to hold for long.

There was a moment of silence.

\"I asked---\" her grandfather began.

\"I know,\" her grandmother said. \"We\'ll leave now. I hope you know what you\'re doing.\"

And just like that, the others left, the dreamlike quality of the memory causing them to seem to vanish from the room. All that was left was her, blinking in confusion, and the old man.

\"Grandpapa---\" she began.

But then, with a quiet sliding noise, one of the doors to the room opened, and a woman strode in.

No, not a woman.

A girl.

The girl stood for a moment just inside the threshold, seeming to regard the two of them. The girl\'s long black hair, with its red ribbon on top, shifted as she tousled it, and, for just a moment, the girl\'s eyes lingered on her, seeming almost to pierce into her, and she understood why she had mistaken her for a woman.

\"Do they know I\'m here?\" the girl asked, walking forward.

\"No,\" her grandfather said. \"I didn\'t tell them who I was meeting. With Arisu being a telepath I can\'t rule out her knowing, but she generally respects my privacy.\"

He paused.

\"It\'s a bit crazy. They wouldn\'t have listened to me at all if I weren\'t dying.\"

\"Well, there\'s still time to take me up on my offer,\" the girl said.

\"No,\" her grandfather said sharply. \"The last time around, I was young. I wanted to experience more of life. That\'s why I let you pay for my treatment. Now, I have a family, I have children. I don\'t think I should linger anymore. Especially not if it\'s going to cost... resources.\"

The last word was said with a glance at the child, the kind of look that adults got when they were trying to hide something.

\"Not many even know that kind of life extension is possible,\" the girl said, a slight smile quirking onto her lips. \"Otherwise, the demand would be insatiable, for such a limited resource. Atsuko doesn\'t know, for instance. But, think about how she feels.\"

\"I know, and I am sorry,\" her grandfather said, looking down for a moment. \"But I wouldn\'t feel right, staying alive here like a leech. Besides, I\'ve always wanted to meet this sister of mine.\"

The girl smiled slightly at the joke.

\"She insisted that her grandniece be here, you know,\" the girl said. "I\'m not sure why. Maybe she likes that you named her in her honor. I do wish she\'d explain herself to me a little, at least some of the time. Though I suppose she doesn\'t speak to me enough as it is.\"

\"You have a sister, grandpapa?\" the child asked, quizzically.

\"It\'s a joke,\" her grandfather explained, blandly. \"Mind pushing me to the window, Homura?\"

\"If you insist. It\'s a robotic wheelchair for a reason, you know.\"

\"I insist.\"

The girl walked up to the wheelchair and smiled warmly down at her, patting her on the head. She pouted, making an angry noise. She hated when adults did that.

\"Remember when I was young, and I used to call you *onee‐chan?*\" the old man asked, as the wheelchair headed for the window.

\"Please do not remind me.\"

\"I had the biggest crush on you.\"

Homura made a face.

\"I just told you not to remind me. I felt bad for you, you were so awkward.\"

Her grandfather chuckled and the child wondered what was going on in the conversation. The girl and her grandfather were talking almost like equals, and *onee‐chan* was something you called an older sister, but the girl was obviously much younger.

\"Well, thanks for introducing me to Arisu, anyway, though I\'m not sure if I should be thanking my sister instead.\"

They reached the window, the child following behind them.

\"As I recall,\" the girl said, \"the only way I got you to agree to a date was to make it a precondition for your life extension.\"

\"I\'m going to have to talk to her about that. No one likes a manipulative and bossy older sister.\"

\"Even an omniscient one?\"

\"*Especially* an omniscient one.\"

There was a lull in the conversation, during which the child chewed over what \"omniscient\" might mean. Why couldn\'t adults just use easier words?

\"Look out there,\" her grandfather instructed.

She did so, and there arose perhaps the clearest memory of the entire dream.

Mitakihara City looked dank and gloomy in the rain, which fogged the windows with moisture. Clustered around them were the gigantic towers of the hyperclass, shimmering and beautiful in the sunlight, but gloomy now. A bit farther away, the other parts of the city were visible: the robotic assembly plants, the university, the military base, and especially the public housing, derisively called the slums by some.

\"There\'s a storm gathering,\" her grandfather said. \"Things cannot continue as they are. Here, we keep the lower class satisfied, with free housing, free food, free everything, practically, and even then, there is resentment, at the hyperclass, at *us,* lounging around in the lap of luxury. Here we are fine, but what about elsewhere? What about the places where they receive nothing, where children starve in the streets? The kind of place where my daughter‐in‐law was born? What will happen there?\"

Homura was silent for a moment, meeting the glare of the wheelchaired man.

\"Of course there is a storm gathering,\" she said. \"But what would you have us do? We have mitigated things all we can, intervening where we can. Any further and we risk war. The kind of cataclysmic war that could end our race.\"

\"Your MSY is corrupt, Homura,\" the old man said. \"Corrupt, decadent, and lazy. I know what they say, in your halls of power. I know the paralysis that keeps you chained. They just can\'t face the sacrifice that must be made. Not from the comfort of their mansions and boats and tea parties. The hyperclass blights this world, and we\'re part of it, whether you realize it or not.\"

\"Don\'t speak to me of sacrifice,\" the girl snapped. \"You have no conception of the price that must be paid.\"

Her grandfather looked out at the skyline meaningfully.

\"The price must be paid eventually. *That* is the problem. Better now than later.\"

There was a pause.

\"Is that what you called me here to say, then?\" the girl asked.

\"No. Not the only thing. It\'s about Madocchi here.\"

He grabbed the child by the shoulder, surprising her, since she had become nearly motionless, mesmerized by the conversation.

\"Given what\'s coming, what I\'ve seen, I want her to have a normal life. No contract, no MSY, no nothing. I know she\'s at high risk for one, but I don\'t want her to have to see what\'s coming, and I don\'t want her involved. I don\'t even want her to know about the MSY.\"

Homura stared at him, aghast.

\"That\'s an absurd request,\" she said.

\"Well, I\'m making it. Respect this dying man\'s wish.\"

\"Her parents---\"

\"I\'ve already talked to them, and they agree. They don\'t know who I\'m meeting, but they do know what I\'m asking. You know her mother\'s history. Arisu won\'t be happy, when she finds out, but she might not ever learn it was my request. It\'s not that unreasonable, is it, with your influence? Even the Incubators would have to respect a request you make.\"

Homura looked at him, harsh and cold, and it was terrible to see, but her grandfather returned the look levelly.

\"Very well,\" she said. \"But only because it is you. Will that be all?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"Then let me erase her memory. If you\'re really serious, this conversation is too much information for her.\"

Her grandfather looked at the girl askance.

\"You can do that?\"

\"I\'ve trained myself to. It\'s not very powerful, but she\'s a child---her memory is fragile anyway. As long as she doesn\'t receive too many reminders of it, or learn too much of the truth, the suppression should hold.\"

For a long moment, the two adults looked at each other.

\"Alright, do it,\" her grandfather said.

\"It\'ll be difficult to hide my power signature, but I should be able to manage it.\"

The child was already backing away, afraid of the implications of what had been said, but her grandfather caught her by the arm, and the girl raised one hand, radiant with an evil purple glow. Impossibly, the clothes she was wearing seemed to have changed.

\"I\'m sorry,\" the girl said, \"but it will be over quickly.\"

The girl grabbed her by the face with her glowing hand, grasping her skull with the fingers. She was blinded by the light, and pain seared her soul.

The last parts of the vision consisted only of that light, and the voice of Akemi Homura.

\"Do you know what her mother wished for, Tatsuya? I do. I asked her. She wished for vengeance, at all costs. I hope it does not cast all into the flame.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko woke from the living dream confused, head throbbing slightly. The facts had come at her so quickly---that Atsuko Arisu was her grandmother\'s grandmother, she had already known, though indeed she had not known the truth of it. But the rest---her ancestor and Akemi Homura, talking about an elusive sister, one who, in context, could only be one person, or more accurately, one *deity...*

For once, she could put the pieces together. There had been no reason her grandmother needed to be at that meeting, except that a certain deity had asked for it. The memory had been sealed away, seemingly erased, and yet here it was again, fresh for her perusal. It did not seem far‐fetched to her that the reason the memory existed was precisely so that she could see it. Very teleological, but it was hardly surprising that things got teleological with an actual deity around.

One that was, for whatever reason, making it known to her that they were related.

What was it the Goddess had said? That she was born for things? Kyouko had even jokingly brought up something about a prophet.

Descended from a god, used by her as a tool, filled with visions---that sure *sounded* like some sort of prophet. Or at least that\'s how it was in the stories.

She had wished to explore the world, and here she was, exploring parts of it she hadn\'t even known existed. But she didn\'t know if she wanted to be a prophet.

Ryouko felt an irrational anger surge within her. Not at the way her grandmother had been treated, but at those around her. What was she supposed to do with this knowledge? What had been gained by hiding it from her? Why had her family ended up the way it was? None of those accountable were accessible. Atsuko Arisu had left and might not have even known what happened. The old man in the vision was long dead. Akemi Homura was missing.

She let the anger fill her, because it provided clarity. She didn\'t want to think about anything else. There was one person still available she could talk to, one who seemed to have a hand in *everything.*

That person had even said:

\"*Come see me again when this is all over, okay? I expect we\'ll have much to talk about.*\"

Prophetic words indeed. Of course, that was hardly surprising, coming from a Goddess.

She seemed to have a human name, too, one Ryouko knew well. What was it Homura had said?

\"*She insisted that her grandniece be here, you know. I\'m not sure why. Maybe she likes that you named her in her honor.*\"

So, her grandmother had been named after the Goddess. The old man had clearly been related to her grandmother paternally---the ethnicity was a hint to that, if nothing else. Taken together, that implied the Goddess must have the exact same name as her grandmother. That meant the Goddess\'s human name was---

*Kaname Madoka,* Clarisse finished for her, voice a bit shaken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By the time she reached the Ribbon Chamber, the force of her anger had cooled, probably much to the relief of Asami, who she had dragged along---and then teleported---with her practically by main force. She seemed to have frightened Asami, judging by the way the girl kept asking her if she was alright and offering to go buy her sweet beverages.

*I said I\'m alright, Asami,* she insisted, too distracted to realize she had dropped her customary honorific.

They were waiting in line to see the Ribbon, so it was probably for the best she had lost her previous force of will; otherwise, she might have started pushing people out of her way.

*Why are we here? Why are we visiting the Cult?* Asami asked, looking around warily at the mixed‐race, all‐female assemblage of pilgrims gathered in the room. Ryouko had created a bit of a stir with her unannounced appearance and, given the Cult\'s beliefs about what happened at Kepler‒37, it was bound to create additional rumors. The whispering around her was already starting.

She didn\'t care, not at the moment. She *needed* to talk to the Goddess. Funny, that she should show up practically demanding to see a deity who was notorious for only showing up when she chose to, and enigmatically at that. She suspected, though, that the Goddess would show up as expected.

Asami stood there gawking at the stained glass that adorned the room, emblazoned with a hope and despair motif.

*Are--are you religious now?* she asked.

Ryouko wasn\'t sure how she was supposed to answer that. Technically, the answer was obviously yes, given that she was speaking of the Goddess as a reality and even had a little tête‐à‐tête planned with her for later. On the other hand, it felt strange to say, given that the Ryouko of just a month ago would have strongly denied anything of the sort.

She was saved from having to answer by the fortuitous appearance of none other than Kyubey itself, who materialized out of thin air on Ryouko\'s shoulder, causing both of them to jump slightly.

\"Oh, h‐hi again, Incubator‐san,\" Asami said.

*I told you already, it\'s Kyubey,* the Incubator replied, sounding almost annoyed.

\"Oh, right, sorry.\"

The Incubator\'s arrival had caused another stir in the crowd, since Incubators were---well, they didn\'t exactly have an exalted place in Cult theology, so it was very strange that one would appear at the Ribbon Chamber; though, indeed, Ryouko remembered it appearing the last time she had been here.

\"Why are you here?\" Ryouko asked, a bit suspiciously.

*Just here to observe,* the Incubator responded, swishing its tail behind her back. *I am interested in these \'visions\' that seem to interest you magical girls so much.*

\"I see,\" Ryouko said. \"What value could that have to you?\"

*Plenty of value,* Kyubey thought. *Even if the other Incubators disagree.*

\"Incubators can disagree?\"

*It happens, very rarely. In any case, I\'ve been authorized to investigate this matter on behalf of my race.*

\"I\'m not sure I like the sound of that.\"

*I intend no harm.*

Ryouko let the topic drop, subsiding into silence. The line advanced slowly, and she stroked Kyubey\'s tail to pass the time. The creature rubbed itself against her hair, which she used to pet it. It was strange, talking to a creature like a human while at the same time treating it like a cat. The Incubators supposedly didn\'t derive any enjoyment from the rubbing, but they were sure good at faking it.

Finally, they reached the front of the line, where one of the two honor guards was the same telepath she had met last time, with the absurdly ornate hat.

*I told you last time to be careful with your thoughts!* the guard thought. *I* like *the hat.*

*Don\'t you mind‐readers know anything about privacy?* Ryouko demanded.

The guard shifted positions slightly, seeming to think for a moment.

*No, not really,* she admitted. *Anyway, I can\'t say I\'m surprised to see you back here, after the wormhole thing. Ready to convert?*

*Maybe later.*

*I don\'t know what\'s with you. For most people, one vision is more than enough.*

*Is that any way to talk to the \'Savior of Humanity\'?*

*Don\'t let it go to your head, or you\'ll grow a hat just like mine.*

Ryouko snorted, then realized Asami was giving her a wide‐eyed look.

*Oh Goddess, that conversation wasn\'t private,* Ryouko realized.

*You\'ve had a vision?* Asami asked. *Then, it\'s true that---*

*I\'ll explain afterward!* Ryouko pleaded. *After we visit the Ribbon.*

*Oh, I was just reading about that! It\'s a religious artifact that supposedly grants visions. Is that why we\'re here?*

As Asami was asking the question, Kyouko appeared, stepping out of a side door to an area near the Ribbon.

*Oh, this is just perfect,* Ryouko groaned---to herself.

*It seemed like a good idea to show up,* Kyouko shrugged, seeing her looking. *I doubt this visit of yours is a coincidence.*

Finally, blissfully, the people in front of her finished, the forcefield turned off, and it was their turn at the pedestal. Ryouko looked around, then transformed, gesturing at Asami to do the same.

Ryouko took a moment to look at the Ribbon again, the seemingly ordinary piece of cloth enshrined in a transparent box that could probably survive most nuclear weapon detonations.

*What do I---* Asami began.

*Do as I do,* Ryouko instructed, dropping to her knees and assuming a praying posture.

She closed her eyes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko found herself in a field of roses, patterned neatly into row after row. The sky above her was a warm white, seeming to suggest the presence of a sun without showing one. The soil below her feet felt warm and loamy, and she looked down, realizing that she was barefoot, and wearing nothing but a white dress.

She checked herself subtly. Yes, it really was *just* the dress.

\"Is that really a dignified thing to be doing in a place like this? Also, it\'s called a tunic. The Romans wore them.\"

Ryouko startled, then looked around for the source of the voice.

She couldn\'t see it, but she felt she knew which direction it had come from.

She made her way through the garden gingerly, careful to avoid pricking herself on any of the roses. Calling it a garden seemed a bit of a misnomer, actually, considering that there was no visible boundary she could see. Just row after row of flowers, white and pink and red and blue and myriad other shades, stretching off to an impossibly‐far horizon.

She could feel the warm earth sticking to her feet as she walked.

She found the Goddess two rows over. This patch of roses was blood red, but the plant the woman was next to had light green flowers, flowers which seemed to shimmer in the invisible sunlight.

This time the Goddess had taken the form of an older woman, a bit older than the apparent age of Ryouko\'s mother. Instead of the elaborate dresses Ryouko had seen before, this time the woman was wearing only a simple white tunic, same as Ryouko. She had her pink hair tied back in a utilitarian ponytail, and was frowning at a pair of garden clippers she was holding. This time around, Ryouko could pin down why the Goddess looked familiar---she resembled her mother or, more straightforwardly, Ryouko herself. Ryouko could easily imagine her mother with the same frown.

\"It\'s not just that, you know,\" the woman said, without looking up. "Every magical girl finds me familiar. It\'s a kind of racial memory, Jungian unconscious, echo of the future---whatever you want to call it. It\'s just stronger for you.\"

With a decisive snap, she cut the branch she was holding, removing from the plant a single green flower. It had been hanging pendulously from the plant, seemingly too heavy to bear.

The woman smelled the flower, inhaling deeply, then stood up, turning toward Ryouko. She held the flower in front of her.

Uncertainly, Ryouko looked between the rose and the Goddess\'s always‐unnerving eyes. Then, she took the proffered flower, looking deep into the bloom.

The fragrance of the rose was overpowering, and as she watched, entranced, the shimmering green of the flower became even more jewel‐like, the petals seeming to curl together---

\"Ryouko.\"

The Goddess\'s voice woke her from her trance. She looked up at the Goddess\'s jewel‐like eyes, and remembered who this world belonged to.

\"I\'m glad you came back to see me,\" the woman said, smiling warmly. "You have questions for me. Ask.\"

She looked down, at the earth below, intimidated by the woman\'s presence.

\"Am I really related to you?\" she asked.

\"In a sense, yes,\" Madoka said. \"I never existed in your world, but if I had, you\'d be a distant niece. Objectively, that matters very little, other than producing a bit of metaphysical resonance, but sometimes even the most tenuous connection can become a treasure. For most Matriarchs, family is all that is left, and I have very little left to tie me to your world.\"

Ryouko nodded, even as she continued to chew on the meaning of the words. She did not really understand.

\"I am a god, Ryouko, even if I wear a human face. That has certain implications. At the moment, you fear my presence and you fear my gaze, even though you do not understand why. I was human once, like you---part of me is human still. But if any of my old friends were here with you now, they would think me a stranger. Homura‐chan would demand to know what I have done with the Madoka she knew. But the truth is, I *am* her. One cannot live forever and truly stay the same.\"

Ryouko swallowed, nodding again. This version of the Goddess was different than the ones she had met previously. More overbearing, less kind---

\"Less human. Yes, it is true. Sometimes, I can barely remember what it is like to be human. At times like that, my divinity overwhelms me, and I become just the Law of Cycles, just a Law. In the end, that is why I spend the time to focus on my family, on Kyouko‐chan and Mami‐san. I could have achieved my goals in other ways, but this helps me remember. Otherwise, the nature of infinity begins to weigh on me, and every magical girl begins to look like every other, every soul indistinguishable from so many others.\"

\"Why all the secrecy? Why did you allow what happened to my family?\" Ryouko asked, the words seeming to come unbidden to her lips, and the voice that answered her echoed in her heart.

\"Omniscience is a terrible burden, especially when you are also timeless, so that you have infinite time to examine every possible implication, and to perform every possible task. In that kind of situation, you are responsible for every single implication of what you do, and the terrible thing is, no decision is perfect. I only have limited capacity to intervene, and every time I do, everything I do must be crafted exactly. The sad truth is, there is no karma in this world that I have seen, other than what society and I myself have enforced. It is entirely possible for me to save an innocent life, and kill thousands or even millions in the future, and equally possible for me to have someone killed, and in so doing vastly improve the world.\"

\"But even beyond that, it is worth asking: What does it mean to have a better world? If I truly were omnipotent, and could intervene anywhere at any time, would a world where I did everything, and made every decision, truly be better? If, with a hundred visions, I directed the lives of a hundred girls, and in doing so saved a single life, would that life be truly worth saving? Everything depends on the values you choose to apply, and *no set of values is perfect,* not even the one I choose to use. The world was not ready for the existence of our kind, so we were kept secret until it was. In the case of my own family, where certain metaphysical connections allow me to exercise unusual control, events must be arranged with particular care. It is your special burden to bear this, to have less freedom to live your own life.\"

\"Tell me, then: Will you presume to judge me for my actions, when you have no understanding of the implications?\"

Ryouko\'s lip quivered, and the words of the Goddess weakened her, but she forced herself to look up, at those terrible eyes.

\"I---\"

Then, suddenly, the woman was gone, and she found herself looking into the eyes of a girl, the teenage form of the Goddess.

\"It\'s terrible, isn\'t it?\" the girl asked, and this time it was a very human voice, with none of the cadences of before. \"It all sounds so *wrong.* It sounds like the Incubators talking. I hated their logic, and you hated mine. You shouldn\'t bow your head to me, just because of what I am. You feel in your heart what is right, just like I felt in my heart, when I wished this new world into being. That is part of being human, that rebellion. I care about my family, and my friends, and because I do, your world is not as good as it could be. It weighs on me, but perfection can\'t be everything. I have the right to care. It is my right!\"

Ryouko realized, abruptly, that the Goddess was crying.

\"I---\" she began again, reaching out, and the girl disappeared again, replaced this time by a young woman---only a bit older than Ryouko herself, but definitely older.

\"Emotions are what make us human, Ryouko,\" the woman said, reaching out and grasping Ryouko\'s shoulder. \"It\'s what gives us our power, and makes us special. You have heard as much, from the Incubators. It\'s sad, isn\'t it? The universe turns on sterile logic, so it is only natural that the Incubators do the same. Everything must become efficient, reach a final state. It is like entropy itself. Why is the gift confined to only us?\"

Ryouko met the woman\'s eyes, and this time they were warm, and loving. There was no terrible omniscience in them, not this time.

The woman dropped her arm.

\"Well, I suppose that is it for now. You have a lot to think about.\"

Ryouko scrunched her face at the dismissal.

\"Wait, no. I want to ask you: What do I do now? I don\'t want to just hang out on Earth for the next few months. I made a wish to get away from that!\"

The woman giggled, sounding strangely girlish.

\"You think I would tell you, so bluntly?\" she said. \"I want you to live your own life, whatever my plans for you. Things have a way of working out. And you know, you and Asami‐chan make a cute couple, even if there\'s---well, for now, I think things will be fine. You know, I gave her a vision too, since I thought it would be cruel to leave her out. I\'m giving her relationship advice, right now.\"

\"Relationship advice,\" Ryouko echoed emptily.

\"Oh yes,\" Kaname Madoka said, waving. \"Anyway, goodbye now. Don\'t tell Kyouko‐chan anything!\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The material world lurched back into existence around her, without even giving her a moment to realize what had happened. Ryouko\'s eyes snapped open, and she looked up, finding the red eyes of Kyubey looking down upon her, from on top of the box that contained the Ribbon.

Next to her, Asami gasped, and she glanced over, finding the girl looking back at her. She looked awestruck.

Ryouko looked around, and found the crowd staring at her, Kyouko with arms crossed and one eyebrow raised.

Ryouko groaned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Was it really necessary to teleport us straight back to your room?\" Asami asked. \"I know it\'s within your range and all, but---\"

\"I\'m not ready to face Kyouko‐chan, or any of that,\" Ryouko said, lying face down on her bed.

Asami furrowed her brow.

\"Kyouko‐chan? You mean the Cult leader? Why \'‐chan\'?\"

\"Yes, her. And, sorry, my tongue slipped.\"

Asami rubbed her hands nervously, and Ryouko knew she had to say something. A vision could be a life‐changing experience, and she had been dragging Asami around like a doll.

Ryouko sat up.

\"So, what did the Goddess say to you?\" she asked, not sure what else to lead with.

\"I can\'t believe she\'s real,\" Asami said, looking at her incredulously. \"You knew? Do you talk with her regularly?\"

*Yes, apparently,* Ryouko thought, answering the question in her own head---but not to Asami.

\"It\'s complicated,\" she said out loud. \"Anyway, what did she tell you?\"

She was being a bit cruel, buffaloing Asami into telling her about her vision, before Asami had a chance to realize she should ask Ryouko about Ryouko\'s* vision.

Asami rubbed her hands again.

\"Well, I haven\'t been having a good time lately,\" she said. \"I\'m scared to go back into combat, and I don\'t want to leave you, but she made me feel better. Gave me a little perspective. And, uh---\"

The girl cut herself off and looked away. Ryouko looked at her curiously, then realized she was *blushing.*

\"Asami‐chan?\"

\"Well, I, uh---\"

\"You don\'t have to tell me if you don\'t want to,\" Ryouko said, backing off. \"It\'s okay. Let me go ask my mom if we can have some food. Well, not my mom---\"

\"She said if I wanted anything physical from you, I\'d wait forever, so I have to be the one to bring it up.\"

Ryouko peered at her.

\"What?\" she asked.

*While I hate to interrupt,* Clarisse thought, transmitting the thought to both of them. *I feel I should stop this now, and point out that you have surprise visitors. They just pinged you to check if you\'re available.*

Ryouko pushed the previous conversation forcefully to the back of her mind.

*Joanne Valentin and Shizuki Sayaka?* she thought, incredulously, responding to them in the affirmative.

She bustled outside, where her father was hastily trying to make the front room look presentable. She did what she could to help him, and Asami appeared behind her a moment later.

\"*If I may ask,*\" she relayed to Sayaka. \"*What is this about?*\"

\"*Well,*\" Sayaka texted back a moment later. \"*We have a proposal for you.*\"

## Interlude Ⅱ: Madeleines 

> And so it is with our own past. It is a labour in vain to attempt to recapture it: all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile. The past is hidden somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach of intellect, in some material object (in the sensation which that material object will give us) which we do not suspect. And as for that object, it depends on chance whether we come upon it or not before we ourselves must die.

And soon, mechanically, weary after a dull day with the prospect of a depressing morrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake. No sooner had the warm liquid, and the crumbs with it, touched my palate than a shudder ran through my whole body, and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary changes that were taking place.

But its struggles are too far off, too much confused; scarcely can I perceive the colourless reflection in which are blended the uncapturable whirling medley of radiant hues, and I cannot distinguish its form, cannot invite it, as the one possible interpreter, to translate to me the evidence of its contemporary, its inseparable paramour, the taste of cake soaked in tea; cannot ask it to inform me what special circumstance is in question, of what period in my past life.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Where is she?*\"

*The soldier peered nervously at her from his position of attention. His eyes had the characteristic strained, yet relieved look of a man experiencing post‐combat recoil, one who was finally out of his armored suit.*

*He hesitated, weighing how to say it.*

\"*I\'m sorry, sir. We tried, but it was hopeless. We held the position as long as we could. No one else made it out. I filed a report---*\"

\"*You\'re not listening to me.*\"

*Her voice came out soft, with only a hint of a growl, but its intonation was enough to stop the trooper cold. He stared at her, eyes wide, and took a slight step backward.*

\"*Sir,*\" he said, swallowing as subtly as he could. \"*Your gem looks dim. Don\'t you think it\'s time you recharged it?*\"

\"*You have no right to tell me what to do.*\"

\"*Sir,*\" the soldier repeated, stiffening his spine. \"*Rank or no, if you\'re experiencing instability, I am not obligated to listen to you.*\"

*His voiced softened slightly.*

\"*Please, we\'ve all lost someone. My entire platoon is dead. All of them. But we have to deal---*\"

*His sentence ended with a strangled noise, as her telekinetic grip clamped down on his throat.*

*Easy. So* easy *to apply a little more force and crush the neck entirely, reinforced windpipe or no. So* easy *to take out her anger on a target who certainly didn\'t deserve it.*

*She still had a little rationality left, it seemed. Perhaps it was the influence of her TacComp, which was straining with all its electronic might to keep her sane, keep her under control. It had been a mistake to allow her to exit emotional suppression---now, it had no way to reverse that decision.*

\"*Bring her back,*\" *she whispered.*

*The man looked at her, his eyes filled with fear, as he futilely tried to reach for her with his arms, which he found to be restrained with ineffable force.*

*She raised her own arm, and the man lifted into the air, struggling.*

*She wanted to scream in anger, but instead what came out was a broken, shaking plea:*

\"*Please, bring her back. I can\'t live like this.*\"

*The man flailed in the air, his face definitely* not *the face of God, his strangled voice certainly incapable of giving her the answers she sought.*

*She could see around her the horrified faces of the other soldiers and technicians, flattened against the wall either by fear or by her telekinetic bubble. That personal bubble of space---a small radius within which her magic could warp reality---had served her well over the years; granting her access to all sorts of powers. All it took was a bit of preparation, and she could be a teleporter, or a mind‐reader, or a telekinetic---just not all at once.*

*At the moment, it felt as useless as ordering a single magical girl to hold back a full alien division.*

*She screamed, and hardly even heard herself; the walls of the room around her fractured as pieces broke off, crumbling like her heart had in the moment she had heard the news. Her surroundings blurred in a torrent of tears, and a small part of her wondered just who was in control of her actions, her powers---because it certainly wasn\'t* her. She felt something crack inside her, fall apart bit by bit, and she wondered---*

*A loud popping noise, and the painful grip of someone\'s hand on her head, brought reality rushing back in.*

*She only had a few moments to see the frightened face of the teleporter that had appeared next to her, and the determined, serious expression of the telepath in front of her. Elfrida Vervloet, her name was, one of the division\'s psychiatrists; the one who she had told just hours ago that she was fine. Not particularly powerful, or the telepath would have noticed something* was *wrong with her, and wouldn\'t have needed direct contact to exert her mental control.*

*She had training to resist mind‐control, obtained along with her promotion to Colonel, what felt like a lifetime ago. She didn\'t use it, though, even as the hand on her face began to glow brightly yellow, and she felt the telepath\'s suggestions edge their way into her own thoughts. So much easier to just give in, let someone else do the thinking. Yes, sleep, that sounded like a good---*

Shirou Asaka woke gasping, kicking her legs abruptly. She grabbed wildly with her arms, taking only a moment to find something to cling to---the girl next to her, the one whose face was pressed into her neck. There was only a moment of confusion before memory returned to her, along with a warm, soothing certainty.

Alice Lynwood, whose hair teased her chin, whose smell filled her nostrils, and whose... body was pressed against her.

The girl stirred, disturbed by Asaka\'s waking, and made a displeased noise.

\"That dream again, Asaka?\" she sighed. \"I wonder what\'s going on with you.\"

\"That dream\" had been plaguing her for months now. Each night it was slightly different, and each morning she lost most of the details. It was frustrating; she would have ignored it had Alice not nagged her endlessly about getting it checked out. She really wasn\'t enthused about seeing a shrink, but she had eventually agreed.

\"You don\'t have to nag me about it,\" she said. \"We\'ll find out what\'s going on; it\'s probably nothing. Come on, let\'s talk about something more fun.\"

She gave the other girl an experimental squeeze, causing her to squirm.

\"Oh, you,\" Alice said, rubbing herself against her playfully. \"Not that I\'m against the idea, but honestly, if there were ways to make having kids be more *fun,* I probably would have talked you into it already.\"

Asaka, who had been in the process of saying something, choked in surprise instead.

\"I\'m not sure we\'re ready,\" she said, recovering. It was the familiar cadences of an old argument.

\"You know we are,\" Alice rebutted. \"You\'re just scared.\"

Asaka closed her eyes, accepting for the moment the half‐playful, half‐serious teasing. Children, she thought. Alice would inevitably talk her into it, and then she\'d have to call her mom---

\"I\'m serious,\" Alice continued. \"Look, they even sell kits now, for making it into an enjoyable exp---\"

Asaka rolled over aggressively, body sliding underneath the sheets, but over* the other girl. It startled Alice into silence.

\"Not now,\" Asaka said, descending for a kiss.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"So how\'s the wife?\"

Asaka lowered her binoculars for a moment to glance at the girl next to her, then raised it again, peering at the town in front of her. MadhuritheGreat, or \"Maddy\" to friends, was second‐in‐command of the guild, and one of her most trusted subordinates. Asaka had grown to rely on her in the interguild combat matches that typified this particular game.

Magical Sky, as it was called, was a virtual reality first‐person multiplayer cooperative combat game---VMCC---about an alternate universe where magically‐empowered girls had helped decide the Second World War. As strange a concept as it was, it had become one of the most popular games of its genre, nourishing a fanbase of viewers healthy enough that prominent guild leaders, such as Asaka, could live in luxury---and just as importantly, afford to pay off Governance\'s exorbitant VR usage fees.

She was fond of Maddy, not just because she was reliable, but also because she knew Maddy to be a female in real life---she simply couldn\'t completely escape the vague feeling of creepiness that arose from knowing that a grown male was inhabiting an obviously female avatar. Stupid, maybe, but she had a right to her biases.

And if Maddy\'s in‐game avatar happened to resemble Alice---well, that was probably a coincidence.

At the moment the two of them were on the ground behind a small ridge, faces, green uniforms, and helmets smeared with mud, surveying a small German town just across the river. Various opposition infantrymen, affectionately called \"mobs\", wandered the streets and inside the buildings, obvious in her x‐ray vision, one of the passive abilities of the command class she was playing.

\"Same as always,\" Asaka said. \"Still can\'t get her to play this game much.\"

\"Ah, stop being mad about that, Asaka,\" Madhuri said. \"VR games ain\'t for everyone. I wish I had a boy at home who\'d take care of me the way your Alice does.\"

Madhuri was, in fact, Maddy\'s real name. Asaka used "VioletOverwatch\", personally, but Madhuri knew her real name and used it.

\"I\'m not mad,\" Asaka said. \"I just think it\'d be nice if she joined more often. I miss her.\"

\"Aw, you two are so sweet,\" Maddy said, patting Asaka on the back.

\"We\'re thinking about having a kid,\" Asaka said.

There was a brief silence, while Maddy chewed on the revelation.

\"No shit? Which one of you is going to be, you know, the oven?\"

\"We don\'t know yet. I don\'t want to do it, but I don\'t want to make her do it either. I\'m sure she\'d be happy to, but, I don\'t know, it feels weird I guess.\"

\"Well, it\'s natural to be nervous about it. Listen, I\'ll cover the guild for you whenever you\'re busy with the baby, as long as you name it after me. That a deal? We\'ll throw you two a baby shower---\"

Asaka held up her hand to interrupt her, frowning.

She scanned the town one last time.

\"Something\'s wrong,\" she said, suddenly whispering. \"It\'s too quiet. Where\'s the enemy team? Where\'s the armor? I should have seen something* by now.\"

She chewed her lip for a moment, then issued a telepathic call for updates. Had anyone had visual contact with members of the enemy team, or any armor units?

The responses came back uniformly negative, and she grew seriously worried. It was one thing to be bogged down in heavy combat with the other side---another to have no idea what they were doing. The other team wasn\'t composed of newbie shmucks---if she didn\'t know what they were doing, then whatever they were doing was bad news for her.

\"You\'re right,\" Maddy whispered, realizing the issue. \"Something\'s wrong.\"

They edged away from the ridge, allowing some of the friendly mobs around them to take watch instead, their adjutants appearing out of the bushes to follow them. As they moved, Asaka summoned a magical map of the area in front of her and Maddy, so they could study their disposition for any weaknesses. The terrain was generated randomly, and in this case the river bent away from their side of the map, forming a "v\" that pointed towards them. The town Asaka had been looking at was just across the river on the left side, near the point of the v but not right at it.

They were the team on offense, with extra members and firepower, and they were under a time limit. They had only recently made it to the river, and were regrouping for an assault across it, trying for the double envelopment by attacking from both sides. As such, the team had been divided in half, with Asaka and Maddy on the stronger half facing the town and \"Batty\", the third‐in‐command, on the other side.

\"It\'d be crazy for them to pull back from the river and wait,\" Maddy said. \"It\'s their best natural defense, the key to the whole damn map.\"

\"But we don\'t *see* them,\" Asaka said. \"They\'re *not* there.\"

\"They must not want us to see them,\" Maddy said. \"That must mean---\"

\"They\'re concentrating for an attack,\" Asaka said, finishing the thought. \"It\'s the only explanation. It\'s crazy, but crazy like a fox, if they catch us where we don\'t expect it.\"

Maddy studied the map.

\"But where...\" she began.

Both their eyes fell simultaneously on the center of the map, at the apex of the \"v\", which had only a force of mobs defending it.

\"Oh God, we\'re idiots,\" Maddy said.

\"There\'s still time to fix this,\" Asaka said, jumping up now that they were far enough from the ridge, where they might come under fire. "We need to shift---\"

She was interrupted by the distant rumble of artillery.

They stopped. Asaka nodded at Maddy, who used telepathy to check in on the situation, since Asaka\'s telepathy was still on cooldown.

\"I think we just ran out of time,\" Maddy said, sending her the information. \"They just decloaked in the middle. Infantry, armor, support, close‐in, fliers, the whole works.\"

Maddy peered at Asaka for a moment as she chewed her lip, thinking about it. This game wasn\'t exactly like real war, where it might have been sensible to regroup, defend, and wait for the momentum of the numerically inferior attackers to peter out before counterattacking. They were on the clock---they had to win *soon*.

\"The attack has to proceed as planned,\" she said. \"We can trade queens if we have to---without their artillery and air support, cleaning them up will be easy. And if we stall them, give the rear time to prepare, we might not even have to lose our queen. We just have to make sure we do our attack *fast.*\"

From what she understood, aggressive counterattacks of this sort had not been a common trait of the faction her team was playing---but it wasn\'t as if they got style points for successful roleplaying, so who cared?

Maddy nodded.

\"Should we send someone to help stall?\" she asked.

Asaka nodded.

\"We can move a few members here, since we have numbers,\" she said. "But our dispositions don\'t help. Most of the team is too far to get there in time, and the line is getting shredded too fast. We\'re going to have to sacrifice someone to make a last stand. I---\"

She stopped abruptly, looking at the map in front of them. The planning for this attack had been a disaster, and that was at least partly her fault. By far the two closest girls to the event were her and Maddy---she had tried to keep command close to the middle for simple logistical reasons.

So stupid---she and the guild would have to talk it over later---but that wasn\'t what was bothering her. Something...

\"I\'ll go,\" Maddy said, seeing the thought flit across Asaka\'s face. "You\'re too important to the team, and last stands are easy. I\'ve done them before.\"

Asaka nodded, swallowing, hand shaking a little. She didn\'t feel right, but she couldn\'t---

\"Hello? Is everything alright?\" Maddy asked, a touch of concern appearing in her voice. \"We have to move fast. I need to go now!\"

\"Oh yeah, sure, go,\" Asaka said, looking at the other girl. \"I\'m just---\"

A wave of nausea passed over her. In that blonde hair, those playful bangs, she couldn\'t help but see---

\"Asaka? Is something wrong?\" Maddy asked, and this time the concern in her voice was obvious.

For a delirious moment, it seemed to her that the other girl was Alice---not Alice\'s in‐game avatar, but *Alice*---and the nausea became overwhelming.

She felt herself falling---

〈CRITICAL SIMULATION ERROR〉

She jerked in her chair, the cable leading to the back of her neck somehow managing to stay attached.

She breathed heavily for a moment, recovering, holding her hand to her chest, where her heart pounded strenuously.

\"*Hey, you alright?*\" Maddy asked, through their guild voicechat. "*The stupid server glitched up somehow. I don\'t know if you got the message. It seems like it hit you the worst. You looked like you were about to throw up.*\"

*A simulation error?* she thought with astonishment.

\"*Yeah, yeah, I\'m fine,*\" she subvocalized, speaking into a microphone in her throat. \"*Seriously? A glitch? I\'ve never seen one like this, especially on the live‐watching servers. Those are supposed to be extra‐robust.*\"

\"*They say they\'re looking into it,*\" Maddy said, \"*and we\'re not going to be able to restart the match anytime soon. You want to talk to them about it?*\"

Asaka thought about it.

\"*It\'s fine. They know they screwed up. Tell them it better not happen again or we\'re switching services.*\"

\"*Alright,*\" Maddy responded. \"*This sucks though. That was a good game.*\"

\"*Yeah, although we got pretty close to being spanked. I\'ll talk to the guild.*\"

\"*Alright, boys and girls,*\" she subvocalized. \"*This is bullshit, but it looks like today\'s game is canceled. We\'ll reschedule with the other guild, and we\'ve already made our displeasure known to the server host. Those of you who can, go to the practice servers. I\'ll be taking some personal time.*\"

She then sent a more typical text‐based message to the other guild, followed by another one apologizing to the audience. That wasn\'t strictly speaking her job---guild Marketing and their payment processor would take care of most of it---but she liked to use a little personal touch.

Then she signed off, ordering the interface cable to detach and return to its storage position. She actually preferred a server issue to an issue with her personal setup---personal VR rigs were mind‐bogglingly expensive, and were usually rented. She owned hers and Alice\'s, though, and did not relish the idea of possibly paying to have it repaired.

A movement next to her caught her attention. Her dog, a female American‐style Akita with white paws, had been napping on a cushion next to her VR chair, but was standing now. It watched her, tail wagging---it had probably heard her subvocalizing. Dogs were good at that sort of thing.

They had named it Colonel Fluff.

She leaned forward out of her chair, rubbing it on the neck. It barked playfully, fur twitching happily. Like their human owners, dogs nowadays were heavily enhanced---no one liked having pets that died of old age. However, while physical modifications were relatively common, Governance had strict rules about mental enhancement to pets. Dogs could only be moderately smarter than their unmodified ancestors had been.

Which wasn\'t to say there were no enhancements at all. For example, dogs nowadays had their own canine toilets, and knew how to use them.

Thanks to special implants, they also understood human speech to a reasonable degree, and could make their desires known via little snippets of text. Colonel Fluff wanted to know if she was done, and if they could go to the park like she had promised. It was eager to see the other dogs.

\"Yes, yes, Colonel, I\'m done. Come on. Go get Alice.\"

She patted the dog on its side. It barked happily, then ran out the door with excitement.

Asaka leaned back in her chair. Now that she had been able to think about it a little, the server glitch had unnerved her. Something about it had reminded her of the nightmares she had been having.

If that was what server glitches were like, she never wanted to experience one again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She and Alice cuddled on the grass of the park, watching Colonel Fluff frolic with the other dogs. She was glad it was possible to block reception of dog messages, or at least archive them---there were only so many canine expressions of excitement one could take and still remain sane. Apparently, Colonel Fluff didn\'t seem to understand the concept of restraint in messaging.

It was remarkable, the extent to which it was possible to modify dogs and still have them remain, fundamentally, dogs. She wondered if it were possible that, given enough time and enough subtle changes, they would gradually become so different that they would become unrecognizable to someone from the past.

The question applied to humans, too, of course. Not just in a technological sense, but also in terms of personality. Day by day, you were recognizable as the same person, but it was also undeniable that you changed over the course of years, or decades. Over the course of centuries, was it possible that you would become someone else entirely, without even knowing it? What did that even mean?

It depressed her to think that it was possible that she would change like that, changing who she was without even realizing it.

Shaking her head slightly, she inhaled deeply, breathing in the scent of Alice\'s hair, causing the girl to tilt her head upward on her chest, looking at Asaka with a patronizing expression.

\"Want to play fetch with Colonel?\" Asaka asked. \"We haven\'t been paying much attention to her.\"

Alice shrugged.

\"Alright,\" she said, pushing herself off the grass.

Asaka followed a moment later, reaching for the ball in her pocket and signaling Colonel.

The dog\'s head snapped up immediately, and it bounded over only a few moments later.

\"*Oh boy!*\" it texted. \"*I* love *fetch!!! Mr. Puddles was annoying anyway. Kept asking to mate.*\"

Asaka\'s lip quirked upward. In her opinion, dogs nowadays were a bit too* informative. Plus, she wanted to meet whatever joker in Chronos Biologics had decided that dogs should occasionally text sentences with excessive exclamation marks.

She pulled the ball out of her pocket and tossed it far into the distance. It was one of the fancy models, with a tendency to abruptly change direction.

Alice slipped her arm around her waist, and Asaka returned the favor, now grinning broadly. In the distance, children frolicked in the colorful robes customary on Nova Terra, the native trees of the planet giving way to the skyscrapers of the city of Imperia, framed by a brilliant azure sky. The sun dipped behind one of the buildings, casting the landscape in light and shadow.

The wind blew, and, in that moment, she knew this was paradise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The therapist\'s office was painted a soothing shade of light blue, a choice probably designed to put her at ease.

Asaka didn\'t really know why she was here. She didn\'t really consider bad dreams a good enough reason to see a therapist, but Alice had been so insistent and apparently the therapist, a certain Tanaka Yui, had agreed that it was worth her time.

The woman herself was currently seated in front of her, on the other side of her desk, sipping a cup of tea and making an elaborate show of reading off an old‐fashioned tablet. Her hair was tied in a simple long ponytail, and she looked strangely young, a fact that was only accentuated by the long white robe she wore. It was a local colonial style, and being from Earth Asaka couldn\'t help but think that it looked like some sort of religious wear.

Something about the woman bothered her, though she supposed she was just nervous.

\"So you\'ll be glad to know that the diagnostics turned out fine,\" Yui said, putting down her tablet and looking her in the eye. \"That means there\'s nothing physically wrong with you or your implants. Whatever is going on must be psychological, then.\"

\"I see,\" Asaka responded blandly, not sure what else to say.

The woman smiled amiably, closing her eyes for a moment.

\"Since this problem isn\'t at the moment impeding your ability to function, I don\'t feel there\'s a need to try anything too dramatic. Come over here; let\'s talk it over.\"

Yui got up as she said the last sentence, gesturing Asaka to head over to the side of the room, where next to a window there was a stereotypical psychologist\'s couch, of the sort she had been sure was hundreds of years out of fashion. Was Yui really expecting her to just lie down and start talking?

\"Isn\'t there some kind of implant modification you can do?\" she asked, as she edged reluctantly toward the couch. \"Something that would suppress dreams?\"

\"Traumatic dreams of the kind that your partner described to us are often indicative of possible underlying psychological issues,\" the therapist said, smiling thinly and shooing her towards the couch. \"I would like to make sure there is truly nothing going on before I resort to implant manipulation. With any luck, it will resolve under your own power. Come, lie down.\"

Reluctantly, Asaka followed the instruction, lying down onto the couch, which turned out to be surprisingly comfortable. She would have considered falling asleep on it, except that this was obviously not the time, and Tanaka Yui was now seated on a chair at her side, holding her tablet and a writing stylus.

\"Well then, let\'s begin,\" Yui said, after a moment. \"Tell me in your own words what\'s been going on.\"

Asaka took a breath, buying time to think about what she wanted to say.

\"Well, it began a few months ago,\" she said. \"Maybe in April? I don\'t know how to put it. One night I had a terrible nightmare, the worst I\'ve had. Alice said I woke crying. We thought that would be it, but instead---\"

She hesitated, before continuing:

\"---instead, I don\'t think I\'ve had a good night since then. It varies how severe it is, but I think I always have it. Every night. I don\'t understand it.\"

\"It, you say,\" Yui prompted. \"Is it the same dream every time? That seems to be what you\'re implying.\"

Asaka started to nod, then stopped herself.

\"Kind of, I guess. I have a hard time remembering the details of the dreams, so it makes it difficult to tell. I don\'t remember the same thing every time, and I\'m pretty sure it\'s not exactly the same every time, but it\'s all connected somehow. I\'m sure of that.\"

The woman bit her lip, a surprisingly cute gesture.

\"It\'s strange you wouldn\'t remember much,\" she said. \"If it\'s disturbing enough to wake you up crying, typically you\'d remember the details.\"

Yui paused for a moment, tapping the end of her stylus against her cheek.

\"Well, tell me what you do remember about the dreams, I guess,\" she said.

Asaka turned her head toward the window, preferring to look at the building across the street rather than the therapist\'s unnerving eyes. The truth was, though she had told Alice she couldn\'t remember, she hadn\'t really tried.

Yet here she was. There was no sense in not trying, not when the government was paying good money for her to see a therapist about it.

\"Does it bother you to try to recall it?\" Yui asked, gently, after she had been silent for an extended period.

\"Yes,\" she admitted, even though she knew it probably set off alarm bells in the therapist\'s head.

It disturbed her too, to be honest. She didn\'t...

\"I don\'t know,\" she said. \"I have a hard time grasping the memories. They seem to slip away when I try and I feel... afraid somehow.\"

She was talking to herself as much as she was talking to the therapist, speaking out loud just what it was that bothered her; yet, having done so, she was uncomfortably aware that the truth of those words suggested there might indeed be something wrong with her.

A terrifying thought, that.

She tried to focus, feeling the therapist\'s eyes boring into her, and finally something came to her.

\"It\'s about a war. It\'s always about a war. It\'s like---do you know what I do for a living?\"

She finally turned to look at the therapist again, and found not the penetrating stare she was expecting, but instead a strangely gentle expression.

\"Yes, I do,\" Yui said, her eyes dropping down to her tablet. \"You\'re a gamer. You play war sims. That\'s actually one of my working hypotheses. Some simulation games can be pretty traumatic, even if they\'re virtual.\"

Asaka shook her head to dismiss the idea.

\"I mostly play only one game, and Magical Sky isn\'t all that... realistic. Not in that manner, anyway. I don\'t think I\'ve ever even seen a corpse in the game.\"

She paused for a moment.

\"That being said, the game is what my dreams remind me of. It\'s the only connection I can draw right now. But it\'s... different. More violent. People getting killed. Especially---\"

She frowned. She had been about to say something, but had stopped abruptly, and now she couldn\'t remember what it was. It was important.

\"You don\'t have to push yourself,\" Yui said soothingly.

There was a moment of silence.

\"I have to say,\" Yui commented, frowning at her notes, \"if you insist your video games don\'t have any traumatic content, then I\'m at a loss for explanation. Your description sounds like you\'re experiencing the aftermath of some kind of trauma, but it\'s unusual for you to be unable to remember any of it. Nothing in your file indicates recent or past trauma. Is there perhaps something that is *not* in the file?\"

The therapist wore a serious expression, and Asaka got the impression that it was supposed to convince her to talk, if indeed she were hiding something---but she wasn\'t.

\"Honestly, I don\'t think so,\" she said. \"I\'ve had a pretty comfortable life.\"

\"Tell me your life story.\"

The request was phrased so matter‐of‐factly that it was a moment before Asaka realized what was being asked, looking up in surprise.

\"Don\'t you---\" she began, gesturing at the therapist\'s tablet.

\"I want to hear it from you,\" the woman said, continuing to smile slightly.

Asaka turned her head to face the ceiling again, exhaling. She didn\'t think this would lead anywhere.

She took a moment to compose something suitably biographical in her mind.

\"I\'m not sure there\'s much to say, at least that\'s not already in your files. I was born on Earth, in Kyoto, Japan. I had pretty much a normal childhood, except that my parents thought I was too introverted. It wasn\'t really a surprise, since the doctors had warned them that my genetics would land me pretty far on the path to the old autistic spectrum, but it still bothered them.\"

She figured that, of all people, a therapist wouldn\'t need to receive an explanation regarding Governance policy on genetic modification and human personality diversity. It was something she tended to tack on automatically to forestall the usually inevitable \"Why wasn\'t that edited out of the genepool?\" question that usually resulted. Personally, she was glad it hadn\'t, or she wouldn\'t have been here to think about it.

She paused for a moment to think about it further, before continuing:

\"They tried to push me into hobbies I didn\'t really like, and we had a lot of fights about it. I spent a lot of time in the school gaming club using their equipment. I can go into lots of detail if you want, but it\'s pretty typical stuff. Definitely not war trauma, anyway.\"

The therapist nodded, peering at her tablet.

\"I\'ll take your word for it. We can revisit it later if we see the need. Did you play any particularly violent games back then?\"

\"Not really. You know, most of us aren\'t actually interested in seeing blood and gore everywhere, except for a few weirdos. It\'s an annoying stereotype.\"

\"I have to ask,\" Yui said, spreading her hands in a gesture of harmlessness. \"Continue.\"

\"Well, I was a poorly‐adjusted teenager, as I was saying. There was a period when I was very angry at everyone, but I eventually... worked myself out of it, I guess. I don\'t want to sound sappy, but that\'s right around when I met my wife. Well, I, uh, she was very supportive.\"

She paused, having rammed into a bit of a dead end in her story.

\"And I guess that\'s it,\" she finished. \"There\'s not really much more to say. We graduated from high school and got married. I was already making pretty good money from my guild, and I wanted to get away from my parents, so we moved here. It\'s been quite a while since then.\"

\"Only two years,\" Yui pointed out. \"Though, maybe that does seem like a while to someone as young as you.\"

Asaka frowned. Yes, it had been... only two years. It was so easy to forget. It seemed like a lifetime ago.

\"And you two are planning on having children?\" Yui asked. \"Do you know, ah, who will do the baking?\"

Asaka turned to stare at the therapist, a look of surprise plastered on her face.

\"Well, yes, probably, but how---\"

\"Sorry, sorry. It was in the information your wife filed when she made this appointment. It\'s important to know if you might be pregnant, since it affects the kinds of interventions we might pursue. Though it probably won\'t affect you at all.\"

\"I see,\" Asaka said, wondering if Alice was going to pressure her into having kids simply by telling everyone in the area they were going to, the equivalent of investing an enemy fortification instead of trying to take it by assault.

Tanaka Yui chewed her lip for a moment.

\"Well, this is the end of our session. I hadn\'t wanted to resort to this, but there is actually something we can do about all this, even if you can\'t remember anything. Do you know anything about dream studies?\"

Asaka shook her head.

\"Well, basically,\" Yui explained. \"We can use your implants to watch your dreams from the outside. I\'d like to make an appointment for you to go to the facility sometime... tomorrow, maybe? We\'ll see what times are available. That way, we\'ll know once and for all what you\'re not remembering. The way it works is, we\'ll record it, and the first one to see it will be you, when you wake up. That way, if you don\'t want me to see anything, you can choose not to show me.\"

She looked at Asaka questioningly, eyebrow arched. Asaka thought about it for a moment.

\"Of course, everything is absolutely confidential; we\'ll provide you with a strict privacy agreement,\" Yui added, as encouragement.

\"I guess I am curious,\" she said. \"And if I get to see it first, I guess it\'s alright.\"

\"Okay,\" Yui said, smiling. \"Let me send you the agreement form.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Thanks again for coming all this way to see us,\" Alice said, smiling pleasantly as she took her seat at the dinner table.

\"Oh, it was no problem,\" Patricia von Rohr responded vaguely, watching Alice rearrange the food on the table with a slightly bewildered expression. The small table in front of them---square, artificial wood---was adorned with a colorful and carefully arranged array of freshly prepared food. Beef bourguignon served as the centerpiece of the meal, flanked by mashed potatoes and a salad of local vegetables, including the fuzzy red lettuce locals always tried to scare Earthers with. Drinks consisted of wine---Burgundy, to go with the beef. Alice was particular about these things, which meant that Asaka had to pretend it mattered to her too.

It wasn\'t exactly the food Asaka had grown up with, but certain concessions had to be made when you married outside your ethnic group, especially when you were almost always the kitchen assistant, not the chef.

Besides, Nova Terra being a Core World, they typically ate synthesized fare, eating cooked food only when it struck Alice\'s fancy to try and make something. It depended on her mood, and whether or not the schoolkids Alice spent her days shepherding had decided to be kind to her that day.

Occasionally Alice tried her hand at something more Asian, but not today. Patricia was a guest, and both Asaka and Alice knew that despite Patricia\'s years of living in Japan, she had never quite reconciled herself to the local cuisine. One downside of synthesizers: it was entirely possible to live decades in a foreign country without touching any food you didn\'t want. Not exactly optimal cultural interchange.

So a salad, mashed potatoes, and beef bourguignon, the last of which Alice always reassured her was \"sort of like Hayashi rice.\" Having had it on multiple occasions, she supposed it wasn\'t terribly off the mark.

\"I\'ve always wanted to take a vacation out here,\" Patricia explained, unfazed by the fuzzy red leaves in the salad as she moved some of it onto her plate. \"And it\'s not that far, really.\"

\"How long did it take you to get here?\" Asaka asked.

\"Two weeks by commercial vessel,\" Patricia said. \"It wasn\'t that bad, I swear. They had lots of amenities. Not as fast as being on a military vessel, but...\"

\"You\'ve been on a military vessel?\" Asaka asked.

\"Haven\'t you?\"

\"No,\" Asaka responded instantly. \"I, well...\"

\"I suppose two weeks is still faster than how *we* got here,\" Alice said, getting up from the table. \"But we didn\'t have to go both ways.\"

\"Ah, well, you know how it is,\" Patricia said. \"Work schedules on Earth aren\'t very strict. Oh, and you didn\'t have to do all this, not when I\'m infringing on your hospitality by staying here.\"

The last sentence had been triggered by Alice reappearing from the kitchen with a pot of white asparagus soup.

\"Nonsense, we have plenty of extra space,\" Alice rebuked, setting the pot down, \"and the food wasn\'t really much trouble at all. This is all pretty easy stuff.\"

Asaka smiled, and sipped at her wine. It was true that they had much more living space to themselves than would have been typical on Earth, and it was also true that the food Alice had made wasn\'t *too time‐consuming---but the real truth was that Alice was eager to test her ability at playing host, whether she admitted it or not.

Left on her own, Asaka doubted she would have settled down as rapidly as this, but life was unexpected, sometimes.

\"I just hope you don\'t intend to do this every day I\'m here,\" Patricia said, \"or I\'m going to have to insist on helping with the cooking and, for all of our sakes, let\'s hope that doesn\'t have to happen.\"

Alice shook her head amusedly.

\"Of course not. Tomorrow we\'ll be back to bread and water. But what kind of friends would we be if we didn\'t hold a celebratory dinner for your arrival?\"

Alice held up her wine glass, and it took a moment for the other two to realize what she was doing.

They held a toast to a \"new life.\"

\"So how is the gamer life going?\" Patricia asked, masticating on a piece of beef.

\"Oh, not bad,\" Asaka said. \"The guild is growing, we\'re winning games, we have viewers. Can\'t really complain.\"

\"Sometimes I have to join a game, just to nag her into leaving,\" Alice said. \"Though I do admit it\'s not bad as a break, sometimes.\"

\"I can see how some people might be tempted to never leave,\" Patricia said. \"Have you heard? There\'s a new black market implant hack. It\'s quite sophisticated. Accesses some of Governance\'s buried emergency subroutines, and makes it so a properly configured server can suppress any memory. You can forget all about reality, if you want.\"

Asaka looked down at her noodles, twirling her fork to pick up some sauce. Alice had really outdone herself today.

\"Really?\" she heard Alice say. \"I hadn\'t heard of it. Sounds scary.\"

\"I guess I have to be more in touch with this kind of thing, in my line of work,\" Patricia said. \"Governance is not happy about it---it didn\'t want people to know those subroutines even existed. The speculation is that there\'s going to be a major crackdown. I would have thought you\'d have heard of it, though, Asaka.\"

\"I guess I haven\'t,\" Asaka said, shaking off some of the effects of the alcohol. \"Sounds familiar, though.\"

She paused for a moment, looking into her empty wine glass, then poured herself another cup.

\"It seems like you could do some pretty crazy stuff. People unhappy with their lives could try to escape reality, for example.\"

\"I can\'t say that sounds healthy,\" Patricia commented.

\"Definitely not!\" Alice echoed. \"I mean, even if, worst case scenario, you lost someone you loved, you\'d have to deal with it eventually. You can\'t stay stuck in your old life forever.\"

Asaka glanced over at Alice, into those ice‐blue eyes she loved so much. For a moment, they seemed to chill like ice, too.

\"Yeah, I guess,\" she agreed, looking back down at her wine glass.

She took another drink.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Do you still remember how we met?\" Patricia asked, later that night, when they were seated in the living room to chat.

Asaka looked at her, waiting a moment for the memory to form.

\"Oh, yeah,\" she said. \"It was in the school gaming club, wasn\'t it? I forget why you were there, but you said you were studying VR implants, and I knew a lot about them.\"

Patricia smiled shyly.

\"I wasn\'t such a genius back then, so I needed a lot of help.\"

\"It doesn\'t sound very modest to call yourself a genius,\" Asaka pointed out.

\"It\'s crazy, how much better you got in high school,\" Alice said, referring to Patricia. \"It\'s like someone flipped a switch one day, and suddenly you knew how to do everything. On the other hand, I don\'t know what I was doing. I sort of muddled through.\"

Patricia shook her head.

\"Don\'t say that. You worked hard. I\'ve never been satisfied, no matter how hard I worked. Not since...\"

Her voice trailed off, and there was an awkward silence for a moment.

\"It\'s depressing to look at things that way,\" Asaka said. \"It\'s over now, and it can\'t be a loss. I met you there, after all. I don\'t know what I would have done without you.\"

The last sentence was directed at Alice, whose hand she reached out to grasp.

\"You would have been fine without me, Asaka,\" Alice said, squeezing her hand. \"You didn\'t need my help.\"

\"Are you kidding?\" Asaka said, incredulously. \"Don\'t you remember when---?\"

She stopped, having lost her train of thought.

\"When...\" she tried again, still unable to complete the sentence.

She shook her head at herself, confused.

\"Well, in any case, I have some fond memories of the time,\" she said, trying to recover.

\"As do I,\" Patricia said. \"But one can\'t live on memories alone.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Probing: Sector 5a22e. Seeking---**

*It was as if she had to watch everything through a fog. Only a few details ever caught her attention---an explosion here, a chatter of gunshots over there, the sound seeming to come from another world. But, somehow, she always reacted fluidly.*

Open fire! *she heard herself order, and to her far right a thunderous cacophony of small arms and armor‐mounted mortar fire broke the relative silence, resonant and eerie to her distorted hearing.*

*Around her, behind the trees that densely saturated their area, six other teenage girls crouched, dressed in a series of costumes that were more appropriate for children\'s entertainment than an apparent war‐zone. She nodded at them, and they nodded back. Distantly, a part of her noted that one of the girls was* Alice, *but, just then, the fact seemed entirely appropriate.*

*She performed one last mental check, scrolling over the platoons of shock infantry that would be following them in. This she did with a determined grimness that she had never before experienced in* Magical Sky, *yet at no time did it seem unusual to her.*

*The other attack, far to the right, was only a distraction. The aliens were attacking elsewhere, so they were counterattacking, striking at an exposed flank while the aliens were distracted. It was as interminable as the flow of time itself, attack and counterattack and counter‐counterattack, the natural result of their two opposed, yet eerily similar, tactical doctrines. It had a logic and a force of will all its own---they were merely leaves tossed about by the wind.*

*She took a breath, the sound of rushing air loud in her ears, then gave the order to* GO*.*

*They broke out into the open, seven girls charging down a clearing, bold and audacious, even ahead of the drones, for maximum surprise. They ran faster than any human, or even any machine, spurred onward by the accelerating influence of Alice\'s magic, shielded in front by Asaka\'s barrier.*

*Jack‐of‐all‐trades, they had called her, sometimes affectionately, sometimes disparagingly. Capable of doing everything, but good at nothing. She was capable of more than just that, she knew, but there had been no way for the simulations to show it, based as they were on her measured power. She* knew *that she could grow her abilities, that she just didn\'t start with a default power like most girls, but---*

*She discarded those thoughts as they impacted the alien position---literally impacted, as she shoved as much power as she could into her forward barrier, driven forward by Alice\'s magic. Alien infantry and equipment went flying into the air in almost comic fashion, some of it smashed to pieces.*

*The next few minutes were a blur, even by the already stilted standards of her perception. She shielded those around her as best she could with her bubble, casting stronger barriers in specific locations when it seemed needed. She was stuck as barrier generator for now, and she made the best of it, watching for threats, defusing them when she could. The drones finally arrived, pouring into the gap in the alien line they had created, followed by the infantry of their platoons.*

*Then, disaster.*

*An alarm went off. Someone in her operating team was critically injured and required immediate evac---*

\"*Alice!*\" *she screamed.*

*Twisting her right wrist in almost impossible fashion, she spun the dagger in her hand, driving into the hapless alien next to her. The magical blade tore through shield, armor, flesh, and bone, splashing ichor over her already drenched arm.*

*She tore across the battlefield, across the distance that now separated them. She moved faster than any human could imagine, but still felt as if she were running through molasses. She drove her barrier like a wedge in front of her, shoving everything aside, risking everything. Shards broke off her barrier, like glass shattering, but these shards sharpened themselves immediately, flinging themselves outward to impale anything in the area.*

*Why did Alice have to be so damn* fast*? How had she gotten so damn far*?*

*And yet, sooner than she expected, she was there. Alice looked up at her prone on the floor, clutching at a severed leg. The girl was biting her lip, and when she looked up, she showed a moment of weakness, a tear appearing in her eye from the pain---using your implants or your soul gem to suppress pain carried downsides to the precision of your power usage and movements, making pain management sometimes a delicate balance. She had been trying to escape on her own power, a not unheard of feat for a magical girl missing merely one limb---though not quite a common one.*

It\'s okay, *Asaka thought, trying to be soothing despite her emotion. I\'m here. Keep the pain suppressed, and I\'ll get you out.

It\'s armor, *Alice thought.* We\'re not powerful enough to take them on alone, not the two of us. You should---

No, *Asaka growled.* I\'m not leaving you. Come on.

*She bent down to pick the other girl up, draping her over her shoulders effortlessly, even as she tried to be gentle with the gaping wound, even as she tried desperately to look away from it.*

*As she did so, she tried to ask for friendly artillery to hone in around their position, maybe clear a path for them, but she was too far. No one could hear her.*

I can use my magic to help you move faster, *Alice thought.*

Save your gem, *Asaka thought.*

We have to. You can\'t---

*Asaka barely responded in time, throwing up a barrier strong enough to block the laser impact, gritting her teeth with effort as the focused radiation almost blinded her.*

*Then she could sense them, entering the bubble she now had spread broadly around them, stealth tanks hovering silently into range. One of them had taken a shot at her, but the others still hoped their stealth would hide them, oblivious to Asaka\'s barrier---spread so thinly it wouldn\'t have stopped a fly, but sufficient for detection.*

*Asaka felt a quiet anger seep into her. Anger at having her life so rudely violated. Anger that anyone would dare to hurt---*

\"*This is* my *world,*\" *she growled, and the barrier around her---the barrier that defined the range of her powers, and followed her everywhere---crackled to life, angry and violet, glowing with radiant power.*

\"*Get out!*\" *she screamed.*

*The dream warped around her, and a moment later she was no longer in the alien forest, no longer trapped with Alice behind alien lines. Instead---*

\"*I heard about your promotion,*\" *Alice said, looking at her kindly from the hospital bed.* \"*They said no one expected you to have something like that in you.*\"

\"*Yeah,*\" *Asaka said emptily, reaching out with one hand for Alice, who returned the gesture.*

\"*How\'s the leg?*\" *she asked, a moment later.*

\"*It\'ll only keep me here about three days,*\" *Alice said.* \"*It\'d go faster with a magical healer, but there aren\'t enough of those right now.*\"

*She smiled warmly, and Asaka smiled back, slightly. Then she let the smile drop.*

\"*They\'re trying to get me away from you,*\" *Asaka said, looking down at the edge of the bed, the words coming in a torrent.* \"*The promotion gives them an excuse. We weren\'t supposed to be assigned together anyway. It was only because of the exception. The MHD granted one, because they thought I wouldn\'t be okay alone. I\'m sorry I never told you. But now it\'s been long enough, and they\'re worried that if something happens to you, I\'ll---*\"

*Alice squeezed her hand, turning over to try and hug her, an awkward affair with one leg still mostly missing.*

\"*I know,*\" *she said.* \"*They told me about all that. And they told me about your transfer too.*\"

\"*I don\'t want to leave you,*\" *Asaka sobbed.* \"*I can\'t leave you.*\"

\"*I know,*\" *Alice said, patting her on the head.* \"*But they\'re right. You\'ll be okay. We can stay in touch.*\"

\"*I won\'t leave you. I won\'t---*\"

**External Interference! Shutting D---**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the end, Asaka convinced herself to let Tanaka Yui and the dream analysts view the video, but it was a tougher decision than she liked to admit. The dream had no salacious scenes, no dark family secrets---nothing that would justify keeping it locked in her mind.

And yet...

When she had watched herself in the dream, it hadn\'t seemed nonsensical, or symbolic, or prophetic, or any of the other things one might expect a dream to be.

It felt like memory, memory of another life, another world, another existence.

It felt like...

Something about the dream shook her to her very core. It seemed natural,* that she would be some kind of magic user, that she and Alice would fight together in a war, that she would be a...

*Mahou Shoujo.*

Why did it seem so real?

She looked up when the door in the waiting room opened, inordinately frightened of who it might be. She had to suppress a sigh of relief when it turned out to just be her therapist, back from watching the dream recording.

*Of course,* she thought. *Who else could it be?*

*Am I going crazy?*

Tanaka Yui wore a plain blouse, coupled with a medium‐length skirt. She sat down across from her, so that Asaka found herself looking directly back into the therapist\'s eyes.

She glanced away---something about those eyes disturbed her.

\"Well, I have to say: it was quite something,\" Yui said.

\"Yeah,\" Asaka responded, wondering if the therapist could tell how much viewing the dream log had unnerved her.

\"One of the things that struck the analysts about the dream was how strangely consistent it was, if that makes sense. Everything viewed in a dream is actively filled in by the brain, so it is usually the case that nothing really looks the same twice. Buildings change, people change, the situation changes---but that\'s not what this dream is like. It\'s startlingly consistent in narrative and detail, and the same people and objects recur throughout.\"

\"I see,\" Asaka said emptily, looking down at the floor. What was she supposed to say? It made sense.

\"There\'s also the mechanical voice that begins and ends the dream. I have to admit, in all our years of work, we\'ve seen nothing like it.\"

\"It\'s not from the recording system?\" Asaka asked, looking up in surprise. \"I thought...\"

\"No,\" Yui said, when she didn\'t finish the sentence. \"That voice was part of the dream itself, and we have legitimately no idea how it got there.\"

Asaka furrowed her brow. A mechanical voice...

What did it all mean? An unusually consistent dream, that felt disturbingly real, despite being impossibly fantastic---did it signal some kind of psychiatric problem?

\"In any case,\" Yui said, \"I have to ask you: Is there anything about your past you\'re keeping from me? Something that might explain the events in this dream?\"

The question froze Asaka for a moment. She looked for a moment at her open hand.

*What kind of question is that? My past? Is she wondering if I have some sort of trauma?*

\"Why?\" she asked, finally.

Yui took a breath, seeming conflicted.

\"Well, given the evidence on hand, we don\'t think it\'s really a psychological problem. The only conclusion that really makes sense to us is that what we\'re looking at here is some kind of legitimate memory, one...\"

Yui seemed to stall mid‐sentence, but for a moment Asaka didn\'t notice.

*A legitimate memory?* Asaka thought. *But that\'s...*

She didn\'t finish the thought, the word \"nonsense\" dying stillborn in her mind. Somehow she couldn\'t just dismiss it like that, and that was the most chilling revelation she had ever experienced.

Asaka looked up, eyes deeply confused, and Yui finally continued.

\"I don\'t know if I should really tell you this, but we think this dream is the fragment of a memory that was artificially suppressed at some point. The obvious conclusion is that you were involved in the alien war, but now you\'re here, somehow. It still doesn\'t entirely make sense, but it would explain the consistency of the dream, and the mechanical voice, which almost sounds like some kind of memory probe. I\'m not saying it\'s one hundred percent certain, but we do know that kind of technology exists, and this is... what it would probably look like.\"

The therapist looked small for a moment, almost as if she were afraid of Asaka somehow. Asaka wondered what her face looked like at that kind of moment.

She gaped silently. Suppressed memory? Memory probe? It sounded like some kind of conspiracy theorist fever‐dream, except her dream was hardly feverish at all. Instead, it was the kind of dream that was making the trained therapist in front of her visibly scared.

\"This kind of thing...\" Yui said, finally, now seeming confident that Asaka wasn\'t going to explode at her. \"I\'m worried we\'ve stumbled into some kind of secret Governance thing. Something dangerous. I\'m going to ask a friend I have, but... the whole thing makes me tremendously nervous. This is all textbook‐only stuff, training for dealing with Unification Wars veterans, but mostly hasn\'t been relevant for centuries. You\'re nowhere near that old. Officially, anyway, I guess. But then the dreams don\'t look anything like *that* war, and the technology was never really that good. The magical girl stuff must be some crossover from the video gaming, but maybe it\'s a hint---it\'s the only thing in the dream that doesn\'t feel real. But it fits in---\"

Yui\'s eyes, which had glazed over, snapped abruptly back into focus as the therapist realized she had slipped into a rant, talking to herself rather than to her patient.

\"Are you sure you don\'t remember anything about it?\" she asked.

Asaka wasn\'t sure why she felt suddenly so calm. By rights she should have been up and screaming, but instead something bothered her...

\"Alien war?\" she asked.

Yui blinked at her.

\"Yes. The war against the squid. You do remember, right?\"

Asaka put a hand to her head, shaking her head at her own question.

\"Yes, yes I do. Of course.\"

Yui looked at her with a combination of worry, fear, and scientific interest.

\"If you say so,\" she said. \"But if you do find yourself experiencing memory lapses, please tell us. It could be a hint. And...\"

Yui paused again, searching for the words.

\"I don\'t know,\" she said. \"This is too far out of my clinical experience. But... the patient is most important. If you feel uncertain or unhappy at all, I\'m here. I want you to come back in tomorrow for another study. And, if you can, show the video from this session to your wife. She figures prominently in the dream, so she might know something. In fact, bring her tomorrow, if you can.\"

Asaka looked at the therapist.

\"What the hell am I supposed to think?\" she said, finally. \"This is crazy. I should tell you you\'re crazy, but you\'re right: the dream feels real to me. But then what? Is my life fake somehow? What the hell am I supposed to do about that?\"

Asaka looked down.

\"Thank you for being honest with me,\" she said. \"I don\'t... The worst part is, I shouldn\'t believe any of this. My life is real. I should *know* that. But... somehow the dream feels like the truth, and that scares me. I regret ever coming in here. I\'m scared, and I don\'t want to know, but how can I live now without finding out?\"

Yui fiddled with her tablet.

\"I don\'t know.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Welcome home, Asaka.\"

Asaka could only hope she managed to respond to Alice cogently at the doorway, but suspected she had actually just mumbled something incoherent and stumbled past her. Alice wasn\'t the type to be offended by that, if there was something obviously wrong---and in this case, Asaka had no delusions about being able to convey that there was nothing wrong. Alice would know.

Instead, Asaka opted to lie down on their shared bed and stare out the window, waiting for her to come. She wasn\'t sure what to do---in the normal course of things, she\'d be glad to pour her heart out to Alice, but this? What was she supposed to say?

Besides that, there was the singularly unsettling fact that if the therapist had been right in her theories, then Alice had to be involved somehow. *Had to,* because not only was Alice part of the dream, the two of them had been practically hanging on each other\'s shoulders since high school---if there really were a mysterious gap in her recent life history, it couldn\'t possibly have gone beneath Alice\'s notice. That meant that if there was memory tampering going on, it had happened to Alice too or---unthinkable---Alice was in on it.

No, she couldn\'t doubt Alice. She wouldn\'t. But if it were the other possibility, she was doing Alice a disservice if she didn\'t say anything. Not just a disservice---she *had* to say something.

It was crazy that she was taking this seriously. It was more likely that this was all an overblown overreaction, that she had some sort of paranoia problem, and that the therapist didn\'t know what she was doing. At the very least, she should have sought a second opinion, or at least have talked to some of the dream \"analysts\".

And yet...

*Ugh, I have to talk to Alice.*

\"So I take it you didn\'t exactly get good news,\" Alice said, appearing next to her almost as if on cue.

Asaka looked up at her wife\'s face, wondering what to say. Ordinarily, at a difficult moment, she might have tried to pull Alice in for a tumble under the sheets. It was a coin flip whether or not Alice would accept, but even just the attempt would have relieved stress.

Somehow, at the moment, she just didn\'t feel like it.

She sighed, then frowned, noticing something.

\"When did that building show up?\" she asked, pointing out the window.

Alice glanced over, accepting for the moment the change to a seemingly irrelevant topic.

\"That? That\'s the Zeus Research Building. It\'s been in Mitakihara for at least a century, supposedly. Haven\'t you ever noticed it before?\"

\"No, yeah, that\'s...\" Asaka mumbled emptily, as thought to herself:

*Mitakihara? But that doesn\'t---why...*

She put a hand to her head.

\"I\'m sorry, Alice,\" she said, pushing herself into a seated position. "I need to de‐stress a little, play some games. I\'ll tell you about it afterwards. That\'s a guarantee.\"

She clasped hands with Alice and smiled slightly to seal the deal. Alice smiled back.

\"Okay, but I think I\'ll join you today.\"

Asaka nodded.

\"Alright.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was no prearranged, serious match this time. Much of the guild was engaged in practice matches, either with other parts of the guild or other guilds elsewhere.

Asaka and Alice materialized in the guild \"lounge\", a vast, simulated mansion filled to the brim with recreational delights, ranging from the virtual tennis courts, to the vast reading room, to the ever‐popular privacy rooms. More of a play area than a simulated reality, it was constantly shifting in response to the demands of its users, who generally teleported where they wished to be, rather than wasting time walking.

The server time required to run the simulation came directly out of guild funds, along with the rented VR equipment used by most members. It was a tremendously expensive perk, and testified to the success the guild had managed in attracting viewers---but the expense meant that recreation time was strictly limited, and tied to both combat performance and time spent in practice. As guild leader, Asaka had more access than anyone, but rarely used it, except for the occasional private session with Alice, when they felt like experimenting.

This time they weren\'t here for any of that, so they materialized straight into the waiting area, an unlimited‐access sitting room that was used for basic socialization, and of course to find games to join. As they walked through the room, a wave of greetings sounded from the other guild members in the room, which Asaka accepted pleasantly.

Alice\'s in‐game avatar, which was always what she was using in the lobby, bore a strong resemblance to the way Madhuri looked in real life---according to Madhuri, anyway; Asaka had never actually met her. Alice had chosen it primarily as an in‐joke, to reflect the way in which Madhuri\'s avatar reflected her.

Speaking of which...

\"Is something wrong?\" Alice asked, noting the frown that had appeared on Asaka\'s face.

\"Maybe,\" she said. \"I\'m trying to query if Madhuri is online, but this damn interface doesn\'t seem to be working. I thought we might have fun discussing the child you intend for us to have, and child licensing.\"

\"Who\'s Madhuri? And does this mean you\'re finally agreeing to it?\"

\"I\'m not agreeing. I\'m just saying that if---\"

Asaka froze mid‐sentence, turning to look Alice in the eye. A chill crept up her back.

\"Madhuri,\" she said. \"You know, second‐in‐command, old friend of mine. We talk all the time. You\'ve known her for years.\"

\"I don\'t know who you\'re talking about,\" Alice said, shaking her head. \"I don\'t know anyone named Madhuri. And second‐in‐command is Henrietta. Look, here she comes.\"

Asaka looked, and the girl approaching, with the absurdly pompous screenname \"Henrietta Nattherhiem Elenora\", had an avatar that looked more like Alice than Madhuri ever had.

\"Is something wrong?\" Henrietta asked, coming to a stop.

What Asaka felt then wasn\'t nausea, not exactly. It was more a combination of confusion, fear, and complete dislocation. She looked back and forth between Henrietta and the increasingly worried‐looking Alice, and her world spun, just a little.

\"Are you alright?\" Alice asked. \"I\'m really worried---\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asaka cut the simulation perfunctorily, using the almost never‐used emergency exit protocol. As the world came back into focus in front of her, she found herself breathing heavily.

As the connection cable detached, she leaned forward, putting her head in her hands. Next to her, Colonel Fluff raised its head, making an inquisitive noise.

\"*Are you okay?*\" her dog asked.

Asaka didn\'t know what to say. She couldn\'t deal with this right now. She *remembered* Madhuri. What was going on? Was she crazy?

She had gone into the game to try and relax, and it had only made things worse.

In that moment, with nothing solid to focus on, all she could think, almost nonsensically, was that if she were crazy, it was definitely not a good idea to have kids.

A long moment later, Alice stirred in the other chair, the twin to Asaka\'s own. At that moment, Asaka found herself pitifully unsure whether she wanted Alice to comfort her, or whether she preferred to be alone. She would never previously have thought she would ever want to be away from Alice, and that fact terrified her.

Alice walked over, and something abruptly occurred to Asaka, something that had strangely escaped her until then.

\"Where\'s Patricia?\" she asked, before Alice even had a chance to say anything.

Alice peered at her for a moment, weighing whether to answer the question or ask what was going on with Asaka.

\"Patricia? She was visiting earlier today, but she\'s gone demon hunting. Left before you got back. Asaka, what\'s wrong? Are you okay?\"

\"Demon hunting,\" Asaka said, repeating the words emptily.

Yes, that made sense, of course. They were magical girls, and that was what they did. There was no reason to expect Patricia to be here---she had her own flat, after all.

And yet, somehow, despite the sudden certainty, Asaka had the queasy sense that somehow, just a moment ago, the facts had been different. The world had been different. Reality had been different.

Instead of answering Alice\'s question, she grabbed the girl\'s waist, burying her face in her stomach. Colonel Fluff appeared at her side, whining, not using the texting service, which she was ignoring. Her dog knew something was wrong. It was almost an absurdist tableau.

\"I just---\" Asaka began, without moving her head.

She paused.

\"I want you to come with me to the therapist tomorrow,\" she said. "I---\"

She stopped, thinking about it.

\"Asaka, I\'m seriously worried about you right now,\" Alice said. "What happened to you at the dream study?\"

Asaka took a breath, and pushed herself up out of the chair, trying to stabilize herself.

No. The problem wasn\'t with reality. It was with herself. A defective implant or something. Or maybe the dream study had damaged something. It had to be something like that. She couldn\'t let herself fall apart. She would run an implant diagnostic, see if she still had dreams, then talk to Tanaka Yui tomorrow.

It had to work.

\"Something pretty crazy,\" she said. \"I think I need to run an implant self‐diagnostic. Something is wrong, I think.\"

\"A diagnostic?\" Alice repeated. \"No one has needed to do *that* for centuries.\"

\"I think I might be an exception.\"

\"Will you just tell me what\'s going on?\"

Alice glared at her, and Asaka met her gaze, the two of them engaging in a miniature battle of wills.

\"I\'ll tell you after the diagnostic,\" Asaka said. \"I know I promised, but please. I really think something is wrong. It\'s too hard to explain, and I should probably do it sooner rather than later.\"

Alice scowled at her.

\"Fine. Let\'s see what happens.\"

Asaka nodded, ignoring the hint of anger from Alice, and sat back down.

Reaching inward, she repeated a procedure they had all been taught in primary school, but had never expected to have to use.

〈*Are you sure?*〉 a mechanical voice asked, deep inside her.

*Yes.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike what she had heard was available to military personnel, civilian diagnostics were very limited. Specifically, they had access to a generic \"self‐diagnostic\", and that was it. More were available in Emergency Mode, but those weren\'t really relevant to her.

Nowadays, the self‐diagnostic routine placed the user into a brief period of induced sleep, which people found preferable to the old style, which involved a period of uncomfortable sensory restriction.

It had not occurred to Asaka to wonder if she would dream during diagnostic‐induced sleep. If she had, she would likely have guessed that she wouldn\'t---a situation where it was necessary to fiddle with brain implants seemed like exactly the kind of situation where even partial consciousness might be artificially suppressed.

And yet, she dreamed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*It\'s been a long time.*

*Asaka started, almost tripping over herself as she got up from the chair where she had been tapping her foot impatiently---then almost tripping over the bed next to her.*

*Privately, she cursed herself for choosing such a small bedroom for this simulation.*

\"*Yes, it has,*\" *she managed, once she had recovered her composure.*

*She and Alice stood awkwardly for a moment. It really* had *been a long time---the battlefield had kept the two of separated for far longer than Asaka cared to think about.*

*Even now, they still hadn\'t truly managed to meet, of course. This was a simulation, with VR access gifted from those of their friends who knew just how much they missed each other. Even with the relatively commonly VR‐tech prevalent in the military, it had taken them literally months to find a time‐frame in which they were both free and had access to VR chairs, which had the high fidelity they needed for this kind of meeting.*

*Unable to think of anything good to say, Asaka instead stepped forward, drawing the other girl into a hug, and then a kiss, long and sensuous.*

*When they finally ended it, Alice looked her in the eye. Much had been said, even if no words had been involved.*

\"*So,*\" *Alice said, smiling playfully.* \"*Should we talk first, or...*\"

*She looked meaningfully at the bed behind Asaka.*

\"*That is, after all, what people typically use these simulations for. Why else the VR chairs?*\" *Alice said*.

*Then her girlfriend gave her a look that made her blood run hot. She became abruptly aware of their bodies pressed against each other, of certain body parts that suddenly had her attention.*

\"*I suppose we can play first and talk later,*\" *Asaka said, more hesitantly than she really felt.* \"*If that\'s what you want.*\"

\"*It\'s what I want.*\"

*The two of them stumbled backward onto the bed, hands groping awkwardly.*

\"*You know,*\" *Alice said, breathing into her neck.* \"*We don\'t have to do this. We could just delete the clothes from the simulation entirely. Would be faster.*\"

\"*I want foreplay, Alice,*\" *Asaka managed, despite a distracting digging motion the other girl was making with her hand.*

\"*I suppose you don\'t want to try using different bodies, either,*\" Alice said, sounding playfully disappointed.* \"*That\'s a popular thing to do.*\"

*Asaka answered the question by grabbing a particular sensitive region on Alice\'s body.*

\"*I want you, Alice,*\" *she said, feeling her voice drop several registers.*

\"*I know.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Afterward, they talked, Asaka\'s head resting on Alice\'s neck.*

\"*I\'m sorry I can\'t visit you more,*\" *Asaka said.* \"*I think we can do this more often.*\"

\"*I know,*\" *Alice said.* \"*But it\'s not your fault. Not my fault either. It\'s the way things are. We just have to live with it.*\"

\"*It\'s different for me, though. I\'m an officer. I could make time, if I really wanted to.*\"

\"*No. You have obligations. I understand.*\"

\"*It kills me.*\"

\"*I know,*\" *Alice said. She always knew.*

*They lay in silence for a moment.*

\"*Sometimes I wish I didn\'t,*\" *Asaka said.* \"*Have obligations, that is. If I hadn\'t been promoted---*\"

\"*Don\'t start this again,*\" *Alice warned.* \"*We\'ve been over this. The MHD would never have let us stay close together anyway.*\"

\"*I wished to be good with human society,*\" *Asaka said.* \"*And so I am---that\'s what the promotions are about, I think. But that\'s not really what I want. Not anymore. What kind of world is this, where a girl has to regret her wish?*\"

\"*It\'s the world we live in,*\" *Alice said,* \"*and we have to deal with it. You would never have met me without that wish. Think of it that way.*\"

\"*I wish we didn\'t---*\" *Asaka began.*

*Then she stopped, as an internal voice warned the both of them that a surprise alien offensive had just begun, and all personnel needed to head immediately to combat positions.*

\"*Seriously?*\" *she complained angrily.*

\"*I\'ll see you next week,*\" *Alice said.* \"*That\'s a promise.*\"

\"*Yeah.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Colonel Emmanuel James has been killed in combat, *the Command Gestalt thought,* 60% of subordinate officers have now been lost, along with of the command AI bunkers.

*Somewhere in the depths of her mind, Asaka swore. The command structure below her was running on fumes already, as could be inferred from the simple fact that she, a colonel, was running* an entire three‐division corps, *a role fit for a lieutenant general. That implied, at a minimum, that all the brigadier generals and major generals were either dead or unable to reach a usable command post. In all likelihood, the only reason General Filopovic was still alive was the fact that he was commanding from orbit. Squid decapitation strikes were* brutal, *a fact that helped the growing presence of magical girls in the officer corps.*

*The obvious answer was field promotion. The design of the command structure was intended to facilitate the smooth replacement of lost officers as much as possible---but loss of efficacy was still unavoidable. Inexperienced lieutenants and captains were filling in for captains and majors throughout the line, and their inexperience was getting themselves---and the tattered remains of their units---killed.*

*She hoped her own position wasn\'t evident of that.*

*As a colonel, she was already used to operating on the outer edges of Maximal Command Mode, connected to the AI networks through a fortified command bunker. That experience was serving her well now, even if she had to operate from a far more central role.*

*The command post she was in still had active communications and orbital links, so she knew all she needed to about the situation---and the situation was dire. The squid attack had thrown the entire front into disarray, and she was caught in the thick of it, holding the one position that* had *to hold, against at least three times her number. She would have expected that to mean she would receive reinforcements, but the squid had launched a major orbital attack as well. The mobile reserve was pinned down by orbital fire, and she wouldn\'t receive any orbital support of her own for a long time.*

*They were alone, the line was breaking, and she had no reserves of her own left.*

We need time to disengage! We\'ll get torn up if we just turn and leave! one of the brand‐new colonels beneath her thought, referring to the brigade under his command, which Asaka had ordered to move and reinforce one of the faltering sectors.*

I know, *Asaka thought, growling slightly.* You don\'t have to tell me. The orders are to move when practicable. Make it practicable.

Newbies, *she thought to herself.*

*They were unused to Command Mode, and insisted on communicating directly far too often, instead of just using their damn interfaces, making both their jobs much harder than it needed to be. Verbal communications raised morale at the lower levels, but at the command level it just crowded out much more efficient \"machine\" communication.*

*But the concern the colonel had brought up was legitimate, she thought, the train of logic racing through her synapses, into the AI subroutines, and back out again, over and over, impossibly fast. She was trying to shorten the line to prevent a breakthrough at the Point 54‒57 line, but these kinds of maneuvers took time, especially when under fire. To precipitate a withdrawal by any unit in one of the other sectors could imperil the entire area, but the need was critical---4th regiment was already in literal pieces, each part withdrawing to a different location, leaving a hole open that led straight to the rear. Someone had to stay and buy as much time as they could.*

*The only viable choice was the piece in the middle: remnants of 2nd battalion, comprising delta company, part of charlie company, beta company, with fragments of 1st battalion, delta company. Their magical girl contingent was depleted, with only seven active. Withdrawing them would compromise the position, and given how critical the position was to the corps, and how critical the corps was to the front as a whole, it was necessary to sacrifice---*

*The realization hit her then, strong enough to even interrupt the AI‐mediated command state, piercing the cloud of emotional detachment that naturally accompanied.*

*Second division, second battalion, delta company was the company Alice was in. She knew that by heart---of course she did.*

*With command responsibilities still screaming at her, she ran through her options as fast she could. Reinforce---no reinforcements available. Withdraw---she might literally lose the colony. Withdraw only Alice---a complete non‐starter. Alice would know what was going on. She wouldn\'t go. Agonizingly, Asaka knew she wouldn\'t.*

I can\'t---I don\'t---

*The decision tore at her mind. It was her worst nightmare, made real. She should have never been in command of her own lover, it had only happened because of the breakdown in command---but what was she supposed to do? How could she order her to do this? Alice was going to die. It was nearly certain. But then, how could she? How could---*

*And then she felt the soft muffling grip of her TacComp\'s emotional suppression descending on her with maximum force, certain parts of her brain simply silenced into oblivion. The command AI had issued the order, had already issued the order to stand at all costs; she had other duties to attend to.*

Then the dream broke, and the pain hit her, all at once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asaka woke gasping, with tears in her eyes, and this time was different than all the rest.

*She remembered.*

Half an hour later, Alice had died, and the combat AI had kept that fact from her.

What she had told herself at the time wasn\'t the truth. If it had been, perhaps she could have handled it.

The truth was that the TacComp\'s emotional suppression couldn\'t keep a magical girl\'s emotions quashed, not when the soul gem was involved, as it should have been. The command AIs had no authority to control a personal TacComp---the emotional suppression had to have originated from Asaka herself, or from the TacComp, with at least her tacit approval.

She had looked it up, after the fact, confirming for herself what she already knew.

How, then?

She had always known the truth.

In the moment, she had simply run from the experience, \"allowed\" the emotional suppression to close itself over her and protect her from the decision---protect her from having to think about what she had done, even if only for the rest of the battle.

As for why her soul gem hadn\'t resisted, who knew? Maybe it had simply followed her wishes. Maybe, in the end, she hadn\'t loved Alice enough.

That was the thought that had broken her, in the end. She couldn\'t come to terms with the guilt. Should she have been angrier? More despairing? She felt ashamed that she hadn\'t broken down on the spot. She felt she should* have.

She had heaped her devotion onto Alice, had *willed* herself into it, because it made her feel human. She *wanted* to love someone, but in the moment---

She clenched her eyes together, sobbing, feeling the anguish returning.

Then she felt a soft hand grab hers, and she opened her eyes.

Alice stood there, framed in the sunlight pouring through the window, and Asaka blinked, wondering if this was still the simulation.

The girl shook her head, answering her thought.

\"I\'m dead, Asaka,\" she said. \"Part of you always knew that, no matter how deep you tried to bury it, no matter how hard you tried to shape this world around you. You even tried to Reformat yourself, crudely, but you knew it couldn\'t last forever.\"

\"I don\'t want you to be gone!\" Asaka pleaded grasping at the arms of a girl she knew only to be a simulation. \"I couldn\'t live, but they wouldn\'t let me *die.* It was agony! Even if it had to end, I wanted out!\"

The girl shook her head again.

\"I\'m not entirely gone,\" she said. \"I never will be. It\'s very cliché to say, but I will always be in your memories. This simulation is proof. I\'m not a puppet fabricated by the machine. I\'m constructed from your own memories, your dreams and longings. It\'s the only way the simulation could possibly fool you.\"

Asaka clenched her teeth, looking down at the false carpet.

\"Then I\'m sitting here talking to my own imagination,\" she said.

\"Perhaps,\" her memory of Alice said. \"But your imagination also knows what Alice would think of you.\"

The apparition grabbed her by the chin, forcing her to look up.

\"She wanted you to be free,\" the girl said. \"Free from the nightmares that haunt you. You\'ve always thought yourself inadequate to live in this world. Even after your wish, even after the promotions, you never believed in yourself. She wanted you to be strong enough to live your own life. Yet here you are, still running. Do you think this is what she would have wanted?\"

\"Of course not!\" Asaka spat, looking away. \"But I can\'t be what she wanted. I\'m here, aren\'t I? If I *were* what she wanted, I wouldn\'t have constructed a memory‐erasing simulation to hide from reality. I certainly wouldn\'t have added magic to the mix.\"

\"She believed in you,\" her memory said reprovingly. \"Someday you will believe in yourself.\"

\"I can\'t believe that.\"

Alice shook her head.

\"Well, someday. This simulation is over.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asaka woke a second time, and this time the weariness in her body, and the weight of her memory, told her that there was nothing else to wake up from.

She raised her right arm, peering blearily at her wrist, where a cable attached to one of her auxiliary access ports, for more bandwidth.

Then her TacComp poured into her consciousness an emotionless computerized tirade, rebuking her for violating regulation and protocol, acting against its recommendations, performing unauthorized psychologically‐dangerous activities, risking gem failure, blocking its access to her consciousness, and so forth.

She didn\'t blame it for being angry, but the whole thing gave her a headache, and she told the device to shove it.

What on Earth was she supposed to do now? She hadn\'t exactly planned what to do once the simulation was over, and it had been intended to run much longer than *that*. Years of simulation time, at least---she\'d spent all she had on this. She wondered just who was responsible---

\"You gave us a lot of trouble, you know,\" a voice near her said.

Almost resignedly, she turned her head to peer at the stranger.

No, not a stranger.

Tanaka Yui, telepath and MSY founder, smiled at her, a conspicuous black connection cable running to her spinal port.

\"Oh, screw you,\" Asaka said, turning away, looking at her soul gem, which was set on a table, buried in what was literally a mound of grief cubes.

It was practically blasphemous to talk to a founder that way, but she didn\'t care at the moment. Her dream was over, and in its place she had nothing*.

\"The department didn\'t think you were capable of manipulating your own mental state with magic,\" Yui said. \"Evidently, we were wrong. You went to a lot of trouble to lock yourself in. It\'s very rare that I have to attempt an Unformat while concurrently manipulating the simulation. Very interesting. Of course, we unfortunately had to arrest your accomplices in this matter, the ones you paid to take care of you. Do you have any idea how dangerous that pile of grief cubes is to civilians?\"

\"Why are you here?\" Asaka asked angrily. \"The MHD has plenty of specialists they can send. And aren\'t you afraid I\'m going to go crazy and attack you?\"

Yui laughed quietly.

\"You wouldn\'t. I\'ve had plenty of time to get to know you, and the simulation was modified to eject you so that you wouldn\'t be violent or suicidal when you emerged.\"

The magical girl appeared next to Asaka, looming over her.

\"I want you to know,\" she said, face somber. \"That last part, with Alice and your memories---that was authentic. I don\'t want you to think I was controlling it. She wouldn\'t give up on you, and we won\'t either.\"

\"You don\'t know her,\" Asaka growled. \"You don\'t know any---\"

\"Asaka!\"

The new voice, sharp and piercing, was unfamiliar to her, and Asaka sought its source.

An Indian woman, tall and lithe with red crying eyes, appeared above her, wrapping her into an overly‐tight hug.

Asaka was quite certain she had never seen her before, but she seemed strangely familiar.

\"It\'s me!\" the woman said, before Asaka could try to query her nomenclator. \"Madhuri. I know we\'ve never met each other, but when I heard you\'d disappeared---do you know how hard we were looking for you? How much you made us worry?\"

\"She helped us find you,\" Yui said, smiling again. \"It appears she knows the gaming underworld just as well as you do.\"

\"I\'m sorry, Madhuri,\" Asaka said, her own eyes tearing up as the woman cried softly on her shoulder, because she didn\'t know what else to say.

It was true: she was sorry, a little, for making her worry, but she had valued her own happiness more.

\"Bringing her friends is cheap and manipulative,\" another voice said. "Risky, too. She probably doesn\'t want anyone to see her like this. I\'d be embarrassed.\"

\"Cheap, but effective,\" Yui replied. \"With the two of you here, she\'s forced to try and act happy.\"

Asaka didn\'t need an introduction this time.

\"You brought *Patricia?*\" she said. \"You\'re right. She\'s the last person I\'d want---\"

\"Hello to you too,\" Patricia interrupted, appearing next to her and tugging at Madhuri until the woman released her hug.

For a moment, Asaka stared at the three of them as they watched her.

Patricia sighed, blonde ponytail swaying as she shook her head slightly.

\"What are we going to do with you?\" she asked rhetorically, bending over to detach Asaka\'s connections to the machines---one to each wrist, one to the back of the neck, one to the lower spine, a nutrient feed.

\"You\'re clearly not fit to be left alone,\" Patricia said. \"I\'m going to take you home with me, we\'ll talk with your parents, and we\'ll wait until you get better. We\'ve already agreed. Madhuri will take care of your gaming career for a while.\"

Madhuri nodded solemnly, still a bit teary‐eyed, and Asaka felt bewildered, smothered by hospitality. She needed to be *angry, spiteful* even, but she was being denied the opportunity. She couldn\'t explode with her friends there.

\"You\'ll get better,\" Tanaka Yui said, nodding seriously. \"My reputation depends on it, since I\'ve taken on your case.\"

\"I already dislike you,\" Asaka said poisonously, feeling she had to say *something*.

Yui laughed, shrilly.

\"None of my patients *like* me,\" she said.

\"Here,\" Patricia said, when they had settled onto a military transport back to Earth.

Asaka, who had been sitting in a corner staring at her hands, looked up.

She peered skeptically at the small box Patricia was holding.

\"I never got a chance to give it to you,\" Patricia says. \"It\'s a wedding ring. Alice was thinking about proposing, before we left training. She decided not to. She said she didn\'t want to tie you down. Not yet. She was going to wait until after the first combat rotation.\"

Asaka took the box, and opened it, looking at the small metal ring enclosed within. Silver, with symbols inscribed on it---she always had a sense of humor.

\"I don\'t know what to think,\" she said. \"Why do you even have this?\"

\"She said it was in case something happened to her. I told her she was being too pessimistic, but I... well. Anyway, it should be yours.\"

Asaka stared at the ring, thinking back to all that had happened since she had first gotten her soul gem ring. Being shipped off to training without a single friend in the world, the roommate who intimidated her, just a little. Their first combat simulations, her roommate pulling her away from the group to sneak in a kiss. Alice, she thought, had been just as lonely as she was. Perhaps, if things had been different...

Unbidden, the tears began to stream from her eyes. Why did it have to turn out this way?
