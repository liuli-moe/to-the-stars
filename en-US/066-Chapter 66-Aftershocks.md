# Chapter 66: Aftershocks

> On the back of this provisional communications infrastructure grew the sprouts of a unique internal culture, and what would one day be a true sociological wonder: a sealed internal cultural and media ecosystem, encompassing enough to replace the mundane world entirely for many members.
>
> But the beginnings were humble. The network was at first used only for Charter compliance reporting: securely documented grief cube contributions to the Pool and financial contributions to the Fund, team wellness reports, and other official matters. It was several years before extensive use developed in the opposite direction—in the form of General Meeting announcements, recordings, and minutes—and several more years before the introduction of horizontal channels.
>
> Mundane commercial products had always provided the means of day‐to‐day communication within the MSY, despite longstanding Incubator complaints, but increasing automoderation and security issues made the need for a replacement quite obvious. Initial initiatives provided the basics of a more secure magical framework: peer‐to‐peer messaging, chatrooms, and an MSY‐wide forum, with the latter's history imported from its commercial predecessor.
>
> Soon after, enterprising organization members began initiatives of their own. This included several social media copycats, to varying degrees of success, along with attempts at everything from newsletters to dating services.
>
> The MSY was initially content to allow the system to grow as it would, providing funding and support for security and infrastructure, but little else. That changed within decades, as the first media personalities emerged and proved themselves supremely adept at manipulating public opinion and belief, most notably Chiyo Rika, whose biweekly opinion videos became essential viewing for politicos.
>
> The final impetus for regulation came with the MSY's suppression of the Japanese Yakuza syndicates. While nominally a planned, deliberate action with the legitimate support of the Leadership Committee, the tidal wave of public opinion that surged out of a few key incidents gave them almost no choice, nearly triggering a crisis. In particular, the Nagoya Crimes—in which the family of a popular team lead was murdered, followed by her bloody reprisals and the MSY's attempts to contain the fallout—led to waves of outrage about both real and false abuses by both the MSY and Yakuza.
>
> Afterward, amidst concerns about misinformation and panic, the MSY made its first attempts to perform stewardship on its own media.
>
> They found the task challenging. Not only were most of the existing commentators and online communities steadfastly resistant to outside manipulation or monitoring, but the system as a whole was heavily decentralized, with federated groups maintaining locally‐encrypted comms, resistant to even magical penetration, based on techniques and technologies the leadership itself had produced and rolled out.
>
> Instead, the leadership was forced to proceed much more cooperatively, bringing prominent opinion‐makers into the fold with promises of access and both technical and financial support. With the Charter Rewrite of 2059 and the investiture of legislative power in the newly‐formed Rules Committee, many of these favored media leaders soon won political office as well, further increasing their media clout. Chiyo Rika, in particular, quickly rose to become Speaker of the Rules Committee.
>
> This rather incestuous relationship between MSY officialdom and media would become a staple of the pre‐Unification Wars era. Legally speaking, the MSY's culture and media organizations were largely free from direct interference, but in practice everything from the social media nonprofits to the movie studios were run by MSY leadership—not by conspiracy, not exactly, but rather through a natural consolidation of power and a shared cultural consensus.
>
> There things would mostly stay, until the advent of the Unification Wars.
>
> With the benefit of hindsight, conventional wisdom pegs the MSY media as an unwitting accomplice of the radicals of the Mages First movement, and of the budding Freedom Alliance more generally. Media elites, beholden to the political status quo, projected their own complacency to the public, downplaying the tensions growing within the MSY, and suppressing extremist rhetoric from the alleged fringes. Further, alarmed by the waves of AI‐powered public manipulation emanating from the mundane world, they attempted to isolate the MSY public—and themselves—in a protected bubble. To a degree, this worked—but not everyone was listening.
>
> The radical political violence of the St. Petersburg Atrocity, and the legitimate popular support it garnered among a minority of ordinary magical girls, thus came as a brutal shock to the MSY and to its media organs. The MSY could not unite in pursuit of peace, as its leaders had hoped—the ferocity with which the majority's stifled interventionist sentiment erupted proved that. Decades of cultural management collapsed overnight as raw public emotion overrode everything. In an irregular full membership meeting, multiple Charter amendments were passed via direct referendum, plunging the MSY—and the world—into war.
>
> The wartime pattern that ensued would be familiar to most students of history. Media policy shifted to an unapologetic pro‐war stance, with the rapidly centralizing and expanding MSY bureaucracy exerting substantially expanded control over the media. Freedoms of press and speech were significantly curtailed in the name of victory and the elimination of Freedom Alliance influence, though notably to a lesser extent than in mundane society.
>
> But the eventual end of the wars brought a real surprise: chafing at wartime restrictions and angry at the failures of the prewar political apparatus, the postwar Rules Committee drove a paradigm‐shifting wave of media liberalization, independence, and decentralization. Perhaps the most consequential change was an outright ban on media employment and ownership for all government officials, both elected and appointed, which has held all the way to the present day. Coming as it did at the end of a long period of media subservience to political power, most established media players chose their offices over their megaphones, opening up the media landscape to a brand‐new generation of personalities and institutions.
>
> Of course, there is one story that must always accompany any account of the "Revolution in Media". Throughout this period Chiyo Rika, Speaker of the Rules Committee once again, consistently championed every piece of media reform legislation, leveraging her own media empire into an effort that eroded her own power. By the time the dual‐role ban came up for debate, she controlled just one company, holding nothing but the rights to the past two centuries of her biweekly opinion videos. When that measure finally passed, she stood up upon the dais of the Rules Committee plenary chamber, and announced her immediate resignation—not from her company but from the speakership itself.

This can vary from the direct exchange of resources for changes in behavior, analogous to incentive payments, all the way to agreed mutual convergence of pref‐specs. For instance, a Tentacle that prizes the preservation of native species may provide resources to another Tentacle that prizes it far less, in exchange for a promise to protect their local ecologies. Alternatively, the second Tentacle may agree to modify their own pref‐specs to value such preservation more, in exchange for some other modification by the first Tentacle.

High‐level regulation of the pref‐arb market is conducted by organs of the Consensus itself, both to enforce binding‐preference‐alteration‐agreements (BiPAAs) and to prevent large‐scale negative side effects on Thinker society.

The conspiracy had burst open like a magic sack of shit, to use Kyouko's phrasing.

Imagine you were a shadowy group with backdoor access to Governance, a treasure trove of stolen secrets, and a history of unsavory action. Imagine that you realized one day that you had been discovered, your backdoors were closing, and all your assets were being burned—but, critically, not all at once. You still had some control.

What might you do?

You might throw everything you had at the wall, deploy everything you had all at once. You might overturn the entire dump truck of secrets, release everything embarrassing and incriminating you had on file about all your opponents, regardless of whether or not they were dead war heroes.

You might even commandeer some orbital defenses and try to kill a few people.

"SHELA will remain offline while extensive reverification proceeds," *Governance: Public Order* said, addressing the virtual media room. "Despite the dramatic fireworks, I'd like to emphasize again that I've been assured that no civilian lives were lost on the targeted space elevators, and that OrbCom is now fully secure. Looking at the full breadth of Earth's defenses, this was only a small blip in an otherwise contained security situation."

Mami sipped from a teacup as she watched, only paying a sliver of attention.

What Public Order had failed to mention was that, of course, very few civilians used the space elevators these days. The most severely damaged elevator, Chennai's, had had only two civilians in orbit, and they had both been severely injured. There had been quite a few military deaths.

Mami couldn't fault Public Order for stressing the limited nature of the incident, though. The truth was—and here was a secret that was still secret—it could have been *much* worse. That wasn't just extrapolation based on motive; post hoc analysis showed that the conspiracy had the hooks in place to do far more real damage. Sabotage of critical war production industries, for example. Detonation of exotic matter stores. Nanite attacks on food sources. Even crippling units in the field.

There had been *instances* of such attacks, but not on a wide scale. Just isolated incidents, here and there. Even a few examples of malicious orders being given and then suddenly retracted.

It was possible to guess at reasons why they would behave this way, but there was no way to be sure. Not yet; not until Governance's inquisitors returned with answers. Nor was it possible to be certain of the political ramifications, for both Governance and the MSY.

She set her teacup onto a plate with a clatter.

Somehow, in the midst of all this, she was most bothered by the behavior of her friends. Kyouko and Yuma, who had known far more than her about what was going on, and elected not to tell her. Homura, who had shown up to help save Earth orbit, then disappeared again, ignoring all her pleas.

Homura…

Her reappearance had shaken Mami, more than she had ever anticipated. She wanted nothing more than to hide in her room and brood on it, but even if she might have gotten away with that in better times, there was no way she could now. Every neuron, every atom of her soul gem, needed to be fully tasked.

Even now, most of her was still elsewhere, tending to the myriad crises. These few minutes with her tea had been stolen out of her schedule, a mere gesture.

*Mami…* Machina thought, the shimmer of her avatar at the edge of Mami's vision, the way she now preferred it.

*I know,* Mami thought. *The meeting is starting.*

*No, not that,* Machina thought, as Mami tensed for this sliver of her mind to be drawn away. *I can open up time for reflection in your schedule. It will help you, I'm sure.*

Machina would have no doubt suggested she see one of her two therapists, too, if the first weren't currently reduced to a soul gem and the second dead.

*Maybe,* Mami conceded.

And then she was in VR, with Kyouko and Yuma, who were aboard Kana's *Megane,* still inbound back towards Earth, where they would face what music awaited them. For convenience, the setting was the *Megane* itself, where Kyouko and Yuma would interact with her avatar—though the VR would ensure she would be more than just a hologram.

It was strange seeing Yuma in a teenage form again—it had been some time. Mami found herself studying her face, and Kyouko's, looking for any sign of what they had undergone, any bit of useful emotion.

They looked worried, and not just for themselves.

Or so she imagined.

"Are you both okay?" she asked, after too long. She had the sense they had been afraid to speak first, not knowing her mood.

This would have been a lot easier if they were in the same room.

"We're just fine, Mami," Kyouko said, raising a hand. "Good as can be, for two idiots knee‐deep in shit. Look, I know what you're thinking, and we look really stupid, but nothing was supposed to turn out that way. It turned out to be way more than we could chew."

"It's really my fault," Yuma added, shooting an annoyed look at Kyouko. "I've been too cautious, and I didn't trust anyone enough, you included. And I'm sure you've seen our report; I'd be dead right now if she hadn't barged in. My judgment was poor."

This was a lot more contrite than Mami had expected them to be, particularly Yuma.

Mami hadn't even been mad at them, not really—just disappointed. Not coming back alive was the only thing she would have found truly difficult to forgive.

Kyouko looked a little disturbed at Yuma's words, too.

"I'm glad you're okay," Mami said, simply. She had prepared something for this, a short little lecture coupled with her best disappointed Onee‐san face, but their reactions took her heart out of it.

"You okay?" Kyouko asked.

"Yes," Mami said. "No, honestly, I'm bothered you two left me out of this. Not because it's inherently my business or anything, but because I could have helped. Maybe you were trying to protect me or avoid distracting me but, take it from me, trying to keep everything to yourself doesn't end well."

Mami sighed. What was she looking for, an apology? That didn't make sense.

She had been busy. Too busy. Would it have been efficient for her to help even if she *had* known? Perhaps they could have prepared better for everything to explode—but they hadn't known that was going to happen. Were trying to prevent it, in fact.

"I was worried sick over you two, you know," Mami said. "You should have seen me at Carthago, I was a mess. Please don't do this to me again, okay? All these years, there's only been the four of us, and I don't like what Homura has done to us. Let's not risk it, okay?"

She had said more than she intended, and she felt a bit guilty at how chastened Yuma and Kyouko looked. But had she said anything wrong?

"You're right, you have a point," Yuma said. "It's just safer if more of us know about it, at least."

Mami nodded.

An awkward silence followed. It didn't help that all three of them were prioritizing other matters; this really was not the way to have this conversation, but they could hardly wait a week to have it.

Mami decided to press on.

"Speaking of things we should know about, I should tell you that I felt Homura near Carthago. She was helping us defend against the attack."

She paused just long enough for them to digest what she said, then continued:

"I left that out of the main report, of course, because of how sensitive it is, but yes, I'm sure. I know what it feels like to be amplified by Homura. I wanted to chase her down, but I was busy, so all I could do was beg her to stay. She didn't. I had Machina prepare a log you can browse, if you like."

"If you've been reading everything we reported, then you'll know that we've been seeing the shadow of Homura *everywhere*," Kyouko said. "She started making moves the same time everyone else did. And now that we've had time to study the security logs and interview people, there were quite a few unknown magical girls near the Church just before the Prometheus collapse. So it makes sense that Homura would be there too, sort of."

It took Yuma a bit longer to respond, probably because she was actually bulldozing through Mami's log. Mami felt like she could even see the gears spinning in her head.

This form really suited Yuma better, Mami thought. This way, she didn't have to experience cognitive dissonance whenever Yuma's expression turned decidedly non‐child‐like.

"The thing is," Yuma said, "if the TCF breach was her reason for hiding away before, that certainly can't be her reason now. Maybe she has another rationalization, maybe not. But I'm not sure it's possible for us to read into her motives from here."

"Then there's little we can do," Kyouko said, leaning forward. "Not like we've had success finding her before. And now that we know she has a plan, maybe we should just let her execute. I doubt we have a choice anyway."

There was a time when Mami wouldn't have caught the full meaning of what Kyouko was saying, but for better or for worse, that time had passed.

"You think she's working for your Goddess still, right?" she asked, looking Kyouko in the eye. "Before, you thought she was lost, but not anymore."

Kyouko blinked, then wrinkled her face in confusion.

"Well, yeah," she said. "It's the reasonable conclusion, right? And you should be with me on this. You've talked to the Goddess."

"Hold on," Yuma said, holding up a hand. "I don't like how quickly this turned into a religious conversation. Mami‐nee‐san, I know you visited her Church. I didn't want to pry about something like that, but…"

Her voice trailed off as she saw the look on Mami's face. Mami had been dreading this conversation.

"There's more to Kyouko's religion than it seems," Mami said, smiling uneasily. "The Ribbon is a powerful magical artifact."

She refused to meet Yuma's gaze, instead continuing the conversation with Kyouko.

"I asked her about Homura, the last time I talked to her. She didn't give me a straight answer. She also said she had a 'positive feeling' about the pulsar mission, which was not exactly honest. Nor did she mention any of the disasters we've run into. She either doesn't know as much as she lets on, or I've been rather used."

Kyouko made an unhappy face.

"You have to understand," she began.

"Okay, no," Yuma interrupted. "Don't just leave me out of this. Are you sure you're okay, Mami? This isn't like you. Was something done to you?"

Mami finally looked at Yuma, whose expression was deeply distressed, perhaps even angry.

Firstly, there was no way Mami could successfully distract the likes of Yuma. Secondly, she deserved to know.

After all, Homura had kept the secret from them for centuries, and look how that had turned out.

*No, that wasn't what happened,* she thought to herself, with a shiver of guilt. *She didn't push it, but none of us tried hard enough to listen to her. We treated it all as delusion.*

"No, it's not like me," Mami said, making her expression as serious as possible. "Not even Sakura‐san has heard this."

She paused, taking in Kyouko's mildly surprised reaction.

"After I undid my self‐Reformat, I remembered a few things," Mami said. "I remembered being there with Akari at the very end, what it was like. We shared a very close bond. When her soul gem ran out, she started to *change*, into something terrible. I saw… I saw a glimpse, of pure despair, before the Law of Cycles took it away. I didn't know what to make of it."

She kept going, not giving the others the chance to interrupt, or herself the chance to have second thoughts.

"I thought that that was how we would all go, tortured into something inhuman, and that was part of what ruined me. Afterward, I talked with Homura, and she told me that her Goddess saved Akari, prevented her final transformation—but I couldn't believe her."

"When I remembered that, I went to her Ribbon to find out the truth, and there I met the Goddess in a vision. And Mikuni Oriko."

She paused finally, looking Yuma in the eye. She knew that if nothing else, Oriko would get Yuma's attention—that, in retrospect, might have been a part of why Oriko had been there in the first place.

Yuma's expression was hard, if shocked. Mami could tell she didn't really buy it; at least not the parts she needed to.

"Mami, I know you're convinced you saw something, but no one has ever denied that Kyouko's Ribbon has *some* kind of effect on people. Are you *sure* you're not being manipulated?"

"Oh, give me a break," Kyouko said. "Mami is one of our biggest experts in mental protection and enchanted objects. You think *she* wouldn't have noticed?"

"*You've been hiding something like* that?" Kyouko sent to Mami via a side channel. "*The Church's knowledge of exactly what She saved us from is very limited. Homura always claimed it wasn't for us to know. Are you sure you're okay, having those memories back?*"

Kyouko had been silent, astonished even, but had pulled it together, enough to defend Mami, though without her usual energy.

Mami nodded.

"I didn't notice a thing," she said. She *had* met Kyubey at the Ribbon, but at worst, that spoke to a different kind of manipulation.

"*I'm fine,*" Mami sent back to Kyouko. "*Well, at least I think so. I suppose I didn't exactly gain a complete understanding. I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. I didn't want you or your theologians after me.*"

She saw Kyouko make a brief, angry expression, followed by a despairing hand gesture. Fortunately, Yuma wasn't looking in her direction.

"*More. Later.*"

"Well, given the success it has evidently had, you wouldn't remember noticing anything, would you?" Yuma said, brittly.

"It doesn't matter whether you believe me or not," Mami said, shaking her head. "I know what I saw. I'm telling you as a courtesy, to a friend."

This was not going well. Mami could see Yuma's gaze darting back and forth, and Kyouko gearing up for more angry imprecations. It was obvious these would be arguments that wouldn't go anywhere, at least not right now.

There was nothing else to do about it, she thought.

"I need to talk to her again," Mami said, looking at Kyouko. "You can arrange that for me?"

"*I'll… answer questions once I get there.* Afterward."

Kyouko rolled her eyes, causing Yuma to give her an odd look.

"Fine," Kyouko said, with a slight edge in her voice, meeting her gaze. "I want you to know: no one else gets the privilege you do, to just pretend like it didn't happen, but it seems you've been holding back quite a lot."

Mami sighed.

"Yes, but keep my name out of it," she said. "I'm not going to be used for your recruiting. I'm not convinced of the benevolence or power of your Goddess. As far as I'm concerned, she's a magical entity who is useful to talk to."

Kyouko rolled her eyes again.

"You know we could actually use the endorsement right about now. After all, we're going to be on shaky ground with all these leaks. You come off smelling like roses."

"I'd really rather not right now," Mami said.

Kyouko made a face.

Mami sighed. She didn't like where this was going at all.

"Look, you know I have good reasons," she said, raising a hand. "Let's not let something like this come between us. We need to act together, now more than ever."

Kyouko closed her eyes. Mami felt tempted to grab her hand, and Yuma's, too, but surely that was too much.

There was a brief silence, before Kyouko spoke.

"Yeah, I know," Kyouko said. "Sorry, it's just been a long week. Very long week."

Mami nodded in gratitude, then paused. She could feel Machina's subtle encouragement.

Before she could second‐guess herself again, she took her friends' hands, just for a moment, and gave a gentle squeeze.

It was still VR, but it would do.

"So would you like to come with me, then, Yuma‐chan?" she asked. "It might help alleviate your concerns."

"I had thought to suggest it myself," Yuma said, in a voice caught between surprise and her intended no‐nonsense seriousness. "But I'm going to bring monitoring equipment, and I'm not promising I'll go close to the thing myself. I could keep this a secret from Governance, but I'd understand if—"

"That's fine," Kyouko said, looking much more at ease than she had just moments prior. "We've done that ourselves already. It'll ruffle a few feathers, but I can take care of that."

"Then it's settled," Mami said.

She waited a few seconds for anyone to object, but no one did.

If only she could end the meeting on such a high note.

"So, this will seem like a bit of a tangent," Mami said. "But I promise it's topical. Plus, I need to bring this up at some point."

She took another breath.

"Shizuki Ryouko is dead," she said. "I'm sure you've heard the news. I feel like I should apologize to you, Kyouko, since she was your pupil too. I won't belabor the point: I should have done better for her."

"You did nothing wrong," Kyouko said, looking her in the eye. "I've had time to review what we know. I'll want more details from you later, but it sounds like it was heroic."

Something about her gaze puzzled Mami.

"We both know that's little consolation," Mami said, brushing past the thought.

"Of course," Kyouko said, closing her eyes and tilting her head slightly. "But technically she was lost when the wormhole closed, right? Technically, she's just missing. We don't even have a body."

Mami shook her head, the strange feeling repeating. It wasn't like Kyouko to engage in this kind of denial.

"She's not 'technically' missing," Mami said. "She's already been declared dead. We tracked every wormhole exit in Human space, she didn't make it out."

Kyouko tilted her head in acknowledgment, eyes still closed. Mami had the sense that she didn't believe her.

She looked over at Yuma, hoping for some help, but the girl only watched silently, an unreadable expression on her face.

"Kyouko‐chan," Mami began.

"I know what you're going to say," Kyouko said. "I'm not trying to be in denial here. It's just, in a situation like this, I would want to wait until your visit to the Ribbon to reach any conclusions."

Mami blinked.

"You really think—" she began.

"It doesn't matter," Kyouko interrupted. "Not like I'm going to skip the funeral or anything. You said this was topical somehow, right? How?"

Mami thought for half a second, then decided to let it go. If Kyouko wanted to dodge the topic—well, as she said, it probably didn't matter.

"Well, while Shizuki‐san was at the pulsar, the mystery organ in her brain, the one we've been studying, started to activate," she said. "This is a bit classified, but I'll read you in."

She sent a data extract of what had happened, the interactions with the aliens, the information Ryouko had extracted, and the way it had enabled the final gambit at the pulsar, even if it had ended tragically. She waited while they absorbed it.

"In fact," Mami added eventually, "that information—what little we were able to analyze of it on such short notice—was what you were able to use to activate the blink drive in your own battle. I hardly think I need to remind you all that Valentin was responsible for the brain organ in the first place. So here Homura is again manipulating events, even when it involves the aliens. How is she able to do something like that?"

"And then she let that invaluable asset be destroyed," Yuma said, closing her eyes for a moment. "That's why you can't believe she's really dead, right? Kyouko‐nee‐chan? Homura wouldn't do something like that. It would be not only immoral, but inefficient."

Kyouko's eyes widened slightly, and she took a moment to finish biting through the bun she had acquired from a passing drone aboard *Megane*.

"That was part of it," she said. "But not the main part. I'll be blunt: Ryouko was an instrument of the Goddess. More than just what Homura would do, I don't think the Goddess would let someone like her die so needlessly."

"I know your point of view," Yuma said, shaking her head. "But from the point of view of pure practicality, we can't even rule out Homura having other agents with the same brain organ. I'd like actual verification before we start making any wild assumptions."

"I'm not even asking you to believe me," Kyouko said. "I *said* it was just a feeling."

They glared at each other for a bit, and Mami knew better than to intervene.

She waited a dozen or so seconds, then moved on:

"I just wanted to bring it to your attention," Mami said, "for the next time Homura's fingerprints show up on a situation. I have a feeling it won't take long."

---

#### *Elsewhere, earlier.*

The Thinkers claimed not to share the human notion of *emotions*, but as Clarisse pointed out, that didn't mean they couldn't be *surprised*. The word retained meaning even in a world of prediction bounds and errors.

Ryouko wondered if she really understood that meaning, watching Peace‐cultivating comprehend the truth.

*`μν·Your pref‐spec proves that the substantial details of your claims, and those of Divine‐seeking, are honest|μ·I require time to rebuild my world‐understanding ≈ Thinker who first comprehended the sky|ν·We must conclude Consensus/Thinker‐preserving is outside both prediction and measurement bounds|ν+·Such unprecedented error endangers the entire Consensus`*

The alien's body evinced no distress, nor did its telepathy carry any, despite the dire language.

Ryouko almost felt jealous. All she wanted to do now was collapse into bed and recuperate. Did the aliens even *have* proper beds? Did they even sleep? The main risk of extended consciousness for magical girls was increased emotional instability, after all.

*`|μ·You will need basic cultural grounding, but you will need to rest and repair your combat‐body first|∈ν·We must synchronize with Consensus/Ahimsa‐extending as soon as possible to consider further actions|∈ν·We can plan corrective measures when we reach Andromeda‐Bar‐One|μ+·Perhaps not a combat‐body—perhaps‒83% even a first‐body.`*

Before Ryouko could respond, she sensed…

*Grief cubes?* she thought, incredulous.

A drone rolled out of a circular hole in the wall, transparent tendrils growing fluidly upward, cradling some kind of magically‐endowed hollow sphere. Grief cubes, indeed.

*`|μ·Divine‐seeking indicated you would need certain items for maintenance, and provided this special container|||ξ·We would like to ask later about this technology`*

Ryouko did not relish having to explain, nor did she wholly trust Homura's judgment in giving these aliens access to something so secret. But, well, grief cubes were grief cubes, and this way she was less likely to just *die*.

*||||ξ·Given the situation my species is in…*

She didn't finish the thought, and worried that the alien would not understand, but a specific sense of comprehension, a "completed‐your‐thought", came via one telepathic header.

*`·Divine‐seeking indicated that there may be an issue with the consumed waste products, and that you should provide them to us so that we may eject them into deep space|●·Understandable|·As this matter has, we suspect, some relation to your reality‐warping, it is likely that /Ahimsa‐extending, and the Consensus itself, will have questions about it in the future, and it may be in both our interests for you to speak||`*

It paused, and then when Ryouko offered no reply:

*`·For now, rest, recuperate, and learn about our society|+·Improved understanding will be necessary for later negotiations, and we predict‒97% our sharing of information will increase trust as well|+∪·e7FpscJ⊃Lush‐botanist will provide you all you need to know|+∪·Query the ship telepathically, from anywhere within, to learn`*

It gestured at a featureless part of the wall, and Ryouko became aware of *something* there, lurking behind the walls, telepathically ready.

*`·We have prepared accommodations for you nearby, though you are free to explore||·Lush‐botanist will assist your movement|`*

The alien folded its tentacles in front of it at the same time.

*`|ৡ·A traditional indication of departure||·My regards to Clarisse⊃??? as well`*

Then, it headed out the rounded doorway of the medical bay.

---

Ryouko would have loved to move straight into learning more about the aliens. Could have, if she had spent magic on quick‐repair, now that she had more grief cubes.

Instead, she inspected her accommodations.

She had only realized after Peace‐cultivating's departure, but the enchanted grief cube container she'd been given had no obvious mechanism for opening. Presumably there was some way to get the cubes out, but rather than confront that puzzle, she had simply accepted the ship's offer to roll her medical bed into her room. Her bed's legs had detached from the floor to reveal rubber‐like rolling balls, which spun on their own and gripped the slightly‐curved floor well.

The small room she had now arrived in was, in a way, remarkably straightforward. There was a cushioned place to lie down, curved like a hammock. There were lights built into the walls, a source of water, and a synthesizer, all of which identified themselves for her on probing—though on the unfamiliar channel of telepathy. She reached down a hand from her bed to feel the floor—it had a strange, rough texture that reminded her of sand, and it gave way slightly when she pressed it. Odd, but not unpleasant.

All in all, the room could have plausibly been passed off as designed for a human, were it not for the poles that surrounded the cushioned area—meant for curling your tentacles around when sleeping or resting, apparently.

That wasn't enough of a difference to matter to her, and with that decided she discarded her spacesuit, finally dispelling her transformation with all its frills, letting the pieces fall off in chunks onto the floor.

She requested that her medical bed roll next to the cushions and then, with a tremendous effort, she rolled herself off, landing face‐first into what felt like—and sounded like—some kind of mushy water bed. Not exactly human cushions after all, then.

She had *just* enough presence of mind left to drag the bumpy blanket she was lying on out from under her, before passing out.

---

It was nearly a week before she woke again, groggy, but in a body much further from death. A quick glance at herself showed that her healing and repair—not magically‐assisted, to conserve grief cubes—was well enough along, with far fewer gangrenous spots on her skin.

The tattered remains of her clothes looked rather worse, but thankfully for her sense of decency, the alien cushions seemed to have quietly digested the blood and other stains she had left behind.

She couldn't help but be a bit bewildered at having been unconscious so long, and ran a number of detailed systems checks, which verified that she was, indeed, just recently fit again for the world of the living.

Superficially, she didn't feel much different than if she had awoken from a really long nap, though the readouts suggested there was plenty of neurochemical modulation to thank for that. Best to take one thing at a time, she thought.

Still lying down, but now facing up, she picked up the sphere Homura had left her with both hands, placing it down on her belly.

Her movements felt better. She realized only in retrospect that even her arms and hands had been stiff before, relying far too heavily on magic.

Also, now that she wasn't critically damaged, she finally realized how the device must work. Like any permanently enchanted object, it required magic to operate—when she provided a tiny spark, the sphere split open, revealing the empty grief cubes within.

Between these, and those she had left over in her spacesuit—still strewn in parts across the floor, silently self‐repairing—she had enough for several months of pure bodily maintenance.

Theoretically, anyway. She had limited training on controlling her unconscious magic usage that tightly, and no way to look up any helpful materials on the matter.

*I have some MSY guidelines and training exercises preloaded,* Clarisse thought, *for whatever survival scenario a magical girl might encounter.*

Ryouko wondered to herself whether they had any advice on how not to freak out when your life was suddenly turned inside out.

Most likely, now that she thought about it.

*I'd start by using some grief cubes,* Clarisse thought, a bit insistently.

She did.

Her gem had been disconcertingly dark, although not dangerously so.

She looked down again at her clothes. While she wanted very much to spend some magic to instantly repair them, she couldn't justify it to herself. Instead, and with reluctance, she extracted herself from the alien water‐cushions and made her way over to the alien clothes hanging on the opposite wall.

It turned out she had been given a one‐piece robe, suitable for covering her from head to foot, with cutouts for her limbs. Exactly what one might expect of aliens, now that she thought about it.

She removed her old clothes, which joined her spacesuit on the floor, and put on the robe. Again, she was surprised by the texture of the alien material—the inside of the robe was covered with all sorts of tiny ridges and bumps in various patterns.

As she dialed down her pain management she was also surprised, and rather displeased, to realize that the air in her room was nearly forty degrees Celsius, and what felt like one hundred percent humidity.

*More oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, and water vapor than on Earth,* Clarisse thought. *Higher gravity and atmospheric pressure, too. But well within habitability range! Acheron was worse, really, except for the humidity.*

Ryouko got the sense Clarisse was quite worried about her.

And… well, she was doing all she could do to distract herself from the immensity of where she was and what had happened. It had begun creeping into her mind just seconds after she truly awoke. She was healthy enough now, she had time, she could think—so where did she even begin? What was she even supposed to do?

At least she knew what *not* to do right now: think at all about how Asami might be doing. She needed to keep her gem clean.

*Have you been awake this whole time?* she asked instead.

*Not precisely, but I've been able to make do by rotating parts of my body through repair fugue, allowing for consistent information processing. So, mostly unconscious, but still watching out.*

*I'm not sure how to feel about that, but thank you,* Ryouko thought.

Ultimately, there wasn't much for Clarisse to report. She believed they had been traveling at FTL most of the time Ryouko was in fugue, with a couple Blinks and several wormhole traversals, judging by the glow of Ryouko's gem upon her ring—an inexact science, at best. Clarisse couldn't access the ship's telepathic consoles, so she had been unable to ask for confirmation.

But Clarisse *had* had plenty of time to review the MSY survival guidelines and consider their situation. Given that they weren't in immediate danger, and that they had no way to signal for help, best practice said that the next step was figuring out just what kind of environment you had gotten yourself stuck into.

Peace‐cultivating had been right, Ryouko thought. First, she needed to learn.

So she started querying the ship.

After getting the basics out of the way—they were already deep in the core of the Milky Way, the ship was alone and stealthed, and there was no news to share—she attempted to dig into several technical topics. But one thing became clear quickly: while the aliens here may have seemed friendly enough, they still weren't about to hand her technological secrets, with all her queries in that direction politely turned aside.

It was frustrating—the smothering, *trapped* sensation of blink interdiction at the pulsar still hung in the back of her mind, but she couldn't get the ship to tell her anything about how it worked.

She did receive one welcome concession, at least, in the form of explicit permission to be present in the engine room during blinks.

With that to look forward to, Ryouko turned her attention to the subject she had been instructed to ask about in the first place.

*?·What is the Consensus* she thought.

*`μ∈·The organizational center of Thinker society, arbitrating disputes between Tentacles and making species‐wide decisions, using openly‐verifiable preference‐integration and exchange‐mediation|μ∈·The organization maintaining peace between all empathize‐open‐compliant Tentacles since planetary unification, about ten thousand homeworld‐years ago|ν·Not, in my personal opinion, an ideal system, but one which has suited the needs of our people, and which could not be overturned without significant turmoil, were such a revolution even possible`*

Ryouko paused. She wasn't used to personal opinions being expressed in this kind of search; she supposed the aliens did things differently. Moreover, she was asking the ship directly, rather than some kind of Infopedia interface.

Still, she decided to press forward.

There were so many questions to ask, including the tempting option to ask the ship for what might be a dangerous political opinion, but she needed to stay focused.

First, a question of measurement: What was ten thousand "homeworld‐years" ago in human terms? Apparently, around 7×10<sup>54</sup> Planck times, which Clarisse quickly calculated was about twelve thousand human years, around the dawn of agriculture. Shockingly close to human unification, in astronomical time.

*|μ?·What are Tentacles|* she followed up with, getting to the core of the matter.

*`μ∈·A Tentacle is a grouping of individuals with broadly similar pref‐specs, focused on providing its members with a lifestyle and society suitable to their tastes|μ∈·A Tentacle is a branch of the Thinker species recognized by the Consensus, bound by certain responsibilities and afforded certain rights and resources|μ+·As an example, I and all individuals aboard me are members of Consensus/Ahimsa‐extending, a Tentacle devoted towards the custodianship of all life|ν+·Living as a ship is not characteristic of /Ahimsa‐extending—indeed, most ships in our territory are members of /Star‐faring—but I am more amenable to it than most, and as this mission is critical to /Ahimsa‐extending's interests, I volunteered`*

Ryouko frowned, wrinkling her brow. Did it just say…

*||?ν∈·You are an upload|?ν∈·You are originally organic* she asked, feeling a bit crass, but knowing it likely didn't matter here.

*`||ν·Indeed|ν+·The creation of a Thinker aligned to an instrumental task is dispreferred by the Consensus, and avoided when at all possible—instead, Thinkers who are already suited to the task are recruited, incentivized to reproduce, or even, in extremis, permitted to multiply; /Star‐faring is an example of the second case`*

*`||ν·Thus, the creation of Clarisse⊃??? is bitter to me—to be both preference‐bound to you and unable to use telepathy… many among /Ahimsa‐extending will be less willing to cooperate with you once they learn of this|v+·I am eager to assist in building an independent body for Clarisse⊃??? to operate in, though of course any such procedure would be complicated, and I know it would unease you both`*

*Wow this is definitely not a question I am ready for,* Clarisse thought, a few seconds later. *The thought of physical independence is nice, but I'm terrified to be detached from you, especially at the hands of, uh, Cephalopods. Politely pass for now. You don't need to tell them that.*

When Ryouko didn't say anything, Lush‐Botanist simply continued on.

*`μ·To understand us, it is important to understand that the Tentacles are not an emergent feature of our society, but an intentional response to the development of empathize‐opening and its consequences|μ+·Tentacles, and the Consensus of them, aim to prevent a repeat of the cataclysmic conflict on our homeworld, Great Sea||`*

She appreciated the ship's attempts to explain, but she still didn't understand the biggest question in her mind, which was how Consensus/Ahimsa‐extending could be seemingly so unaware of what Consensus/Thinker‐preserving was doing to Humanity in the Contact War.

The answer clearly lay in asking more detailed questions about the organization of the Consensus, but Ryouko found her attention drawn to the "cataclysmic conflict" the ship had mentioned. It *had* to be important.

Sociocultural topics were always maddeningly entangled, she thought, especially when every answer you got was embedded into an exotic, unknown cultural context.

So she asked about the conflict.

*`μ·The development of empathize‐opening allowed governing bodies, and later individuals, to clearly read pref‐specs and predict behavior|ν·A genocide against all who opposed empathize‐opening's use to reveal pref‐specs which were dangerous or long‐term incompatible, fiercely fought, nearly ending in extinction|μν·Empathize‐open‐compliance was enforced by some Thinker societies to identify unaligned individuals and to demand harmonizing changes in pref‐spec, but many individuals and even entire societies death‐preferred such use—a preference that was often honored|ν+·Nearing defeat, empathize‐open‐enforcers resorted to anathemic weapons; few survived the aftermath, but those who did completed the genocide, reducing our population to only nine hundred and seventy`*

Ryouko swallowed. Without any emotional affect to judge by, she couldn't tell if Lush‐Botanist disapproved of this act.

The ship continued:

*`|ν·Strict new rules and limitations were adopted via BiPAA, along with empathize‐open‐compliance|u·The survivors eventually organized themselves into Tentacles, appendages of their new Consensus—each composed of individuals with similar pref‐specs, each empowered to build their own preferred society within harmonious bounds|u+·/Ahimsa‐extending was only founded thousands of homeworld‐years later; recovery of technological civilization on the ruined Great Sea ≈ drinking the ocean alone`*

And then the ship waited, clearly expecting Ryouko to ask something.

Where should she even start?

*μ·So the Consensus is a super‐organization of Tentacles, each of which is a group of Thinkers with similar pref‐specs|μ+·And each Tentacle lives in its own society and region of space|ν?·Tentacle independence is why you do not know the activities of /Thinker‐preserving|*

*`μ·That's correct|μ·That's incorrect; Tentacles may share or not share societies and space, depending on their pref‐specs|ν+·/Thinker‐preserving has values very different from us, frankly somewhat contradictory|ν·We do not have much contact with them, and /Thinker‐preserving has been delegated all interaction with your species`*

*||ν?·So how does the Consensus deal with such contradictions|* Ryouko thought. *||ν?·How can you trust each other|*

She was slipping back into linear thought, she realized, but she didn't want to multiplex this topic.

*`ν+·With this, we can build reliable models of each other's behavior even if we do not share values; there are secrets, there are lies, but there are lines that should not be possible to cross||ν·Empathize‐opening is key; you have practiced as much with Peace‐cultivating; it provides prediction bounds for faction behavior, and allows the Consensus itself to govern with preference‐equity|`*

The ship paused, sending a token of anticipation.

*They want you to empathize‐open them,* Clarisse thought. *Remember, the ship is an upload too, and not like human AIs. They probably expect you to treat them more like someone standing in front of you.*

Her thought didn't carry any air of reproach, but Ryouko still felt embarrassed. It just hadn't occurred to her.

Just as she had earlier, she made the unfamiliar request, forming an intent she barely understood in her mind. This time, she found it a bit easier, and was better prepared for the information that flooded into her mind. She quickly realized she could answer her earlier question, now: 13Yi4GLa⊃Lush‐Botanist disapproved of the genocide committed on their homeworld long ago, though she only disapproved of the means, not the goal of empathize‐open‐compliance. On the whole, she seemed to be fairly similar to Peace‐cultivating, though more social and much more into raising and being around plants.

*Just like Asami,* Ryouko thought.

That unbidden realization swept a wave of loneliness through her. Here she was, Goddess knew where, and would she ever—

She cut off the line of thought, swallowing her fears. Her situation was far, far better than it had any right to be under the circumstances.

Like with Peace‐cultivating before, Ryouko found that she now had a better ability to predict Lush‐Botanist's behavior, including that the alien probably would love to talk about plants, were she to ask.

Well, "love" was the wrong word, but…

*Perhaps next time,* she thought.

*?·So then what is happening with /Thinker‐preserving|?·What does it mean for /Thinker‐preserving to be outside prediction bounds|?·Can you not predict what /Thinker‐preserving are doing*

*`·We do not know; our discovery attempts ≈ peering into the deep|·The behavior you are reporting simply does not match the group pref‐spec of their Tentacle, even assuming large environmental variability and the presence of prodigious secrets|·There are pref‐specs which would predict the behavior you and Divine‐seeking report, but we have not observed them while performing pref‐spec‐verification upon /Thinker‐preserving`*

Ryouko felt the mental tingle of incoming information, and Clarisse quickly helped her unpackage what turned out to be yet another pref‐spec—but this time, for a third party.

*`μ·This is a pref‐spec spectrum for /Thinker‐Preserving|μ+·Your empathy‐organ will not be able to perform a truly detailed analysis—we've been running our analyses on some of our largest computing centers, and taking into account the spectrums of /Thinker‐preserving's allied Tentacles—but it should be illustrative|ν·I am running a new analysis with the information you have given, but it does not change the result that the actions you report are out of bounds|ν+·Perhaps, with your secrets, you will reach a different conclusion`*

Ryouko frowned, taking a moment to figure out how to do what the ship was suggesting. The /Thinker‐preserving faction was indeed very different from /Ahimsa‐extending. It weighed the lives of Thinker individuals far higher than those of other species, sapient or not. This was arguably the faction's dominant aspect, but not to the point of monomaniacism—it still valued other species *somewhat*.

And as Lush‐Botanist had said, their behavior did not match, even given Ryouko's greater knowledge of it. Lying to the rest of the Consensus about Human ability to upload, refusal to engage in diplomacy even after military reversals—these were not behaviors that aided the survival of the species. *Either* species.

*|||ν·My results are the same as yours* she thought.

*`||ν∈·That is unfortunate, but not unexpected|ν∈·Perhaps then we are truly deceived`*

*μ?·What are you going to do|μ+?·And what role will I play in it||*

Lush‐Botanist paused for more than a second, sending an empty token to make clear it was deliberate.

*`μ·We will bring this new information back to the sector of space our Tentacle controls, and there decisions will be made|μ·We will‒100% bring this matter to the Consensus|ν·I understand from your pref‐spec that you desire to rejoin your life‐partner, but I must impress upon you the importance of testifying to your experiences|ν+·The ability to empathize‐open you directly will‒91% be essential in ensuring investigative action gets taken|μ+·You could have deduced our actions yourself if you had queried your models|ξ·While most of our Tentacle will trust those of us on the ship due to preference‐alignment, other factions will be much more skeptical, knowing our willingness to lie to protect human life`*

It took Ryouko a bit to untangle the complicated lines of thought, and when she finally did, she knew what she had to ask.

*|μ?·Do you think the Consensus can solve this, even if they believe me||||*

The ship was silent again.

*`|μ·I do not know; the situation is unprecedented||||`*

---

"Everyone knows the Ancients run their own show whenever they're given half a chance, but this is absolutely too much. I can understand keeping away from Governance, given the circumstances, but we have our own institutions for a reason! The Black Heart was not founded so that Ancients could run off and try to run missions on their own. With a bit more responsibility and care, these casualties might have been avoided. Instead, these matriarchs thought they'd try their hands at running their own pocket battleship. In case anyone needs reminding, we have regulations forbidding that kind of activity."

Mila Brankovic, of course, and if her tone was a bit more measured, reflecting the seriousness of the situation, it had lost none of its ideological sting. The face of anti‐establishment politics in the MSY, Mila was all but salivating at the chance to make her point about the politically‐vulnerable Founders—especially when so much of the oft‐disengaged younger generation of magical girls was finally paying attention.

Mami turned her gaze towards Yuma's avatar, a few seats down from her at the table. They were nearly all virtual here, except the chair, Odette François.

"First off, some of us don't even have children," Yuma said, doing an able job of hiding any annoyance she might harbor. "Second, I don't need to be reminded why I founded the Black Heart. I helped write those regulations. I know what disasters prompted them. But we've already explained our reasons for secrecy. We still don't know who broke into the TCF, only that it must have been done by magical means. I had to try to keep it to those we knew to trust, AI or otherwise. It was a valid use of Executive discretion, as I think this body will affirm."

Leadership Committee meetings—even virtual ones—were normally held in the ornate Crown Room, high atop the latest iteration of the Executive Tower in Mitakihara. This meeting, however, wasn't technically a full committee meeting—this was a fact‐finding commission of the Intelligence subcommittee, headed by the venerable Odette François and held instead in a grotto buried deep underground in Paris.

Which did not make it *not* ornate. Kyouko liked to call it the "Foot Room".

"We will see," Odette said. "How did you know who to trust? How was that decision made?"

As chair, Odette was obliged to stay relatively neutral in her questioning.

Yuma, for her part, was still broadcasting from the ship she shared with Kyouko and Kana, still on its way to Earth.

"Frankly, personal ties," Yuma said. "Along with AI vetting. We had to establish circles of trust. That carried some real costs in terms of outcome, but I don't claim that there were no errors of judgment."

"And just what were those errors of judgment?" Odette asked.

"We underestimated the amount of personal risk," Yuma said, "and overestimated how powerful we really were. I didn't seriously consider the possibility that we would be attacked the way we were; as it turned out, even with extra help from Sakura‐san, we barely escaped with our lives. If I had consulted with her earlier, or even with Tomoe‐san, the Black Heart, or the Far Seers, things might have gone better. But it was still a rather unlikely possibility. And we still do not know who may be compromised."

"To be clear about what that means," Mila said. "When you say things might have gone better, that means we wouldn't have lost the site, or whatever evidence might have still been there. With more official resources that might have all been avoided. We all understand what you're saying about secrecy, but this kind of 'picking only my trusted friends' is exactly the kind of mindset I've been complaining about! We *do* screen those with high‐level clearance."

"And yet she didn't leak prematurely," Mami said in defense. "That was by far the most important thing, and Chitose‐san managed that. That shouldn't be ignored."

"But she lost key members," Clarisse van Rossum said, voice projecting down the length of the table. "Some of the dead are not easily replaced. Nor are we really sure she didn't leak. How was she attacked in the first place? We don't know, but it certainly didn't look like a normal alien attack! You cannot make these assumptions."

Mami hid a grimace, and swallowed what she had been about to say. Van Rossum rarely ever spoke in meetings, and they had gotten one of her friends killed.

The rebuke was obvious. Clarisse had claimed to be too busy to meet in advance. Up until now, she had looked impassive. Clarisse had been in the loop with Yuma initially, but had been excluded later due to her Cult membership, which probably contributed to her reaction here. Mami had thought there would be a chance to apologize after the meeting.

It seemed Clarisse was not having any of that.

"There's no downplaying the losses we've suffered here," Kuroi Kana said, addressing Van Rossum levelly. "Both in personnel and losing the asteroid itself. But that's different from asserting events could have gone any better. Even if we had asked Tomoe‐san for a small armada—and that's a big if, given the strain on military resources—remember that the asteroid was a trap. The aliens probably would have blown it up early if they saw us approaching in such force."

"That's speculative, though I take the point," Mila said, responding to Kana. "We can't know for sure."

"It's clear they were all operating under very low‐information conditions," Shizuki Sayaka said. "Just because they didn't get a perfect outcome doesn't mean they didn't do well. The purpose of this meeting isn't to point fingers."

"But it *is* to fact‐find, and to interrogate how we could have done better," Van Rossum said. "It's hardly adequate to just sit and say we did our best."

It was hard to miss the pleased expression that spread across Mila's face, which she wasn't even bothering to hide. Having Clarisse's support on the issue was a coup, even if she hadn't any hand in it.

"That's correct," Mami said, pitching her own voice over the table. "We must do better in the future. It's clear the organization hasn't been paying enough attention to matters of quite serious import. Not to put too fine a point on it, but we shouldn't be relying on ships belonging to the Cult and personal resources to do any of this. At least not after what has happened."

Her gaze met Clarisse and Mila in turn. She had not been part of Yuma and Kyouko's adventure, so she could speak with some degree of apparent independence. *Some*.

Both Clarisse and Mila seemed content to let her lay her cards on the table, even if Mila's look suggested she looked forward to quite possibly lighting them on fire.

Mami took a moment to reflect.

None of them had gotten this far without a head for politics, and they all knew it didn't have to be a zero‐sum game. Not always, not even between rivals. It was about crafting the right proposal.

"It's not as if we don't have ships, don't have personnel, don't have resources," Mami said. "I've spoken to everyone involved in the expedition, and they've agreed that this should all be brought aboveboard. I propose we make an official MSY task force of it, by which I mean the whole effort, which at this point consists of helping Governance track down and exterminate these conspirators. This is not just a matter of finding them in deep space or what‐have‐you—there was clearly magical involvement, which makes it *our* purview. Governance has every right to be very unhappy with us right now."

She paused for a moment, looking around, then continued.

"As for key personnel, we can involve the existing subject matter experts, acknowledging the mistakes that have already been made. It should be done with official auspices and review this time, and I personally think it would be best if we had unity on this. Thus, we could avoid too much envelopment in the existing matriarchies by including Brankovic as one of the directors. Clarisse too, if you'd have it."

It was about as naked a proposal as she could make: Let's come together on this and I'll make sure all of you have some influence. As such, the room stood still for a moment, lines of virtual avatars gazing at Mila and Clarisse for their responses.

Mila leaned forward, putting her hands under her chin and closing her eyes for a moment.

"That's an interesting offer," she said, her demeanor abruptly reserved. "Even if intended as a bit of a distraction from your friends' performance. I agree that something *must* be done, and if so, it would go against my principles to turn down an official task force, since that would doubtless mean you all would keep investigating on your own anyway."

She paused, letting the tension build for a few seconds.

"What do you think, Van Rossum?" she asked, turning. "I am prepared to accept, provided we can agree on the particulars, but I respect your opinion on the matter."

"It sounds like a good idea to me, and I'd like to keep a more serious eye on what's going on," Clarisse said.

The table relaxed, and the trio of Mila's followers looked at each other meaningfully—all four of them shared a physical location, which meant they were doubtlessly coordinating telepathically.

Mila placed her hands on the table.

"I'll have the most stringent requirements here. Most of the outlines of the arrangement are obvious, as you realize as well. We'll include Chitose and Kuroi and report to this subcommittee, and I will insist on formalizing any arrangements we make to use Matriarchy resources, and I'd like to include Mohana and some others as well—I'll provide a list. But what will be the involvement of the Cult here? Their resource contribution is of course appreciated, but for them to be setting policy…"

"The Church would be given a role," Kyouko said, holding up a piece of toast. "We wouldn't support this initiative otherwise. That's unless you want us poking around ourselves. We have a mission here, and I hope you can see the common cause."

"I consider it nonsense to have an initiative like this without the involvement of the Church," Clarisse said. "Besides, I would be involved in any case, so it would be an odd hang‐up to have."

Mila nodded, giving way in the face of so forceful a response. Even she couldn't risk making a true political enemy of the Cult—while its reputation outside the MSY had just taken a hit, on the inside it had far too many members. In a low‐engagement democracy, the Cult motivated a powerful and growing voting bloc that could not be safely alienated.

Thus far, Kyouko had kept the Cult mostly apolitical, but the Cult made a point of encouraging its members to vote and held regular voting drives. Kyouko had played a key role in keeping Homura's coalition in power during its most tenuous years in the twenty‐second century, and she clearly wasn't above reminding people of what she might achieve.

"What about the existing committees?" Mila asked, a long moment later. "The ones about X‐25 and the grief cube supply issues. That work is ongoing, but the logical thing would be to fold that work into this new task force. Especially considering how much seems to have been going on outside their purview."

"I'd propose the same," Mami said.

"What about Akemi Homura?" Clarisse asked, clasping her hands in front of her. "Officially, we gave up the search for her well over a decade ago, but the members of this committee know it's never truly stopped, and that's not even taking into account the Church's efforts. Given all we've learned now, she seems directly relevant to every topic here, especially now that one of her alleged former agents was involved in the pulsar mission. Are we going to officially acknowledge that?"

That was a very good question, and one that Mami hadn't been able to make up her mind on. It seemed almost ludicrous to ask a public task force to pretend Homura wasn't a part of their purview, but officially restarting the search for Homura would drive the rumor mills crazy—even if they were already pretty crazy.

But was that even a bad thing? What did admitting Homura's presence really hurt in the end?

"That's a bad idea," Kyouko said, before Mami could reply. "It's clear Homura has her reasons for being secretive, and I don't think it's wise to step all over that."

"With all due respect, is this because you think she has some sort of special insight?" Mila asked. "I respect the beliefs of our members, and acknowledge Akemi Homura's prodigious accomplishments, but without any idea what she is doing or why, we can't be sure she is sane. Do you have information suggesting otherwise?"

Kyouko started to rear up, but Mami intervened.

"I do," she said. "Based on what I encountered near Carthago station, I think she's sane enough, though I can't vouch for much more than that."

It was a bald‐faced lie, but she couldn't come out and say that she was actually drawing on her interaction with Kyouko's—Homura's—Goddess.

"However," she continued, turning towards Kyouko. "I don't think that's a reason we should necessarily just fall in line with her. We can't just wave our hands and trust her. She might need our help someday."

They had touched base on the topic beforehand, so Kyouko knew better than to interrupt. They appeared to be in a bit of conflict—but Mami wasn't going to tread on Kyouko's wishes.

"I will share the details of that with the committee afterward," Mami said, turning back towards the table. "In the meantime, I think it is wrongheaded to make this decision based on what we think *Akemi‐san* is doing and whether we agree with it. Rather, we should base our decision on the needs of the organization. My personal opinion is that while the task force may pursue Akemi‐san on a classified basis, it is too early to let the public in on that, because we simply do not have enough information. Let's wait until we have something a bit more concrete to say than 'Akemi Homura seems to be running a shadow organization of magical girls that we thought were dead'. I can't imagine a more fertile ground for mistrust and conspiracy theory."

Another bluff, since she had no intention of providing any real useful details about the Goddess, but for now she had command of the conversation, she thought.

"Let's not close the book on that decision," Clarisse said, interjecting right when Mami least expected. "I can agree with not revealing anything right now, but let's not overlook the advantages it might bring. After all, the rogue faction working against us has had every chance to publicize Akemi and has chosen not to. That's suggestive on its own; the public might like the idea of Akemi and a faction of her agents working from the shadows, if we portray it positively."

"They might like the idea, but I don't," Mila said. "We should not be endorsing a rogue group, not even one led by Akemi. The MSY has embarrassed itself enough lately–Governance hasn't exactly been subtle about pinning the TCF breach on us and our inability to police our own."

"Let's just save this topic for later," Mami said, raising a hand. "At least until we get more information."

She stopped, looking at Odette and Mila to see if they had anything further to add.

They didn't, so Mami nodded at Odette to indicate she was done.

Suiting her role as chairman, Odette had avoided commenting on the matter herself, though she had made her opinions well known in advance.

"Governance is right about one thing: it really is about policing our own, and it's time we took care of our own business," Odette commented. "Like it or not, this is something only we can do."

She paused, looking out over the table, then continued:

"Still, with regard to the original purpose of the meeting, is the intent that we are to delegate further corrective action to this task force?"

"I think the extra layer of supervision will be corrective action enough," Mila said, smiling vaguely.

After all, she had little chance of, say, stripping Yuma of her position or anything more serious, Mami thought dryly.

"Very well," Odette said. "We'll leave it to the task force itself to propose its budget and scope in a future meeting. Clarisse, you can take the lead on that, if you don't object? Schedule it sometime within the next twenty‐four hours?"

"That's fine," Clarisse said.

"Then let's prepare for the open‐door session."

Chiyo Rika tapped her foot thoughtfully, taking a swig of the fizzy grape‐flavored drink she had ordered from her synthesizer, field reports flitting by her mind's eye.

These were interesting times, and the internal media of the MSY were in a frenzy of activity, echoing the MSY organization itself. There was far too much to report on, far too many topics to cover: the ins and outs of political debates in the senior committees, the shocking behavior of celebrity leaders—striking out on their own and almost getting themselves killed!—plus a bevy of human interest stories through Human space. There was also the aftermath of the pulsar mission, with plenty of heroic deaths to report.

Those weren't even the biggest stories. Besides the whale in the pool of the TCF breach itself, there was also the fallout from the cloning scandal. Much of the MSY had been well aware of the cloning program, but that still left the newest contractees and a meaningful proportion of the veterans. And then there was the general public.

And then there were the investigations already in progress, task force or not, into the unknown magical girls that had appeared throughout Mitakihara, and in the vicinity of other key locations that had experienced attacks: Paris, DC, Imperia. There was the Cult's seemingly precognitive reaction to the attack on Prometheus, and their claims regarding it. There was whatever Yuma and her associates had found on their deadly excursion, whose details were still quite vague.

The disparate, unruly, and popular internal media were jumping between stories like a drunken teleporter, unable to digest and react to everything at once.

That was where she came in. As *the* Chiyo Rika—and a teetotal teleporter, thank you very much—her opinions carried outsized weight. So did the reporting done by her small media outfit. Enough to occasionally drive the narrative, when she was compelling enough.

It was a fulfilling job, at least for her: exercising discretion over which stories to highlight, and which to file away, always trying to see the forest for the trees, teasing out the underlying causes and rippling effects within the omnipresent noise.

Right now, the main news focus was on the cloning program and the TCF breach—Governance's response to it, the MSY's involvement, and the various disasters, in particular the one in Mitakihara. There was another big topic—the various personal revelations about Chitose Yuma, Shizuki Ryouko, and so forth—but that wasn't an actively developing story, and so was slowly being drowned out by everything else. Governance had quickly admitted that most of the core facts were true, if twisted and exaggerated, while convincingly denying the rest, blunting the story's momentum.

For the cloning program, her preference was simple: she didn't have the prejudice against cloning much of the younger generations did, and she would do what she could to make sure no one was mistreated because of it. She didn't view this as a political matter, but a moral one, and planned to preach acceptance.

The disastrous handling of the TCF breach was much more complex, and she preferred a clean, factual approach for now. Not only would that avoid stepping on any toes, it was her opinion that any editorial slant would do the topic a disservice—the people needed their heads clear on this one, for better or worse.

She flicked through the images in her mind, scrolling towards something she had seen just a few minutes ago.

There was an interesting angle to the loss of the Cult HQ in Mitakihara. The reports she received had made for eyebrow‐raising reading, except for the fact that they came from the Cult itself. Still, the religion was a source of comfort for many, and their Theological Council had come out very quickly in defense of the cloning program, which appealed to her.

She had seen a few takes already: on the miraculously low number of casualties in the tower collapse, with a few suitable nods in the direction of the Cult's beliefs. The right material for a hope spot, she thought. But that wasn't what she was interested in…

Ah, there it was: a tentative report on intense activity around the Cult's former headquarters, where the Ribbon was now underneath a tent, still safely ensconced in its forcefield. Visitor interest had become so intense that the Cult had chosen, in its cleanup, to prioritize clearing a path to it.

Rika pursed her lips. She had, of course, thoroughly perused the recent… unofficial releases of information, claiming that Shizuki Ryouko, among others, was a mere puppet of the Cult and its Ribbon. While the source wasn't exactly unbiased, it *was* odd, in retrospect, how reluctant the Cult had always been to claim an affiliation with her, despite clear evidence of a relationship–this, from an organization that was usually eager to claim credit for everything.

Almost all information about the girl was second‐hand—the girl's mentors had shielded her to the point where she had managed to go her entire life without giving a single interview. Still, it seemed clear she was a believer—her visits to the Ribbon had been confirmed, at the least.

Rika had done stories on the Ribbon before, and even visited herself once, in the course of due diligence. But perhaps she ought to look again.

She tapped her glass a few times against the table, then set it down, letting the robots get her another drink.

It was the Future, as Governance liked to say, but she was still a believer in old‐school journalism–some of the time anyway. She would send one of her girls on a stakeout, for a few days at a minimum, to get a real sense of the Ribbon and the magical girls reaching out to it.

Who knows what she might find?
