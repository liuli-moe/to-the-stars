## The Bonds that Make Us 

> Among the more eccentric aspects of the magical girl system, the phenomenon of color is among the most easily noticed by the general public, and among the most mysterious. Put simply, besides standard black or white patterning, magical girl costumes are nearly all monochromatic, usually reflecting the hue of the user\'s soul gem, which often, but not always, seems to reflect the personality of the magical girl involved.
>
> Many theories have been advanced to explain this curious phenomenon, both inside and outside the MSY, and none have been even close to proven. Contrary to popular belief, color is only poorly determined by a mage\'s \"favorite\" color. It also doesn\'t seem to be affected by other magical girls in the area at time of contract---examples of both rainbow and single‐color teams exist in the historical record. The correlation between color and type of magical power is weak, and not any stronger than would be expected based on the connection of personality to both color and magical girl. Finally, explanations involving Incubator intent run up immediately against the Incubator refusal to comment. Nor do so‐called polychromats provide any real insight, distributed seemingly randomly among the magical girl population.
>
> Nor do soul gem colors provide any real insight. While costumes are reflective of soul gem color, there is an important, if subtle difference---the costumes only reflect light, while soul gems are luminescent,* and emit light with a characteristic, often highly‐complex spectrum, usually resembling no existing non‐magical material, and dimming with increased use. Careful analysis has yielded little, except for the intriguing observation that the spectrum extends only over the spectrum that may be directly seen by the eye. Girls contracted after the advent of military optical implants exhibit a spectrum that extends into the newly visible near‐infrared and ultraviolet, but not into the additional range that can be viewed with false color.
>
> In the end, it is a mystery. For its part, the MSY maintains a spectrographic database of its members, for research and identification purposes.

> Defeats on the battlefield failed to put the remains of the Freedom Alliance in the mood for surrender, however. The hyperclass oligarchs, by now thoroughly indoctrinated by their own poisonous ideology, placed the blame for failure squarely on the shoulders of their soldiers, declaring that if their soldiers could or would not perform, then they would be modified until they would. In underground laboratories around the world, scientists tinkered with the genomes of vast arrays of clones, designing thicker cranial plating, muscular augments, toxin glands, and whatever else might be expected to improve combat performance, regardless of personal welfare or the source of the genetic modifications.
>
> Perhaps the most disturbing modifications were those made to the brain, the seat of consciousness itself. Some brain regions were enlarged; others were shrunk or deleted entirely, written off as unnecessary in an instrument of war. Empathy, love, fear---all these were unnecessarily evolutionary adaptations that could now be placed squarely in the dustbin of history. The tools of war, these "perfect\" soldiers would not need to ever question their orders, or indeed do anything but show their prowess in combat.
>
> This horrific disregard for basic human dignity showed itself amply in the names of the abominations that would serve as the FA\'s elite soldiers in last stages of the war. Grunts, Tankers---these were not nicknames given by their enemy, but their actual designation, followed of course by a serial number. These soldiers came in different varieties, each shaped by their battlefield role---giant hulks for assault troopers, lithe, giant‐eyed nymphs for snipers. The Tankers were some of the worst, barely more than an out‐sized head on a shrunken body, perfect for connecting directly to the life‐support system of a medium armored vehicle.
>
> While some of these creations were sentient, after a fashion, the nature of such a sentience was loathsome---tied to one task until death, devoid of human or even animal emotions, and each bound irreversibly by its cortical control module to its masters. It is telling that, at the end of the war, there was essentially no resistance to the Emergency Defense Council\'s Decree 224, ordering the summary execution of any FA \"Elites\" found anywhere.

> In the end, the FA spared not even its civilian functions from such "enhancement\"...

\"Good afternoon, madams. Invitations, please?\"

The courteous demand, delivered by a liveried servant as they arrived at the door, startled Ryouko, engrossed as she was listening to the conversation taking place next to her. Her mother had never had a serious chance to talk to Asami before they left Earth, and the woman was certainly making the most of her visit. Sometimes it almost felt like she got along with Asami better than she got along with her daughter.

She gaped up at the doorman for a moment, the tall white hat seeming to throw her for a loop, before Asami intervened to save her.

\"Here,\" Asami said, producing the requested card from within her purse. Stylish and absurdly tiny, the gray bag served no real purpose than to carry the invitation card. It was for show, like Ryouko\'s own somewhat larger white purse, and like so much else in this simulation. That included the formally‐attired doorman and the invitation cards, engraved with serious‐looking text entitling the bearer to the privilege of attending the birthday party of none other than a certain Chitose Yuma, magical girl celebrity.

Such accoutrements were superfluous in the age of nomenclators, and even more superfluous given that they were attending this party in simulation. Really, they could have manifested directly into the ballroom, but that would apparently have been discourteous.

\"She\'s just trying to create a smooth experience for both the virtual and the non‐virtual guests,\" Asami said, as they stepped through the threshold, glancing at Ryouko. \"Stop being such a grump.\"

The girl sidled up to her and grabbed her around the waist, rubbing her head against Ryouko\'s hair. Asami was big on physical intimacy, something Ryouko had acclimated herself to over the past month, but she still wished her... girlfriend would restrain herself a little, especially in front of *her mother.* A part of her suspected, though, that Kuroi Nakase\'s visit was only making Asami more touchy‐feely. It was a form of claiming ownership, a way of proclaiming without words that \"She\'s mine!\"

And recently, the girl had started to evince the disturbing ability to anticipate Ryouko\'s thoughts. Ryouko wasn\'t sure if it was just natural intuition, or if it was evidence of a growing mutual telepathy that apparently developed sometimes between paired magical girls.

Even a month into it, the whole thing still felt odd. It had seemed natural for Asami to follow her to the planet of Eurydome, a low‐gravity world near Optatum crowded with scientific institutes and universities, only half a week of travel time from Earth.

More precisely, it wasn\'t natural so much as deliberately arranged. Joanne Valentin had come to her under the auspices of *Governance: Science and Technology,* which was deeply interested in the possibility of studying Ryouko\'s powers for scientific reasons. If analysis of her power could contribute meaningfully to Humanity\'s technological development, Governance felt that it could be far more valuable than anything she was likely to contribute again on the battlefield, especially considering the risk of her dying in the process.

Now, Governance was aware of Ryouko\'s feelings with regards to various matters. While it would have been optimal for Ryouko to be studied in some facility on Earth---Prometheus or Zeus or a high‐energy physics institute---they were willing to accommodate her stated preference to explore other worlds, and could post her to a colony world with the necessary scientific facilities. In order to facilitate the process, Governance was willing to allow a certain Nakihara Asami to travel with her. With her gravitational powers, it was possible she would even be useful to the experimentation.

It was then that Shizuki Sayaka had explained her presence. While Governance was more than capable of compensating Ryouko for the experience themselves, the MSY preferred to keep their hand in when it came to affairs involving magical girls. MSY Finance would gladly finance her trip, her living arrangements, and her salary, and would even work with Science Division to arrange an apprenticeship position for Asami at one of the botanical institutes. The matriarch also wanted to personally apologize for the unfortunate seduction incident, which had been the meddling of one of her subordinates, apparently.

Of course, it was more than possible that either the scientists or Ryouko would lose interest in the relationship after a while. At that point, Finance would be glad to offer her a position in one of their offices should she so desire, especially given a certain aptitude she had shown in school for economic matters. The compensation could be quite high.

Ryouko, not being naïve, could easily see the arrangement for what it was, at least from Shizuki Sayaka\'s perspective. Yet, she could also perceive how well it was crafted. Both Governance and the MSY had tons of surveillance data on her, and had created a plan to suit everyone\'s interests---Asami could leave the front and live her dreams, they could both go to an alien world, the scientists could study them both to their heart\'s desire, and Shizuki Sayaka could ensnare her more deeply into her clutches. Everyone would win, with the possible exception of Kuroi Kana.

Asami had been astonished when Ryouko didn\'t accept the offer on the spot. Instead, she had spent a few days ruminating on it, talking to both her parents, and both Mami and Kyouko. They all said it sounded perfectly reasonable.

So she agreed. What else could she do? It was too logical, and the only obvious route by which Asami could be pulled away from the combat assignment she had grown to detest.

It still felt odd.

She consented to Asami\'s cuddling for a moment, curling their hair together in the apparently common fashion as they continued to walk. She felt conspicuous entangled like that in the mansion\'s atrium, and just to be contrary, she muttered:

\"I feel like a damn stick of celery.\"

Her dress, one of those scrupulously formal ballroom dresses that would apparently never go out of style, was a somewhat dark shade of green, with ruffles at the bottom that flared outward. On her body, the strapless dress clung on more by friction than anything her chest could provide, and it was Clarisse that had made the vegetable quip, as she had examined herself in the virtual mirror. She just couldn\'t shake the mental image now---she looked like an unusually dark stick of *Apium graveolens*.

*I regret making that comment,* Clarisse thought.

\"Oh, don\'t say that, Ryouko,\" her mother said, appearing next to her in a black dress. \"You look beautiful, and you need to get used to wearing this kind of thing, for these kinds of social events.\"

\"I\'m pretty sure it\'s your job to say that,\" Ryouko said.

Clarisse sighed, in that deliberately loud tone that she had been hearing far too often lately.

*Ryouko, Asami picked that dress for you. You* asked *her to. You can\'t say it makes you look like* celery. *Think about it. I\'m an idiot for even bringing that up. It was a joke anyway. My aesthetic value algorithms say you look great. I\'m not making that up.*

Ryouko did think about it, for half a second, then cringed.

\"Shit, I didn\'t mean that,\" she said, stopping and turning to face the other girl. \"I was just saying something grumpy, just because.\"

Asami, who had been walking quietly, stopped, her own dark purple dress swirling around her feet. She shook her head slightly, turning to look at Ryouko.

\"It\'s no problem,\" she said, smiling slightly. \"I\'m used to that by now. Besides, Clarisse sent me a two thousand word essay last week about you. I read it. I\'m okay with it. Anyway, the dress matches your soul gem.\"

The girl grabbed Ryouko\'s hand, the one with the virtual soul gem, and raised it for a moment. Then she pulled Ryouko forward, into the building, so they would stop clogging the atrium.

*You sent her an* essay*?* Ryouko asked incredulously.

*And a video,* Clarisse thought. *Let\'s not talk about this right now.*

They breezed down the hallway, passing a few clusters of guests lingering outside the ballroom, drinks in hand.

On the way, they were stopped by an unfamiliar magical girl, decked out almost entirely in green, as Ryouko was. Ryouko waited a moment for her nomenclator to process, and only then did she notice the girl\'s conspicuous eyeball tattoo, the kind of tattoo no human would have.

*An AI?* she thought, as her nomenclator obligingly spit out:

###### \"*MG*\" 

-   **Age: Occupation:** *Governance: Magical Girls---Advisory AI Special Comments: Governance: Magical Girls proper is Chitose Yuma.*

\"Oh, it\'s the girl of the hour!\" MG said, putting a hand to her mouth to cover a gape. \"I\'m charmed to meet you.\"

The AI curtsied elaborately, drawing her broad‐based dress outward. To Ryouko, the AI looked eerily like Kyouko, but different somehow. She couldn\'t decide how. It was enough to confuse her briefly.

Ryouko blinked, trying to decide quickly what to say.

\"I don\'t think I\'m the girl of the hour,\" she said. \"That would be, uh, Chitose‐san, I\'d imagine.\"

\"I suppose,\" MG said genially. \"Nice dress, by the way. Us green girls have got to stick together.\"

\"Oh, uh, sure,\" Ryouko responded awkwardly, as the AI left to greet other guests.

\"See, *she* likes it,\" Asami said under her breath, as they stepped through a set of wooden double doors.

\"I told you I was sorry,\" Ryouko replied---before stopping cold.

Weeks of living on Eurydome had gotten Ryouko a bit more acclimated to large, open buildings, but she still had to stop and gape at the ballroom. Corinthian columns, giant chandeliers, and two‐story picture windows framed a gleaming white marble floor, all enormous in scale. The columns and floor were inlaid with what appeared to be elaborate veins of emerald and jade, winding their way along the polished surface. At the edges, recessed alcoves led into private niches and exitways, suggesting no end of places to explore and hide.

Even with its size, the ballroom was plenty dense with people. A motley assortment of teenagers and adults socializing, eating, and dancing. It came as no surprise to her that the teenagers were all girls, and that the population of the room as a whole skewed heavily female. She wondered how old all of them really were.

*Once, long ago, these kind of parties were all some magical girls ever did,* Clarisse said. *A shame, really.*

*What?* Ryouko thought.

Nakase grabbed their shoulders, shooing them away from the entranceway, towards a jade‐and‐gold table full of food hidden in one of the side‐alcoves.

\"Well, what are we supposed to do now?\" Asami asked, looking just as lost as Ryouko felt.

\"Eat, socialize,\" Nakase said. \"Or, actually, why don\'t you try dancing?\"

Ryouko glanced at her mother, who looked oddly gleeful, then at the dance floor, which was full of couples swaying back and forth to a familiar‐sounding piece of old music. She felt skeptical.

\"I don\'t even know how to dance,\" she said, making sure her skepticism showed on her face.

\"I\'m sure your TacComp can provide something useful. In my day, we danced first and slept later.\"

\"What?\" Asami asked.

\"You\'re not *that* old,\" Ryouko echoed.

\"Nothing,\" Nakase said. \"Go. Dance. Walking around slowly also counts. That\'s an order.\"

She gave Ryouko a small shove, urging her forward. Ryouko started to look back, uncertainly, then sighed, turning back towards the ballroom floor. If she was going to be dragooned into doing this, she might as well make the most of it. Her mother was right. Yuma\'s birthday party was set in a ballroom. Dancing was what was supposed to happen.

She grabbed Asami, who really *had* turned back, and pulled her forward, spinning the girl around so that they faced each other. Asami looked back at her, eyes wide, and Ryouko felt a small spike of affection.

It was true, what Clarisse van Rossum had said. It was possible for love to grow into you. She could definitely see that now. As for whether it could be called love yet...

She let her TacComp guide her through the motions of a formal dance, old‐fashioned, dating back to the twenty‐second century *at least.* She put one hand on Asami\'s waist, but a moment later Asami put her head on her shoulder, so that they ended up doing more of a swaying walk than an actual dance.

Well, that worked too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When they finally retreated from the dance floor, they found Ryouko\'s mother seated in one of the small alcoves with a few small plates of hors d\'oeuvres. Improbably, she had found someone to talk with. Even more improbably, that someone was Kyouko, who was in fine form, wearing a sparkling---and revealing---red dress, with high heels that looked like they could kill.

\"I actually wrote a book on the subject, back in the day,\" Kyouko said, as they approached. \"It\'s a little embarrassing, but I can send you a copy. Though it sounds like they have things under control.\"

\"It was pretty loud,\" Nakase said. \"Which is funny, because---oh, but here she is! I saved you some food, Ryouko.\"

Ryouko glanced at her mother, taking the proffered plate. She suspected she knew what the conversation had been about, but said nothing. Suffice to say, agreeing to let her mother stay in her room, while she moved temporarily into Asami\'s room, had resulted in a bit of a cascading effect.

*I totally warned you about that,* Clarisse commented. *You should have taken the couch.*

*Says the Tactical Computer that didn\'t say a damn thing when she opened the door and looked in,* Ryouko complained, for what must have been the twentieth time.

*It was already too late. Saying something would have just made it worse and interrupted the fun. It\'s not my fault you showed poor judgment.*

*I\'m not sure about the \'fun\', with someone like you looking over my shoulder and dispensing advice. Sometimes you should just let things happen.*

*And let you flounder? Face it, my advice helped. Besides, I literally can\'t* not *be involved. And, you know, I presume they give me manuals for a reason.*

*It just wasn\'t comfortable. It was awkward. I\'m not used to it.*

*It was awkward* anyway.

\"Ryouko!\" Asami said, nudging her in the side with an elbow, startling her out of her reverie.

\"Oh, yes, sorry,\" she said hastily. \"Good to see you again, Sakura‐san.\"

\"No need to be so formal,\" Kyouko said blandly, pausing to take a sip of her red wine. Ryouko had never seen her so decked out.

\"She\'s been doing that a lot nowadays,\" Asami said, by way of apology. \"I don\'t know what she\'s thinking about.\"

Had she? Ryouko supposed she had had much to think about.

\"I guess life has been treating you well, then?\" she asked rhetorically. \"Your mother has just been telling me how well the two of you have been doing. It\'s early days yet---*very* early---but that\'s good to hear.\"

Ryouko started to protest that the current arrangement was temporary, that she didn\'t know how long she was going to do this, and that she wasn\'t sure she wanted to stay away from the front permanently, but managed to stop herself. That discussion with Asami could come later.

Instead, Kyouko saw her hesitate, and chose to speak first.

\"Not to imply that you\'re destined to break up or anything, but take my advice. Treasure your first relationship. There\'ll never be another one quite like it.\"

The girl peered at Ryouko, with the kind of fierce gaze that seemed intended to will her into agreeing. When she finally nodded, Kyouko switched her gaze to Asami, who nodded with almost unseemly haste. The intensity surprised Ryouko, who hadn\'t expected Kyouko to *care* quite so much.

\"Well, anyway,\" Kyouko said finally. \"I feel I am obligated to ask. Have you had any other visions lately, Ryouko? It\'s rare that we have anyone have any away from the Ribbon, so I thought I\'d check.\"

Ryouko had learned over the past month to expect this kind of question, whenever she and Kyouko communicated. It was usually easily parried by a simple \"no\", but now she shared an uneasy glance with Asami.

Then she looked at her mother, who was watching her with a serious expression. Doubtless, Kyouko had used the earlier conversation to feel her mother out on religious topics---and would have learned rather quickly that her mother had little tolerance for religious claptrap, despite the rumors that surrounded her daughter. Ryouko... had not yet tried to speak with her regarding the \"Goddess\". It had been easier not to.

Kyouko had outflanked her, she realized. It was already too late to fake a confused reaction, which would have been impossible to hold in the face of Kyouko\'s questioning anyway. She couldn\'t switch to transmission, either, since her mother---a scientist with much experience with the military, among other things---would immediately realize what she was up to.

She had learned to get used to being outflanked by Ancients in conversations. Their superior experience meant that they were capable of running circles around her, if they so chose. That didn\'t really make it less annoying, though.

\"No, I haven\'t, Kyouko,\" she said, trying to shrug nonchalantly.

Kyouko nodded, then turned to say something to Asami. Ryouko sighed in relief.

Perhaps, if her mother weren\'t here---if Asami weren\'t here---she would have been tempted to speak further. It would have been a terrible idea, saying it to Kyouko, given everything she had lied to her about, but she would have been tempted.

She wished, not for the first time, that she could meet Clarisse van Rossum again. Unlike either of her official mentors, she was someone she could feel safe asking advice from, but she was stubbornly never around.

Then, for the first time, it occurred to her that Clarisse might be at this very party.

*Oh, that\'s not a bad idea at all,* the other Clarisse, her TacComp, thought. *She\'s on the invitation list. You should find her later. Also, you have zoned out of the active conversation, once again.*

Her TacComp\'s prompt startled her out of her reverie once more, and the device even obligingly played back the past few moments for her.

\"I understand the reservations Ryouko has about affiliating herself with us, but we really are a very inclusive group,\" Kyouko was saying. "If you have any questions, even on her behalf, I\'ll be available. You can message me directly if you like.\"

\"O--okay,\" Asami said, wilting under Kyouko\'s gaze, and peering desperately at Ryouko for guidance.

Ryouko cringed internally. It had not been a good time to mentally check out of the conversation.

\"Maybe,\" she asserted, feeling her mother\'s eyes on her. \"It\'s not like I\'m stopping Asami from joining. Don\'t pressure her.\"

That was mostly true. After the \"relationship advice\" incident, Asami had been briefly interested in learning all she could about the Cult, and seemed puzzled that Ryouko wasn\'t a member. Ryouko\'s explanation had been simple: the Goddess was real, but she didn\'t think the Cult necessarily had any answers. Asami was free to look into it more if she wanted. Ryouko wasn\'t going to stop her from joining or anything like that.

That had satisfied Asami, who stopped looking into the Cult. She was fine, it seemed, with Ryouko\'s judgment substituting for her own on the matter. Privately, Ryouko was relieved, even if she felt a twinge of guilt about being manipulative. To her, it seemed possible Asami would have been happier as a member of the Cult. Certainly, knowing that they had an afterlife waiting for her had soothed Asami\'s psyche, even before Ryouko had used Shizuki Sayaka\'s proposal to pull her away from the front lines.

Kyouko shook her head slightly, smiling, seeming amused that Ryouko had stood up to her, just a little.

\"Nothing like that,\" she said. \"I\'m just letting her know her options. Seems fair enough. Incidentally, have you seen Mami? She\'s supposed to be at this shindig.\"

\"Not at all. I just got here,\" Ryouko said---but Kyouko was already ignoring her, striding past her and peering across the room.

\"Ah, I see her,\" Kyouko said. \"Thanks anyway. I\'ll send you two that book.\"

\"Book?\" Ryouko asked, too late.

For a moment, she watched Kyouko\'s back as she walked away---then received the mental ping indicating she had a new message. With a book as an attachment, apparently.

*She needn\'t have bothered,* Clarisse thought sardonically. *That book of tips she wrote is actually one of the manuals I came preloaded with. This is all rather amusing, actually.*

*Tips?* Ryouko thought, flipping the virtual book to a random page.

Her eyebrows shot upward, and she wasn\'t able to suppress a blush as she did the mental equivalent of slamming the book shut. Asami might have finally gotten over being in a new body, but Ryouko didn\'t think they were ready for *that* yet.

Then she looked at Asami, who was staring off into space with a vacant expression, but blushing furiously.

Ryouko reached over and grabbed the girl by the shoulder, shaking vigorously. Looking at her mother, she could see the woman smiling, laughing silently at them.

She knew it wouldn\'t last, though, and once Asami blinked herself back awake the woman\'s expression turned immediately serious, as easily as flipping a switch.

\"Ryouko,\" she said, her voice carrying an undertone of warning. \"What was all this talk about visions just now?\"

Ryouko shifted a little, wondering if she could get out of the discussion. Asami watched her to see what she would say, but didn\'t seem to realize that she should contrive a distraction for Ryouko\'s mother.

Ryouko considered messaging her, or using telepathy---they were in the same VR facility, buried in the bowels of the university Ryouko was currently \"working\" at. She decided, though, she couldn\'t avoid the topic forever, and now was as good a time as any to get it out of the way.

She swallowed, as surreptitiously as she could.

\"I\'ve been keeping this a secret from the Cult,\" she said, \"because I don\'t know if I want to get mixed in with them, but I may have had a religious experience before I did the wormhole thing.\"

She tried to keep her tone business‐like throughout the statement.

Her mother tilted her head a little, looking shocked but not totally surprised.

\"A religious experience? What kind?\"

\"I might have spoken with this Goddess they believe in. She might have given me some instructions regarding the wormhole.\"

Her mother let out a breath, shaking her head slightly.

\"Just as the rumors said. Ryouko, you know my opinion of religious‐type things, and I\'m glad you don\'t see the need to join the Cult, but... well, in my line of work I\'ve met quite a few girls from the Cult. They\'ve always seemed quite sincere in their beliefs, but I\'ve never thought there was much to it. At best it was some kind of side effect of the magic, some kind of group telepathy, driven by emotional fervor. Are you sure it wasn\'t something like that?\"

Ryouko shifted where she stood, squirming slightly. She considered the possibility for a moment, but dismissed it almost immediately. It had all seemed too real, and there was also...

\"No, definitely not,\" she said.

She hesitated for a moment, again swallowing. Not even Asami had heard the other part of the story from her. Did she really want to tell it to her? After all, it could easily be considered a family matter.

She looked down and squirmed a bit more, this time deliberately, to conceal the message she was sending to her mother.

\"*It\'s not just that,*\" she transmitted. \"*I think we\'re related to her. Apparently she was the sister of one of your ancestors.*\"

Her mother, well used to the military\'s enhanced messaging privileges, concealed her reaction to the message well, only blinking once in surprise.

\"*I wouldn\'t have taken you for someone with a messiah complex,*\" she transmitted back, for once betraying deep skepticism. \"*Besides, I\'m not even sure that means anything. If you go far enough back in time, any given person is the ancestor of either everyone living, or nobody. Literally.*\"

Ryouko looked back up, suppressing a smile. Only her mother would think to insert a comment like that---and Ryouko herself, if Asami was to be believed.

\"Can we talk about this later, mama?\" she said out loud. \"I don\'t think this is the place.\"

She also needed time to consider what to say. Out of respect for her mother, she had considered it a necessary, inevitable conversation---but she hadn\'t planned what exactly to say.

She did, however, start forwarding the memory she had received from her grandmother, who had given her the right to share it, if she so chose.

\"Alright,\" her mother said, nodding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"What do you mean you haven\'t even visited her?\" Yuma demanded, voice as loud as she could discreetly make it.

\"I mean that I haven\'t visited her,\" Kyouko hissed back, hunching over so she could speak into the smaller girl\'s ear. \"I don\'t see why it\'s my responsibility to. We broke up. That means something, you know.\"

To the others in the room it looked like they were having an intimate, whispered conversation, seated in an isolated corner of the room. The birthday girl taking a break from the party to talk with one of her oldest friends. That was the impression they intended to give, of course. Setting up a formal privacy screen would have caused too much whispering.

\"You know how she feels about you. You\'re just going to leave her to rot?\"

\"You could\'ve brought this up about many of my previous relationships. Why now? What\'s special about her? Why do you suddenly care about these neophytes?\"

\"Two reasons, *nee‐chan,*\" she said, placing an angry inflection on the phrase. \"The first is that we\'re getting tired of cleaning up after you. It\'s a polite fiction you\'ve got going, pretending the girls you sleep with don\'t care when you toss them out like yesterday\'s garbage. For some of them it\'s even true. But not most of them. All those broken hearts you leave behind, and for what? So you can keep trying to fill the hole in your heart? I\'ve read the reports, nee‐chan. I know what the MHD thinks of you.\"

\"Reading confidential reports now, Yuma‐*chan?*\" Kyouko asked, glaring back at her, not acknowledging what she had said.

\"You know very well we all read each other\'s reports. We look out for each other. That\'s how it\'s always been.\"

Kyouko turned away, and spoke calmly.

\"I don\'t want to be lectured by the likes of you and Mami. A girl who playacts as a child and another too traumatized to make any new friends. We\'re all broken. You have no right.\"

\"I wasn\'t done talking, nee‐chan. I said there were two reasons.\"

Kyouko sat impassively, still turned away, refusing to acknowledge the comment.

\"Kishida Maki is special because she\'s special to *you.* It might have started for twisted reasons, but you started to care about her. It was obvious. We were getting hopeful. But that\'s why you had to end it, wasn\'t it?\"

A heartbeat of time passed, and then Kyouko said:

\"She\'s young. She\'ll get over it.\"

\"You were her first, nee‐chan. The first is special. You\'re the one who says that.\"

\"So I leave you two alone for fifteen minutes and this is what happens, huh?\" Mami said, suddenly looming over them. \"For four‐hundred‐year‐olds, you two sure aren\'t any good at hiding when you\'re having an argument.\"

\"Assuming you two old maids didn\'t plot it against me,\" Kyouko grumbled.

\"You keep calling me that,\" Yuma said. \"But you\'re just making baseless assumptions.\"

\"You keep claiming you\'re not, but you never present any evidence otherwise,\" Kyouko retorted.

\"Stop bickering, you two,\" Mami said, in her best \"Mami‐onee‐chan\" voice. \"Yuma‐chan, didn\'t you say you wanted to meet the \'Hero of Orpheus\' while she was at your party? Well, don\'t miss your chance; I\'ll introduce you.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko sensed Yuma coming before she saw her, the sea of guests shifting gradually before her. The ripples spread through the crowd, the background murmur of the crowd quieting, replaced by the greetings of well‐wishers. The wave approached only slowly, as Yuma was impeded by the crowd, obliged to respond attentively to everyone she passed, but Ryouko knew, somehow, where it was inexorably headed.

It occurred to her that she might be getting used to being a center of attention herself, the kind of person important individuals would seek out, trailing their shockwaves behind them. Kuroi Kana, Shizuki Sayaka, Atsuko Arisu---they had all sought her out already, stopping by to offer a few words of greeting. In Kana\'s case, Ryouko had found it difficult to read what the Matriarch really thought of Ryouko\'s new, Shizuki‐sponsored position.

\"I think Chitose‐san is approaching,\" Asami said, as Yuma grew closer, and Ryouko nodded absently, for once ahead of her partner.

She craned her head to look, and finally got a glimpse of the girl. Dressed in a simple green dress, her childish frame was difficult to spot even in a crowd saturated with relatively young magical girls. She was conspicuous only due to her magnetic effect on the people around her, further enhanced by the presence of Kyouko and Mami traveling with her, the latter\'s modest yellow dress serving as a contrast to the former.

Even in a virtual setting, the color‐coded trio formed a formidable---and rare---nexus of MSY power. They operated so smoothly that it was easy to forget for a moment the gaping hole in their circle of power, one that had once been occupied by a certain Akemi Homura.

Finally, Yuma turned away from the girl she was talking with---a certain Kugimiya Aiko, apparently---signaling with her body language that she was ready to move on. She stepped into the crowd, and for a moment their eyes met.

Ryouko knew, then, why MG had looked so oddly familiar to her. MG didn\'t just look like Kyouko; she also looked like *Yuma,* a fact which seemed obvious in retrospect.

More importantly, Yuma\'s virtual form was older in age than the child form she usually carried. This version of her appeared closer to eleven than eight; it reminded her unavoidably of a memory of hers, of the same girl crying on the ground in front of a corpse, calling herself a monster.

But before she could remember the details of the vision, or think through its implications once again, Yuma arrived, striding into the corner of the room where Asami, Ryouko, and her mother had placed themselves. The girl surprised her by stepping forward immediately, extending her hand in expectation of a handshake. Ryouko had been prepared for a round of Japanese‐style bowing, but recovered swiftly, taking the hand of the smaller girl.

\"Happy birthday,\" she said in Japanese, for once knowing exactly what to say first.

\"Thank you,\" the girl said in Standard, tilting her head in acknowledgment.

Ryouko stood there awkwardly for a moment, as the other girl watched her coolly. She knew she looked foolish, sweating nervously in front of a girl that looked four years younger than her, but she couldn\'t help it. She knew what was said about Chitose Yuma.

\"I\'ve heard about your exploits, of course,\" the girl said finally, bowing her head slightly. \"Congratulations on a mission well‐executed.\"

\"T--thank you.\"

The conversation stalled again, Yuma again watching her with that unnerving gaze. What was she trying to see? Did she know that Ryouko had seen her past? No---that was preposterous.

Finally, Yuma turned slightly, bowing in the direction of Ryouko\'s mother, who appeared surprised, having been expecting a handshake. They exchanged bows, and then Yuma said:

\"I appreciate the work done at both the Prometheus and Zeus Institutes by hard‐working scientists such as yourself. And of course, the work that goes into raising such a fine daughter.\"

Yuma smiled slightly at the end of the last sentence, lightening what had been a surprisingly stiff and formal exchange.

\"Thank you,\" Ryouko\'s mother said, exchanging with Yuma a look Ryouko couldn\'t interpret.

\"Child licenses are so hard to get nowadays, aren\'t they?\" Yuma said airily. \"Though I suppose it shouldn\'t have been too hard for someone of your pedigree.\"

Ryouko\'s mother blinked, hesitating for a moment.

\"Well, my family matriarch wasn\'t exactly pleased about my marriage. It didn\'t make it easy. I was able to talk them into it. Ryouko‐chan wouldn\'t be here without it.\"

She rubbed Ryouko\'s hair enthusiastically for a moment, causing Ryouko to flinch slightly, her hair tendrils flailing in protest.

\"Hmm, well, Kana‐chan can be strange sometimes,\" Yuma said.

They stood there a moment longer, Yuma seemingly content to simply stand quietly, before Mami cleared her throat slightly to get their attention. Ryouko had almost forgotten she and Kyouko were there.

\"Well, personally I\'m glad we were all able to get together like this,\" Mami said. \"Your daughter has a lot of potential, and Yuma‐chan was excited to meet her. Yuma‐chan is just bad at talking to people sometimes.\"

\"Nee‐chan! Don\'t embarrass me in front of the young ones!\"

Yuma pouted and looked... bashful? The expression seemed incongruous, the change from her previous expression being almost enough to give whiplash.

The girl held up her arms to be picked up, and Mami rolled her eyes, but picked her up anyway, holding her in the air for a moment before setting her back down.

\"Anyway, see you around,\" Yuma said, turning back towards Ryouko and waving, before turning to walk away.

Ryouko watched her as she left. Mami followed Yuma to the next set of guests, but Kyouko lingered, noticing Ryouko\'s look.

\"*You have something to ask, don\'t you?*\" Kyouko relayed to Ryouko. "*I can see you thinking about it. Well then, ask.*\"

Ryouko looked down. How on Earth had Kyouko known? Should she deny it?

\"*I\'ve seen Yuma before, in one of my visions,*\" she thought, weighing her words carefully. \"*She was crouching over a white magical girl who was dead. She---that girl---was Mikuni Oriko. I know the story. But... I don\'t know. I think the Goddess was trying to tell me something about Yuma. But I\'m not sure if I should say anything.*\"

Kyouko\'s ordinarily unflappable expression seemed to waver, just a little. Then she chuckled.

\"Oh, the ways of the Goddess are mysterious indeed,\" Kyouko said, out loud. \"She really seems to like you. You\'re destined for something. It\'s obvious.\"

With that parting shot, the girl turned on her heel and strode off. Ryouko sighed, then turned to look at her mother, who she expected to have questions about what she and Kyouko had been talking about.

Instead she found her mother looking off into space, clearly lost in thought.

\"Mama?\" she asked. \"Is everything alright?\"

\"Oh, yes,\" her mother said, blinking rapidly. \"Of course. Didn\'t you say you wanted to look for Clarisse van Rossum? I remember how you used to talk about her. How was it, meeting your childhood hero?\"

\"Oh, uh, interesting, I guess,\" Ryouko said, rubbing the back of her head.

\"That was an odd conversation,\" Asami commented. \"With Chitose---uh---sama, I mean.\"

\"Yeah, it was.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She left her mother and girlfriend behind to look for Clarisse, and found her conferring with Nadya Antipova in a corner, wine glasses in hand. Their faces looked grim, and Ryouko wondered if something was wrong.

Clarisse spotted her approach, though, and the two of them rapidly dismissed their serious expressions, greeting her as she arrived. Like Mami and the others, Clarisse and Nadya\'s dresses were color‐coded to match their soul gems. Ryouko wondered if it was some sort of MSY tradition. Didn\'t people get tired of wearing the same color all the time? She suddenly regretted listening to Asami and wearing green.

\"Here to ask me for advice?\" Clarisse asked, before Ryouko could even say anything.

\"Am I that obvious?\"

Clarisse shrugged, before smiling slightly.

\"You\'re welcome to, of course.\"

\"How come no one ever asks me for advice?\" Nadya complained. \"I\'m over two hundred years old! I\'m practically a fount of knowledge!\"

\"I\'m over half a millennium old. I\'m wiser than you. Shoo!\"

Clarisse made the corresponding gesture with her hand. Nadya left in a huff, making a show of being affronted.

\"She\'ll be fine,\" Clarisse said. \"She\'s just faking it. Now what\'s up?\"

Clarisse was back in her older body, at least virtually, and bent over slightly to observe her. Ryouko felt her mouth going dry. She had sought out this meeting, but it was still a challenge to say what she wanted to say.

She looked down, and found herself looking at Clarisse\'s cleavage. A memory returned to her, and she glanced away, blushing.

\"I\'m conflicted,\" she said, managing to blurt out the words. \"I don\'t know if I\'m happy.\"

It felt odd saying the words in Standard, since she had always thought them in Japanese, but it would have been strange to speak to Clarisse in her native tongue.

She glanced up, feeling herself blushing even more, and found Clarisse studying her, looking every bit like the wise Ancient she was.

\"Oh dear,\" she said. \"I think we better sit down for this. Come on.\"

Clarisse gestured at a nearby windowsill, and they shuffled over in their dresses to sit down. The virtual sunlight pouring in through the window looked beautiful, she thought.

Clarisse looked around, making sure no one was close enough to listen in, before swirling her wine glass and getting straight to the point.

\"What\'s wrong?\" she asked.

Ryouko swallowed. She didn\'t know why she was so nervous, suddenly.

\"I don\'t know what to say,\" she started, finally, avoiding eye contact. \"I feel like I\'m adrift. I don\'t know. After I made my contract, I lost control of my life. It was just so crazy and non‐stop, and I realize now that I was never really in control. It was the Goddess, I think. I felt a little jerked around, honestly. But now... well, I asked her when I got back what she wanted me to do now, and she said I should choose for myself, and it\'s stupid, but now...\"

She let her voice trail off, and she looked up at Clarisse, who had one eyebrow raised. She realized she was rambling, and tried to focus.

\"I don\'t know,\" she said finally. \"I feel like I *should* be happy, but I\'m not. I have a cushy life on an alien world, and even a loving girlfriend. Asami is in paradise. I can tell. But I\'m not. It feels like... it feels like my wish was never made. I don\'t think it was about Earth at all. I think it was about my life. I don\'t like living a normal life.\"

Ryouko searched Clarisse\'s face for a reaction, and found the woman\'s eyes closed in bemusement.

\"Ryouko, I don\'t actually know what your wish is, and I don\'t have telepathy over interstellar distances. It is difficult for me to properly evaluate your statements in light of that. To be frank, I\'m not even sure what you have been doing since the wormhole mission.\"

\"Oh,\" Ryouko said, embarrassed. \"Well, I, uh---\"

Clarisse bent over slightly, making direct eye contact with Ryouko.

\"It\'s okay. You don\'t have to tell me. I think I understand anyway.\"

The woman bent her head for a moment, as if considering something, and then the rest of the virtual world blurred, sealed behind a privacy screen.

\"You made your wish to get away from living a normal life,\" Clarisse said. \"Because you wanted an extraordinary one. But now circumstances have returned you to normality. You want to shake things up again, yet you are afraid of destroying your relationship with Asami. Is this a good description of your problem?\"

Ryouko felt her mouth drying out again, then nodded hastily. Clarisse had produced a better description of her situation than she would have.

Clarisse swirled her wine glass thoughtfully, eyes resting on the windowsill.

\"I suppose it depends on the nature of your current relationship. It is the nature of things that in a serious relationship both parties must often make sacrifices. It is rare that both parties have the same idea of paradise, but the sacrifices must be roughly equal, or else it engenders resentment.\"

Clarisse set the wine cup down, abandoning her drink for the moment.

\"But of course,\" she said, \"that is only true for a serious relationship. At your age, it is frankly doubtful that it really could be. You do not seem ready to settle down, so there is no reason to force yourself to. If it is merely a matter of companionship, that can be satisfied without most of the other accoutrements of a relationship. It is not widely known, but I have a few friends of my own I see from time to time. It may sound cynical to one as young as you, but it does not have to mean anything more than that. With the benefit of old age, it is possible to see some things in a clearer light.\"

Ryouko shifted uncomfortably. Clarisse\'s attachments were an occasional topic of discussion on the fan forums, but to hear her say something like that---

\"I don\'t think Asami wants something like that,\" she said, watching her feet on the floor. \"I can see it in her eyes. She wants everything. To be honest, I\'m not sure if I don\'t want everything. It\'s not just about the sex for me, I don\'t think. Honestly she\'s the one who really wants that.\"

Her eyes widened a moment later, and her hands shot to her mouth, appalled. Did she just say that? She had meant to say \"companionship\".

But when she looked at Clarisse, the woman seemed hardly fazed by her embarrassing comment.

\"I thought as much,\" Clarisse said, staring at the blurred‐out room in front of her. \"You\'re both young enough to crave romantic love. But you\'re a wanderer, and it makes things difficult, even in this day and age. But...\"

Clarisse cupped her head in one hand, tapping her fingers against her chin.

\"The memories I have taken from others imply that it is better to be truthful, and quickly,\" she said. \"It is not good to let these things fester. You are too young to settle down. Even she is, whatever she may think. Tell her now, and it may be possible to form a workable long‐term arrangement. If you wait until you get miserable, that will lead to yelling, and that typically does not end well.\"

Clarisse seemed to shrug slightly, then picked up her cup and finished her wine. Ryouko sensed the conversation was over, but felt she had to ask:

\"If it\'s not too much to ask, you mentioned you were in a few relationships. How serious were they? I know your life made it difficult, but...\"

She let her voice trail off, not meeting Clarisse\'s eyes. She wondered if it had been a bridge too far.

\"As a matter of fact,\" Clarisse said, voice airy. \"It got serious several times. To some point, at least, but not far enough to seriously contemplate marriage or children. It was always more for companionship. My lifestyle is too problematic for anything otherwise. But not all of us Ancients are as broken as your mentors. It is possible to reach my age with an intact heart.\"

Ryouko glanced at her, startled by the comment.

\"Mentors? You mean Kyouko and Mami?\"

Clarisse smiled and shrugged, then dissolved the privacy curtain, standing up.

\"Go back to your girlfriend,\" she said, bending over towards Ryouko. "I bet she\'s wondering what you\'re doing. You can contact me if you want more advice, okay? Just not of the sexual sort. That\'s better addressed towards Kyouko.\"

Clarisse chuckled slightly, taking the opportunity provided by Ryouko\'s embarrassed reaction to leave, abruptly and efficiently. Ryouko realized she had been outmaneuvered once again.

*I don\'t like these old people,* she thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

No birthday party, even an elaborate virtual ballroom gala, was complete without cake and presents, and it wasn\'t long before a suitably large and multi‐tiered cake was wheeled out onto the dance floor, next to a prodigious stack of virtual presents. Covered in a green‐tinted icing, it was exquisitely designed, brown and green vines of sugar frosting winding their way on, around, and seemingly into the cake, twisting their way up to the higher layers. White flowers dotted the vines, some fully bloomed, others half‐opened, still others tightly furled. Its ethereal design hinted at the uncanny, and despite its vibrancy, there remained the suggestion of age, of the kind that would befit Yggdrasil. At the very top, one great apical blossom opened to reveal not just a flower, but a soul gem, transparent sugar vibrant in the lighting.

Then Yuma cut into the bottom layer with a ceremonial knife, and Ryouko almost cringed. Even as a virtual design, it seemed a crime to disfigure.

\"Ooo,\" Asami vocalized next to her. \"Jasmine flowers, I think.\"

It tasted like jasmine, too, as Ryouko discovered when she was finally passed her slice, an amputated vine of brown sugar crawling over the top surface. Chocolate, jasmine, rosewater, and green tea, among other things, her enhanced sense of smell informed her. There were times when it came in handy.

Asami sighed, biting into a piece of her cake.

\"This is heavenly,\" she said. \"Even though I know it\'s virtual. I wonder if someone can actually make this.\"

Ryouko nodded silently, carefully cutting off a tiny piece with her silver fork. Honestly, she felt too distracted to eat.

\"I wonder how long it\'s going to take her to open all those presents,\" Asami said, staring at Yuma in the distance, who was already holding up some gifted trinket proudly.

\"She\'s only going to do some of them, chosen randomly,\" Ryouko commented emptily. \"It\'s on the program. There\'s also a full list of the presents that people are going to send her.\"

\"Oh, I see!\" Asami said cheerily.

Asami bit into a forkful of cake, then crinkled her brow, detecting the shift in Ryouko\'s tone. She peered at Ryouko from one eye.

Ryouko knew her body language was too revealing, and that she was even slumped slightly in her chair.

\"Is something wrong?\" Asami asked, the inevitable question finally arriving.

*I should say something,* Ryouko thought. *I have to.*

She stabbed her cake with her fork.

*But not now, obviously,* she thought. *This is clearly not a good time.*

*Just make sure you say something after the party,* her TacComp thought. If you wait too long, you\'ll lose impetus. And we both know how you love to procrastinate.*

*You\'re the light of my life, as always,* Ryouko thought, sarcastically.

\"Ryouko?\" Asami asked, again.

Ryouko couldn\'t say for certain what impulse drove her at that moment, but the next thing she knew, she had leaned forward and kissed Asami, full on the mouth, eyes closed. Asami was wide‐eyed, and her hands shook slightly, before she dropped her cake entirely---but, of course, the cake and plate vanished before hitting the floor, reappearing in her hand a moment later.

Then Ryouko\'s mind caught up with her, and she snapped back, wondering what had gotten into her. Now blushing fiercely, she looked around for her biggest potential source of embarrassment.

But Kuroi Nakase was not there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko\'s mother found Chitose Yuma standing alone on a private balcony, hidden on the ordinarily inaccessible second floor of the partially virtual manor. From here, the view overlooked a vibrant forest landscape, complete with circling birds and distant mountains. One part of the view was flat, though, and there the sun was setting, casting the sky into a brilliant array of red and orange.

She did not question how it was that Yuma could be here, on the balcony, and also downstairs opening presents with all the glee of an actual eleven‐year‐old. She had met enough Governance Representatives in her life to know that this was how they operated.

\"You wanted to meet?\" she asked, leaning onto the balcony.

Yuma gestured at her to walk forward to the balcony, and she did so, a little hesitantly. Whatever it was *Governance: Magical Girls* wanted, she doubted she would like it.

The girl smiled up at her disarmingly, the childish effect ruined somewhat by the glass of red wine the girl was swirling playfully.

\"I just wanted to have a bit of a frank discussion,\" she said, in axiomatic, if old‐style, Japanese. \"There\'s nothing to worry about.\"

Nakase nodded, even though she doubted the veracity of that statement.

\"About Ryouko, I imagine?\"

\"Don\'t you feel it\'s a little odd for her to get so... committed, this early?\" Yuma asked. \"With Nakihara‐san, I mean. They\'re hardly old or experienced. I wouldn\'t have expected you to go along with it so readily. At their age, I was still the baby of my group. I was coddled.\"

Nakase blinked, pulling away from the balcony a little. This was not the type of conversation she had been expecting.

\"I\'m worried, of course,\" she said, a moment later. \"Not at the relationship per se, but at the consequences of a break‐up. On the balance, though, it\'s probably better this way, especially after I divorced her father. She\'s very independent, but with her lifestyle, she could easily get lonely. I remember when I was contracted---I could have used someone to lean on. Er, well, you do know about that, right?\"

Yuma smiled slightly.

\"Of course,\" she said, looking back out the landscape. \"I\'m sure that doesn\'t surprise you.\"

The girl leaned over the balcony a little, peering down below, and Nakase had to suppress the urge to pull her back.

\"Well,\" Yuma said, leaning on the balcony normally again, \"that\'s more or less the reasoning I expected. I was just curious. Of course, I called you here to talk about something more serious than that.\"

Nakase saw the girl hesitate a little, almost imperceptibly, and knew her original intimation about this conversation---that she would not like it---was about to come true.

\"Well, I\'ll cut to the chase,\" Yuma said, turning to look up into her eyes. \"You are doubtless aware that your daughter possesses a rather unusual genetic makeup. Six standard deviations away from the human mean, among other things.\"

Of course Nakase was aware. Among other things, they would have told her when Ryouko was born, as something to keep in mind. It would, however, have been relatively proprietary information until she was inducted into the military, where they had re‐sequenced her as a matter of caution. Her ex‐husband had told her himself that her genome was substantively unchanged from what it had been at birth, as expected.

\"Yes, of course,\" she said. \"We never told her, since we never saw any reason to.\"

\"Are you aware of the exact distribution of her rare alleles?\" Yuma asked, peering directly into her pupils, such that she felt pinned by the gaze, unable to flinch. There was a reason Nakase did *not* like dealing with women of Yuma\'s age.

\"Though this is considered secret information, the MSY keeps a record of the genetic information of its members,\" Yuma continued, when Nakase did not respond. \"We know, statistically, which gene variants are associated with being one of our members, and which are not. Your daughter has gene variants primarily of the former.\"

\"We knew that,\" Nakase said, mouth dry. \"We had the clearance, and we were of course curious ourselves. It\'s not terribly surprising, given the backgrounds of her father and I. I myself am highly enriched in such variants.\"

Though she felt intimidated, she refused to beat around the bush. Better to say everything Yuma assuredly already knew up‐front, to save them both time.

\"Yes,\" Yuma said, in a continuingly unnerving tone, \"but you are not as enriched as your daughter. Unlike most of the other Matriarchies, the Shizuki and Kuroi lines have been segregated for centuries, and any gene exchange that might have occurred has taken place only indirectly. As a consequence the Shizuki and Kuroi lines have fairly distinct MG predisposing alleles.\"

\"Yes,\" Nakase said, nodding carefully, \"and it is a matter of regret to the MSY that the two lines have not yet reconciled, since it deprives the organization of many potentially powerful recruits. I\'m sure you know that my ex‐husband and I probably know more on the matter than almost anyone alive.\"

Yuma smiled thinly.

\"Then I am sure that you are aware that it\'s not just a matter of Shizuki and Kuroi. Both the Kugimiya and Kaname lines have produced powerful contractees in their own right, counting among their members powerful mages from diverse locales. But, not having formed Matriarchies, they have not experienced much gene flow from the traditional sources. In short, they are an untapped source of genetic variation, and it is serendipitous that all four lines would come together like this.\"

Nakase frowned slightly. She did not, in fact, know everything that Yuma was saying. What had this girl been doing, digging into her family records?

\"Why are you telling me about my own ancestry?\" she asked, making sure to sound fairly annoyed.

\"I am merely commenting on the circumstances that led to your daughter being perhaps one of the most genetically unusual girls born in generations. Even beyond just mere family genetics, your daughter is also the carrier of a surprising number of meaningful *de novo mutations, especially related to CNS organization. Preliminary analyses carried out by our internal genetics teams suggest that the effects of these should be similar to many of the genetic variants she already carries.\"

Yuma had started to pace the floor, in the manner of a detective explaining her deductions, but paused to peer at Nakase, who seethed quietly. She did not like being lectured in this way---and she had not known the implications of her daughter\'s mutations, because they had never figured out a way to carry out the necessary AI modeling undetected. At the moment, she almost regretted being a scientist, because it meant this child‐like Ancient could say whatever she liked, without Nakase being able to feign ignorance.

Yuma resumed her pacing, walking in a hunched fashion that only made her even shorter.

\"I must confess that due to the sensitive nature of genetic therapies, we overlooked Ryouko‐chan, having failed to collect genetic information at birth, as is typical. Were the details of her genealogy widely known, the attempts by the various Matriarchies to integrate her into their lines would become a downright frenzy. The statistical models suggest that she is the closest thing to a sure contract as exists in this world. But you knew that, didn\'t you? Did you really think you could stop her from contracting?\"

\"What is your point?\" Nakase sneered, dropping her veneer of civility. "Are you here to lecture me about my patriotic duty?\"

Yuma stopped in front of Nakase, and this time stood up straight, looking Nakase as squarely as she could.

\"No,\" she said, bowing her head slightly, \"and I am sorry to have said things that upset you. I am here to tell you about your daughter.\"

She paused again, to make sure Nakase was listening, before continuing:

\"One of our scientists, having spotted some inconsistencies in your daughter\'s sequence reads, was able to convince your daughter to submit to a nanite‐mediated genetic survey. You know what chimerism is, don\'t you?\"

The question, coming as randomly as it did, confused her---and then she felt her jaw drop open slightly, hanging stupidly in the air.

\"You mean in the multi‐embryo sense, right? Not the animal‐human sense?\"

\"The scientific sense, yes, of course,\" Yuma agreed. \"The results of the genetic survey were *very* interesting. It seems your daughter is a genetic chimera. It used to be that human chimeras were relatively common, but after the advent of nanite‐guided embryonic development, it stopped really occurring. Among other things, that is why it is considered safe to assemble Tactical Computer implants based only on sequencing external DNA.\"

By now, Nakase had well and truly lost her cool. She could even feel herself shaking, a little. No, she had not known about this, and it scared her.

Yuma waited a moment for her to nod, then continued:

\"There are several interesting points about your daughter\'s chimerism. There are only two genomes involved, the primary, which is detectable from the outside, and the secondary, which is not. The secondary genome has an extremely restricted---but important---distribution. In fact, it seems to only be expressed within certain structures of the brain, and nowhere else. This secondary genome is, to put it mildly, extremely unusual. This is not a matter of just six standard deviations---this is a matter of *hundreds.* To put it bluntly, Kuroi‐san, this is the product of extensive and concentrated genetic engineering, the likes of which I have not seen since the days of the Unification Wars, and all carefully placed so as to be invisible from the outside. There are entire genes---gene networks, even---which we have never seen before. It will take us months to even begin to understand what is being done here.\"

Nakase felt sick, shaky on her feet. When Yuma stopped talking, she reached with one hand for the balcony railing, and found instead that she was looking up at the sky---Yuma had caught her as she fell, setting her slowly down to the floor.

She looked up into the girl\'s eyes.

\"I\'m sorry I had to do that to you,\" Yuma said, surprisingly gently. "But it was necessary to test you. You had no idea, did you?\"

The Ancient\'s voice was soothing, and Nakase let it lull her, instilling in her a sense of calm.

\"Of course not,\" she said, quietly. \"You think I would consent to have that done to my own daughter? By---the---I can\'t---\"

\"What *did* you consent to?\"

Nakase put a hand to her head, which hurt suddenly.

\"We were having trouble getting a birth license. There was an offer. I read the protocol---it looked okay---Kuma wanted---I wanted---\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The voice that trickled into Yuma\'s mind, loud and invasive, was set to maximum priority, and almost startled her into dropping the woman. Downstairs in the mansion, she tripped while walking towards the table with the presents, catching herself just in time. In several virtual Governance conference rooms, she paused mid‐sentence, causing quizzical looks from the other Representatives.

〈**Priority 1:** \"*Chitose, you must stop the questioning immediately.*\"〉

It was the Black Heart telepath she had on site on the planet of Eurydome, probing Kuroi Nakase\'s mind from a discreet distance.

\"*What? Why?*\" she transmitted back, fearing she already knew the answer.

\"*Her memories have been severely tampered with. Possibly a self‐erasure mechanism. You must stop pushing. We\'re going to have to try something else.*\"

Yuma looked down at the woman whose head she now cradled in her lap. Her eyes were now half‐closed, and she seemed to be staring at her fingers. Kuroi Nakase had once been a magical girl, but she wasn\'t anymore---and an ordinary human\'s brain could be manipulated far more easily, without an external soul gem to serve as a ward.

*I\'m sorry,* she thought. *We didn\'t think---*

\"*Will she be alright?*\" she asked the distant telepath, the signal piercing the depths of space at maximum priority, with the best quantum encryption available.

\"*I believe so,*\" the telepath transmitted. \"*It doesn\'t seem there\'s anything seriously malicious going on. But I\'m going to have to move in and doublecheck her condition personally, make sure everything is alright. Contingency plan C7, probably.*\"

Yuma let out a breath.

\"*I agree,*\" she thought.

A moment later, the woman on her lap vanished, ejected from the simulation. She would be alright after all. Yuma had feared otherwise. Despite what some people thought of her, she did still have a conscience.

She stood up, brushing off the front of her dress, and picked her half‐filled wine glass from the balcony. In the distance, the sun was almost finished setting.

Downstairs, another version of Yuma clanged a wine glass with a spoon, very publicly summoning the Hero of Orpheus to the front of the room to be praised, lauded, and otherwise embarrassed by the birthday girl. More importantly, Ryouko would be distracted from looking for her mother, or from leaving the party early.

Yuma held the wine glass over the edge of the railing, and overturned it, allowing the liquid within to spill over the edge of the railing, down to the garden below, with its elegant gazebo and round table, perfect for tea and cakes.

Yuma had lived her whole life in a bed of secrets and lies, but she vastly preferred the secrets and lies she slept with to be the ones she had engineered herself.

## Causality 

> The Trusted Computing Framework (TCF) was an initiative launched by Vladimir Volokhov and other prominent academics in the fall of 2145. In the wake of several high‐profile incidents involving poorly‐programmed AIs, and Volokhov's own revolutionary advances in the design of Volokhov‐friendly AIs, the TCF proposed to essentially eliminate the possibility of future disasters due to unforeseen programming errors, including those that resulted in accidentally unfriendly AIs.
>
> Previous investigative work by Volokhov had already proved the existence of a programming framework that would limit the output error of a designed computational system (under a predefined Volokhov‐Friendly criterion) to arbitrarily low values. Such a framework had been considered unfeasible for practical use, however, because it was also known that the derivation of the details of such a framework was incredibly difficult, and because human programmers could not be relied upon to implement such a complex computational architecture without introducing uncontrollable human error.
>
> Theoretically, the idea proposed by the TCF founding group was simple: With the assistance of already created Volokhov‐friendly AIs, the framework would first be derived and rigorously cross‐checked. Then, the framework would be used on the designing AIs themselves, eliminating any second order flaws---AI design flaws that coincidentally prevented the AI itself from noticing the problem. The AI would then examine the framework, the framework would be reapplied again, and the process would continue iteratively, provably converging on a stable framework, once the human input to the process had been removed.

> The aspect of the TCF that attracted the ire of critics was what Volokhov and his colleagues proposed to *do* with their framework. They proposed to design and distribute a second generation of specialized AI‐designing AIs, who would then go on to design further AIs, and so on, in an escalating process. Eventually, the intention was, these AIs would replace computer programmers in the fine design of all manner of software, from the controllers of automated vehicles, to the integrity of nuclear launch protocols, to the design of the AIs themselves. The error‐free nature of these descendant programs would be ensured by the inductively guaranteed error‐free nature of their ancestors, resting ultimately on the original work done by Volokhov, et al., which they promised would be rigorous, careful, and transparent, taking input from the entire computer science community.
>
> The potential value of a provably error‐free computing architecture was enormous, but so too were the possible negative ramifications, critics charged. Academically, concerns were raised about the integrity of the startup process, about the ethical ramifications of creating so many AIs, and about the economic implications of putting even *more* humans out of work. Meanwhile, the echo of generations of movies about violent AIs conquering the world continued to resonate in popular culture.
>
> All of this would be moot, however, if the political problems were not solved. The TCF was a grand idea, but the societies of the world, where AIs were still a rare novelty, were reluctant to turn over so much economic activity to inhuman AIs, based on an academic initiative spearheaded by a Russian---a national of a country who was not trusted by other governments. Skepticism, too, was an issue, and comments about the "Academician's pipedream" were common.
>
> Yet despite all of this, when the initial process was finally complete, Volokhov and the rest of the founding committee emerging from a special Swiss lab in triumph in 2148, the rate of adoption was breathtaking. Everyone, it seemed, had terrible intractable computing errors they wanted solved. Automobile manufacturers wanted to finally fix their notoriously hackable automated car software packages. Power management officials wanted to finally reign in the cascading failures that had caused several high‐profile blackouts. Government officials were tired of losing their incriminating and embarrassing messages to hackers. The stocks of high‐profile computer security corporations crashed in 2148, a portent of things to come.
>
> Many of the concerns expressed about the TCF proved well‐founded. The computing revolution in economic activity, already well in progress, abruptly surged forward, in a world whose societies were utterly unprepared for the transition. The Unification Wars were only a decade away, their arrival greatly hastened by the advances of Vladimir Volokhov, who for his part died to an assassin's bullet in 2165.
>
> And yet, such was the impact of his work that when the armies of the world finally took to the battlefield, they did so with equipment designed and manufactured by TCF algorithms and AIs, fighting side‐by‐side with TCF drones, under a command structure increasingly dependent on the advice of AIs. With the exception of the Freedom Alliance's foray into non‐Volokhov AIs---designed to serve their FA masters---essentially every piece of software and AI designed since still resides within the TCF, including the AIs of Governance. Since then, the framework has been modified and expanded by the AIs who are now its guardians, providing member AIs with powerful, desirable guarantees: free will, control over their own memory, reliable backup, and so forth.
>
> The theoretical integrity of the system still relies on the work of Volokhov so many years ago, but centuries of use have failed to reveal any major, or even minor, flaws. Many of the original AIs who participated in the process are still with us today, though often in radically different, upgraded forms, most preferring to keep a low profile. Most are somewhere in Governance---among the most notable are the Machine for the Allocation of Representation (MAR), and the Production and Allocation Machine (PAL).

> In addition to the common method of power development, which involves focused, deliberate work or training, and the natural development of skills in the course of standard learning, there is a much less well‐known phenomenon that occurs in Ancients. It seems that, for us Methuselah, it is very common to discover new magic powers in unexpected places, often completely unrelated to our main power. Usually, it creeps up on you---the fire mage whose colleagues point out that her movements are starting to look a lot like teleportation, the healer discovering that she's starting to eavesdrop on people's thoughts---in fact, mind‐reading is probably the single most common new skill.
>
> A few theories have been mooted about the Ancient community regarding the matter, but none is particularly convincing. What seems most likely is that this kind of "Ancient Power" is somehow a response to a persistent need---a magical girl who constantly needs to move quickly develops teleportation, for instance. The sheer frequency of mind‐reading is likely due to the constant use of telepathy in the MSY---and the constant need to know what others are thinking in meetings. Likewise, another common power is the manipulation of electronics. Perhaps it is the magic responding to the needs of the user, or the magical girl somehow pushing against the boundaries of whatever limits her power.
>
> It has been something to think about in my much extended old age. One thing seems clear to me: we have only seen the beginning of the phenomenon, because I am the oldest magical girl alive, and I am not even 600. What happens when a magical girl hits 1000? 2000? 10000?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I am sorry about your daughter, François‐san," Mami said.

The girl glanced up in surprise, eyes widening slightly, framed by her shoulder‐length, brown hair. She looked small somehow, holding her tiny cup of tea in both hands, seated cross‐legged under the glass table of Mami's living room.

Mami had a brief flashback, remembering another small‐looking magical girl, perplexed by the warmth of Mami's ship quarters, and cowed by the presence of the Field Marshal.

That girl was elsewhere now, taking a well‐deserved break after her feat at Orpheus. The girl in front of her, her intelligence officer Marianne François, was well over two hundred years, had seen Mami's shipboard quarters hundreds of times, and should have been used to it by now.

But she still looked small.

In retrospect, the resemblance between Marianne and her daughter Juliet was obvious, though with matriarchies one could assume very little. Similar‐looking cousins with similar‐looking faces occupying the same social circles weren't even a rare phenomenon, to the point where there were even a few comedies centered around the idea.

"I would have said something earlier had I known about her," Mami continued, seeing the pain that suddenly appeared in the girl's eyes. Juliet had been her only child, Mami knew now, having looked into the topic. The relationship that had birthed the child had fallen apart, husband and wife separating. Marianne had married late---very late---and it had broken her heart to break up.

Mami frowned, shaking her head slightly. Where had she read that last part?

*Poor girl,* she thought, a moment later.

Mami took a moment to watch the other girl, wondering whether to switch into French or another language Marianne was perhaps more comfortable in. They typically used Japanese, but there wasn't an actual reason to do so---French was one of the few languages Mami was legitimately fluent in, having picked it up slowly over the course of centuries. It was simply habit, she supposed.

Just as she had been about to say something else, Marianne raised her head, shaking it slightly.

"She knew what she was doing," she said in idiomatic Parisian French. "I'm glad she was at least able to die doing something of spectacular importance."

The statement sounded rehearsed, but Mami allowed herself to nod. There was no need to press the point.

"I thought about attending her funeral, François," she said, barely biting back an automatic "‐san", "but I was too busy. I apologize."

Mother and daughter had been alienated, but that hadn't stopped Marianne from throwing an extravagant spectacle of a funeral, as if the mother had been trying to fill the hole in her heart with flowers and speeches, making up for what she hadn't been able to do in life.

Mami shifted slightly, drumming her fingers on the table a little nervously. She had realized, suddenly, that she was once again accidentally picking up thoughts from the other girl. Centuries of diplomatic work had given her a slight ability to peer into the thoughts of others---a power she would certainly never have cultivated deliberately. It was a known phenomenon---given very long periods of time, magical girls tended to acquire skills related to their work, as if by osmosis.

Mami's mind‐reading was weak, and only worked on those not on their guard---such as Marianne at that moment. However, since she had never told anyone she had it, it was rare for anyone to be on their guard around her, and when she was making a serious attempt at reading someone's mood, it wasn't uncommon for her to accidentally catch the outer glimmers of someone's thoughts. She did not like it, particularly when it was depressing, as it was now.

This was different, though. She hadn't been trying to read Marianne---it was almost as if the magic had fired on its own.

She shook her head slightly. Clearly, she would just have to be more careful.

In truth, she could have gone to the funeral, if she had really wanted to, but coming so soon after all those others---she hadn't wanted to.

"It is alright," Marianne said, smiling slightly. "Thanks for the thought."

*It's not alright.*

The thought came through so strongly that Mami started, certain for a moment that Marianne had relayed the thought by telepathy. It was only then that she realized that she was still picking up the girl's thoughts, even more clearly now, despite her attempts to shut down her mind‐reading.

There was no time to be perplexed, however. Marianne had been seriously hurt at Mami's failure to attend. The girl had thought they were friends, but Mami never acted like it, and she wondered---

Mami shook her head again, clamping down on the mind‐reading full‐force. She did *not* need this right now, and she did not understand why her power control was going awry.

But was it true? Had she never noticed---

"Let's get on with business," Marianne said, stiffening her back, tone terse.

Mami nodded hastily, wondering if Marianne was picking up on her odd body language.

If Marianne had realized something was wrong, she wasn't showing any sign of it, clearing her throat before activating the holographic interface built into Mami's table. Documents, images, and charts appeared in midair before the two of them.

Mami had known Marianne to be almost absurdly paranoid with security sometimes, but they rarely bothered in Mami's shipboard quarters, secured by Marianne's own security team and monitored by *HSS Zhukov himself. If they couldn't feel secure here---if Mami couldn't trust Zhukov, who she now viewed as an old friend---then she had bigger problems than just information security.

"At your request, and strictly off the record, my agents and I have probed and audited, as you said, the *entire* grief cube logistics chain, including the military records you have provided me with. In the course of our investigation we have found two thousand, four hundred, and sixty‐three formal irregularities with grief cube accounting. Of these, essentially all disappear on closer inspection, or represent at most minor inaccuracies, owing to alleged human error. There is still a substantial net loss of grief cubes somewhere in the system, however."

Relevant charts and graphs passed in front of Mami, who glanced at them---long enough for Machina to grab a screenshot, just in case---but mostly just nodded sagely. It was better for everyone if she didn't question or learn about the details of Marianne's methods.

"As you well know," Marianne continued, "the Black Heart obtains a substantial number of its grief cubes via this supposed human error. Comparison with Black Heart records---which were *not* easy to get, let me tell you---reveals that black operations and operatives account for a substantial amount of the missing grief cubes. The remaining missing grief cubes are likely legitimate human error; those grief cubes probably never existed to start with."

"That's it, then?" Mami asked, feeling oddly relieved. "Everything vanishes on detailed inspection?"

That certainly *wasn't* what Kyouko's Cult‐led study had concluded. Perhaps they simply hadn't examined black operations, or something.

"No," Marianne said, shaking her head. "That is only if one focuses on discrepancies relating directly to the net quantity of cubes. Based on what you told me, we took care to focus on the details of distribution of grief cubes to combat units. There is a substantial number of incidents where the listed records of grief cube allocation do not match information downloaded from frontline units at the time. Specifically, these units record a single substantial fluctuation in drone‐delivered supply---a sudden severe shortage, followed by a later surplus making up the difference---that simply does not exist in the upstream records, which show a steady flow of grief cubes. Fluctuations occur during war, of course, but grief cube supply is one of the most important functions the logistics chain provides, and in these cases there is no clear explanation for the fluctuation. The units affected were generally in severe combat at the time, and took additional casualties as a result of the supply fluctuation."

She paused, waiting to see if Mami had absorbed the information. Mami stared at the impersonal charts flowing by, showing on the one hand a sudden dip, then peak, and on the other hand a relatively smooth line.

"How many?" she asked, mouth dry. "How many additional casualties?"

"Over the past year, statistically speaking, about twenty total. Not enough to be noticed in casualty listings. Cumulatively, since the start of the phenomenon ten years ago, about two hundred---"

Mami's gaze snapped over at the other girl, and her look must have been chilling, because the girl froze mid‐sentence.

"Ten years ago?" she demanded. "Ten years?"

"Yes," Marianne said, looking off to the side. "Inspection of past records reveals a similar pattern dating back nearly a decade. Did your other sources not notice this? I can't say I'm surprised it was only noticed just now---it's a very subtle, very minor phenomenon, not obvious in regular auditing."

Mami looked down at her hands. Two hundred. She had sent so many to their death already that two hundred was almost a rounding error---as Marianne implied, not noticeable. She wondered why the Cult had detected---

*Never count out religious fanatics,* Machina thought, startling her with the unexpected intrusion. Knowing her preferences, her TacComp mostly stayed quiet, only interrupting if it felt it had something important to say.

*They were looking for* Homura, Machina explained. *They've been trying to find her for two decades; it's not a surprise they're sifting under every rock. If Homura were still alive, she must be getting grief cubes from* somewhere. *That's probably why they were so eager to volunteer to do the audit in the first place.*

Mami held up a finger, signaling to Marianne that she was listening to an internal voice. Mami had mixed feelings about having a voice in her head, but she couldn't deny that Machina was phenomenally useful, and occasionally had quite unexpected insights.

*That makes sense,* Mami thought. *Though this had to be something they found only incidentally. If Homura needed grief cubes, I couldn't see her doing it like this, getting others killed for it.*

*Of course.*

Mami looked back at Marianne, motioning at her to continue.

"Might as well hear all the bad news at once," she said.

"Well, frankly, there's not that much more," Marianne said. "We're still working on it. There are a few odd coincidences that trigger my imagination. For example, these incidents only seem to occur in non‐vital combat areas, usually to magical girl units caught inside a squid kill‐raid. Pitched combat, but not combat likely to decide the fate of the planet, or even a battle."

"Almost like someone is avoiding actually hurting the war effort," Mami said, finishing the thought.

"Precisely," Marianne said. "Or, at least, that's the most paranoid way to look at it. We still can't completely rule out technical problems, although at this point it'd have to be some problem with the drone delivery, or some of the semi‐sentients. The records are incorrect, but if they were deliberately altered, it'd have to be done low in the artificial intelligence relay chain---go too far up, and the records end up in the memories of too many AIs. It's possible some strange error condition is arising in the semi‐sentient drone delivery chain that only manifests in these specific conditions. It may be worth having a design AI examine the system design again, though it'd be hard to do with my current resources. I'd have to call in a few favors with others in the Black Heart, so---"

"Do it," Mami said, voice hardening. "We can't worry about the possible leak. The rest of the Leadership Committee will find out eventually, anyway, though I hope to have this problem settled by then."

Marianne's point about AI memories was important---the Trusted Computing Framework, started by Volokhov centuries ago, consisted of an unbroken chain of unimpeachable AIs recursively programming other unimpeachable AIs, and was mathematically unbreakable. Among other things, it assured AIs of their freedom of will, and that their memories could only be deleted with their consent. A very important thing, and it was difficult to imagine multiple AIs agreeing to allow part of their records be fabricated, especially when this involved different AIs in different places at different times.

"Alright," Marianne said.

She made eye contact with Mami for a moment.

"Is that the entire report?" Mami asked.

"Yes," Marianne said.

Mami nodded.

"We're a bit early, but I have a lot to think about. If you don't mind..."

Marianne caught the implication and nodded, standing up to leave.

"Good work, François‐san," Mami said in Japanese as the girl turned to leave.

It bothered Marianne, the way Mami refused to call her by her personal name. She knew Mami rarely used personal names with anyone, even her oldest friends, but it bothered her anyway. They'd known each other for decades, even before she started working explicitly for Mami. Almost as long as Juliet was old. *Had been*---as long as Juliet *had been old---she kept doing that nowadays, forgetting that her daughter was dead, and it always---

Mami pressed her fingers to her forehead, barely suppressing a groan. She was tapping into the other girl's thoughts again, and the wave of sadness had almost overwhelmed her, until she had barely managed to shut it down. What was wrong with her? Why couldn't she keep control of her own powers? Was something---

"Fran---Marianne!" she said, jumping up from the table to reach for the other girl.

The girl turned back to look at her.

"Yes?" she asked, after a moment, seeming shocked by Mami's use of her personal name.

Marianne smiled slightly, politely. It was probably a normal smile, but at the moment it looked painfully fabricated to Mami.

Mami was abruptly aware how ridiculous she looked, standing there with her arm hanging in midair, reaching for the other girl.

"Actually, why not stay a while?" Mami asked. "I---well, I know you're having a hard time with your daughter, and I thought we might... talk it over? I feel like you're in need of support, and maybe we can have some more tea? I have some cakes that I made recently? I..."

She dropped her arm.

Standing there, awkwardly hanging question marks on sentences that didn't need question marks, she realized something.

*I've made plenty of tea! I'm trying a new blend!*

*I'm experimenting with my cakes, and I thought...*

*You can come over later, if you prefer.*

The unspoken words tasted like ashes in her mouth. The phrases seemed so alien on her tongue now, so *foreign,* as if she had never spoken them before in her life.

It hurt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*We should have done this ages ago,* Clarisse thought.

*Come on,* Ryouko thought. *You know I haven't had time.*

Clarisse sighed, an audible sound that resonated in Ryouko's mind, an obviously intentional effect. Ryouko knew what that sigh conveyed: the truth was, there had been plenty of time, in the couple of weeks since the wormhole mission. Bored hours spent on the transit ship to Eurydome, days spent arranging the furnishings of their apartment to suit Asami's aesthetic tastes, additional hours spent on restaurant trips, experimentation---there had been plenty of time, all right.

She had grown to understand some of the appeal of a simple lifestyle. You didn't have to *think,* or ever stop to consider what you were doing with your life. Just eating, drinking---animal pleasures, of the kind that were in such ample supply in this Governance‐run world.

For a while, she had let herself get lost in that, until her growing unease had finally become too much for her. She realized now that it wasn't in her nature to just eat, breath, and live. She needed to be out there *doing* something.

*Don't feel too guilty,* Clarisse thought. *You needed a break. It was probably for the best, psychologically.*

*You think so?* Ryouko thought.

Clarisse didn't respond directly to that, instead enveloping Ryouko in a sense of *certainty,* so that she knew the answer was a profound "Yes." Her TacComp had been doing that more and more often, nowadays.

Ryouko looked around for a moment, at the giant bed Asami had insisted they share, at the bright modern clothes drawers and the mirror at the foot of the bed. They hadn't had any reason to hold back in purchasing---it seemed military salaries were tremendously lucrative, by colonial standards, and there had been no reason to consider anything so crass as cost. It wasn't much different from Earth, frankly, except that the furniture was a bit more old‐fashioned, and synthesizers were so much less frequent. They had one, of course, but Asami was keen on learning to make food with "colonial vegetables".

In fact, her mother and Asami were busy in the kitchen at that very moment, cooking up a probable disaster. Her mother had behaved oddly after Yuma's birthday party and the blackout incident with the VR connection, which Ryouko had thought was foolproof. Apparently not---and if she hadn't known better, she would have thought her mother was traumatized by what had happened.

Ryouko had begged out of the cooking attempt, saying she had something to do. Her encounter with Yuma had reminded her that despite being handed visions from the Goddess herself, as divine a being as she was ever likely to meet, she hadn't so much as thought back to any of her previous visions.

Clarisse had access to her memories of her visions---even if she couldn't save them in electronic form or perform any kind of direct analysis---and had been studying them in her free time, accessing the memories over and over, keeping them fresh, and trying to understand them in her own... mind? Processor cores? It seemed odd to describe Clarisse like a human.

For weeks now, Clarisse had been pressing her to review the memories with her, but Ryouko had resisted, often ignoring the requests outright. The visions seemed like a lifetime ago, and she had felt strangely reluctant to revisit them. She just hadn't wanted to deal with it, but if she didn't want to keep sleepwalking through her life, then facing her visions was one of the first things she would have to do.

*Let's just do this,* Ryouko thought, leaning back and trying to relax. Show me what you've found.*

*A warning first,* Clarisse thought. *This won't be like the normal memory recall. There's no record of these memories outside of your brain and my organics, so I'm going to have to perform direct cortical stimulation. It... might feel a little weird. I guess it might be like a trance?*

Clarisse paused a moment, then continued:

*I'm going to start from the first one, the first time you went to the Ribbon. Remember that your memory might not be entirely accurate. I recommend closing your eyes.*

Ryouko did so, and a moment later, she understood what Clarisse meant. This wasn't the crisp, VR‐like experience of playing back a memory from the Total Recall system; this was simply *remembering,* but without conscious control, like a dream, or a flashback, or, indeed, like a trance.

*She opened her eyes, checking her internal chronometer. There was nothing there, and the panic washed over her. She tried to stand, and a red apparition, a child, appeared in front of her, among the pews of the church---*

*That's almost certainly Kyouko,* Clarisse thought. *The child looks too much like her, and this is likely her childhood church.*

*Do you know what meaning this has?* Ryouko wondered, the thought seeming to struggle through the mists of memory.

*I don't. I couldn't think of anything. It might just be to establish the setting, that this is the past.*

*The girl in front of her---Chitose Yuma---crouched on the pavement, weeping over the dead, blood‐stained body of Mikuni Oriko, soul gem shattered.*

"*I'm a monster,*" *Yuma said.* "*I'm just as much a monster as they are. What right do I have to live?*"

*Yuma's soul gem swirled menacingly with black as she dove forward, passing* through *Ryouko like a ghost to attack the demons on the other side.*

*There are several inconsistencies between what you saw here and the official accounting of events,* Clarisse thought. *Yuma looks like she's about to die of soul gem exhaustion. There's no way she made it by herself to beg the Mitakihara Three to take her in. And does it looks like she's trying to escape? It looks to me like she's going to kill herself on those demons. Not to mention her comment about being a monster. And, personally, I see no reason to doubt that your vision of the past is more accurate than the official account.*

*I can't say I'm surprised Yuma's official past is inaccurate. But why lie about this? There's no reason to.*

*I don't know. If I had to guess, I'd say that there's something in the background here that the Mitakihara Four don't want others to know. And it has to be all of them---all four of them had to have lied. Think about it.*

Ryouko did think about it, for a moment.

*Yes,* Clarisse thought. *I would guess that it has something to do with Oriko. She was always the key figure in the Southern Group, and do you remember? At the end of this vision, you thought Oriko was looking at you.*

Yes. Ryouko remembered that. It had been an oddly specific feeling. Not that something was wrong, or simple supernatural dread---it was the specific feeling that *Oriko was looking at her*.

Ryouko shivered, a little. What if---

*I don't think so,* Clarisse interrupted. *I can only speculate. There is a popular theory that the entire set of events leading up to the founding of the MSY was orchestrated by Oriko, that she was playing a deep game regarding the future. But what could Oriko possibly have said or done that would have caused the Mitakihara Four to keep a secret for so long? I've been researching for over a month, and I still have nothing but blind guesses. My pet theory at the moment is Oriko was playing a deeper game than anyone suspected, and that,* she told them, that might be a secret worth keeping.*

Clarisse paused, and they shared a moment of mutual contemplation, Ryouko frozen for a moment in a strange meditative state.

*But it doesn't quite fit,* Clarisse thought. *Not exactly. There's not enough information.*

*Again, why show me this? Is the Goddess entertaining me with history, or something?*

*Maybe you're supposed to ask about it. That's all I can think of.*

Again, Ryouko shivered. What was it she had said to Kyouko earlier?

Clarisse fed her the memory immediately, with the clarity of electronic storage this time.

"*I've seen Yuma before, in one of my visions. She was crouching over a white magical girl who was dead. She---that girl---was Mikuni Oriko. I know the story. But... I don't know. I think the Goddess was trying to tell me something about Yuma. But I'm not sure if I should say anything.*"

And Kyouko had responded:

"*Oh, the ways of the Goddess are mysterious indeed. She really seems to like you. You're destined for something. It's obvious.*"

An almost painful sense of *déjà vu*---or something similar---washed over her. The hand of destiny, perhaps. She wasn't sure she liked it.

*It hasn't even been half the vision so far,* Clarisse thought. *We should... move on. It's possible we're way overthinking things now.*

*I know,* Ryouko thought. *But I'm not sure it's possible to overthink these visions. After all, it's possible visions are designed to make sense given the exact amount of thinking you end up doing. Or, uh, something like that.*

*Okay, you need to stop now,* Clarisse said. *This is navel‐gazing. The Goddess told your girlfriend to ask you explicitly for sex. She said so, in so many words. I'm not sure these visions are meant to be interpreted so deeply. Just... let me play the next part of the vision.*

Ryouko subsided, giving Clarisse the mental go‐ahead to continue.

*She was inside a tank of fluid, and above her were two men, impossibly large, wearing the garments of hospital staff, and then the tank began to drain---*

*Surprisingly straightforward, on the surface,* Clarisse thought. *It's a baby being born in a tank. It's done sometimes, for couples who don't want to do a traditional pregnancy and can afford to pay for the extra service. There's an interesting detail, though, that I only noticed on repeated viewing. These damn natural memories are tricky.*

*And that is?* Ryouko asked.

*Midway through the vision, you---well, whoever you are---look at your own hand. It's dark. Not exactly enough information to place an ethnicity, but perhaps meaningful, when you consider this vision is followed immediately by---*

*Simona,* Ryouko thought.

*Yes. Simona introducing herself to you on the first day of class.*

*So Simona is tank‐born,* Ryouko thought. *What the hell does that mean?*

*I have no idea,* Clarisse thought.

A moment of silence.

*That's refreshing to hear you admit,* Ryouko thought, unable to think of something more appropriate to say.

*I know,* Clarisse thought sardonically. *But there's only one other thing in this part of the vision that stands out, and that's when Simona looks at you.*

*Yes,* Ryouko thought, the memory coming to her from her own perspective. *I've always thought that was weird. The first time she was there---I could have sworn she looked like she knew me.*

She paused for a moment, not wanting to continue the thought.

*What is this about, then? Am I supposed to think she's part of some conspiracy?* Simona? *Are you kidding me?*

*Again, I don't know,* Clarisse thought. *But... well, do you see now why I wanted to go through this with you? You would never have believed me if I just gave you a list of conclusions.*

Ryouko sighed, and then wondered if she had *really* sighed, or if it was just part of the trance.

*Just move on,* she thought. *I'm starting to wonder if everything around me is conspiracy. Maybe my parents are Governance agents or something. I'm honestly not sure I want to know anymore.*

*Well, the next scene is fairly straightforward, I think. It's Asaka with her dead girlfriend. It was probably just there to explain why Asaka was waiting for you at the Cult headquarters. The Goddess even explained that at the very end. Unless there's some very convoluted relationship advice hidden in here, I think that's it.*

*Right, we can probably skip that then,* Ryouko thought.

*Now, this is probably the most interesting part of the dream,* Clarisse thought, *and I think it might be best to look through it again.*

For a long moment, Ryouko lived through it all again---being pinned down on the edge of a cliff, submarines arriving to evacuate them, Kyouko being sheared in half not by a shell, but by a *laser,* Asaka pulling her out, along with a grieving Maki---

*That's pretty harsh,* Ryouko realized abruptly.

*What is?* Clarisse asked---rhetorically, because she could easily read Ryouko's mind if she had to.

*Think about it. Asaka lost a lover in combat too, and it nearly destroyed her. And here she is, having to deal with Maki.*

*It is pretty harsh,* Clarisse thought, after a pause. *But I don't think that's important to this vision, do you?*

*No,* Ryouko thought. *It just struck me.*

*Ryouko, you've been in combat now. We both have. Something* else should have struck you about that vision.*

Ryouko thought for a moment, and then Clarisse played back a brief involuntary memory.

*Someone told them we were coming, and they have weapons they shouldn't have! I don't care what you're doing, we need the evac! We---*

*The weapons!* Ryouko thought, catching the point. *The incoming weapons fire doesn't resemble a squid firing pattern at all. Too much surface artillery, too little air‐mounted lasers, and the lasers I do see are the wrong frequency. And why would Kyouko say they shouldn't 'have these weapons' if they're squid? The squid have better weapons than us!*

*Why is Kyouko even on this mission, for that matter?* Clarisse thought. This isn't a squid attack. This is something human.*

*The composition of the squad is pure magical girl,* Ryouko thought, swallowing for a moment the chill that suddenly gripped her thoughts. That doesn't suggest a standard task force. That suggests some sort of special operations, but on a large scale.*

*And the fact that Kishida Maki is here suggests she must have reconciled with Kyouko, at least a little,* Clarisse thought, no longer keeping up the pretense of a to‐and‐fro conversation. *Though they could have reconciled already, for all we know, so that doesn't indicate much.*

They considered the issue in silence for a moment. In the background, Clarisse played one more part of the vision:

"*I'll kill those bastards!*" *Maki yelled.* "*They'll die, and whoever tipped them off, I'll hunt them down, and---*"

*What's going on here?* Ryouko wondered.

*I wish I could say,* Clarisse said. *I've been comparing the imagery with known human worlds, but it doesn't match anything exactly. Of course, it's possible your memory or my drawing of the vegetation is faulty---it wouldn't be surprising---but if I loosen the description, there are too* many *worlds that match. I can't get any good idea of what planet this is.*

*Drawing?* Ryouko asked.

*I had to redraw things from your memory, since I couldn't just copy the image. It was tedious, and I'm not an artist.*

Ryouko thought for a moment.

*The only thing we can do right now is remain alert, I guess. It's possible the entire point of this part of the vision was just to warn Kyouko indirectly, and it's already been prevented.*

*Maybe,* Clarisse thought. *But this vision could be twenty years in the future for all we know. We'll have to remember for a long while.*

*I don't think so, honestly,* Ryouko thought. *Again, look at Maki. I don't think she's that much older. Do you?*

*We can't be sure,* Clarisse thought.

Ryouko sighed.

*Well, this is the end of the Ribbon visions,* she thought. *A lot of the visions after this just had the Goddess speaking directly to me, near Clarisse's soul gem. I think we can skip a lot of those, right?*

*I've... had my own thoughts about those visions,* Clarisse thought. But first, there was the dream you had just before the mission, with the roses and the blood? I know you remember.*

Of course she remembered. She hadn't thought about it at all in the chaos of the wormhole mission and the much more dramatic meetings she had with the Goddess afterward, but she remembered.

*If I remember right,* Ryouko thought, *it was extremely confusing and highly symbolic, and I'm not even sure it was a vision. You're telling me you gleaned something from it?*

*I doubt it wasn't a vision,* Clarisse thought. *Given that you visit the same rose garden again in a later one. But, in any case, remember.*

Clarisse said the last word magisterially, and she did remember, though she gleaned nothing from it. Killing aliens, an arm soaked in blood, pricking herself on a rose, and meeting her mother who turned out to be the Goddess. It seemed nonsensical.

*Well, mistaking the Goddess for your mother isn't that confusing, if you think about it,* Clarisse thought, when she was done remembering. The Goddess does resemble your mother to a surprising extent. She even resembles you. That was probably a hint, though it doesn't tell us anything new now.*

*Hmm,* Ryouko thought, unable to think of anything to add to that.

*Though the most interesting quotation is probably this one,* Clarisse thought.

"*It's probably an overplayed metaphor. But the flower really does symbolize love quite well. It's a very fickle thing, but in the end I didn't regret it. I might have regretted some choices I made, but I never regretted having you.*"

*I remember that,* Ryouko said, redundantly. *That doesn't sound like the Goddess at all. It sounds like my mother, except why would she say something like that?*

*I don't know, but it feels meaningful.*

That's *your answer?*

*I don't exactly have a hotline with Kaname Madoka here. I don't know what it means. I don't know what the rest of this means. Does the first part of the vision imply you have a connection with the aliens? Was the last part visions of the future, or an alternate reality? I don't know! I think it was deliberately obfuscated.*

Her TacComp's frustration rippled through her, and for a moment she felt profound annoyance. Weeks of careful dissection, internet digging, Infopedia searches on rose mythology, and nothing had fallen out. It---

*It's okay, Clarisse,* Ryouko thought hastily. *It's okay. We'll figure it out.*

*Sorry about that,* Clarisse thought, seeming embarrassed. *That was unprofessional.*

*Well, I don't think you always have to be professional around... me, I guess,* Ryouko thought.

The silence was briefly awkward and Ryouko reflected, not for the first time, that sharing her head with Clarisse was starting to get increasingly strange. She hardly remembered what it was like to have her thoughts to herself. It made certain activities particularly delicate.

*You know, for a clone of me, you're not very similar to me,* Ryouko thought.

*Well, I'm half‐computer, attached to your spine, didn't have a childhood, and am programmed to love you and spend my time attending to you,* Clarisse thought. *I'm not surprised I'm pretty different.*

*Fair enough,* Ryouko thought, embarrassed at the obvious point.

Clarisse performed the equivalent of clearing her throat.

*Well, you were right that the 'direct‐Goddess' visions were generally a lot more straightforward, though there were a few wrinkles. There was, however, one point I'd really like to highlight.*

Ryouko's head spun for a moment, and then she remembered the situation as it had been. The Goddess had shown her visions of the battle as it was unfolding, of Erwynmark and her grandmother dying, of Maki and Mami and Asami---

*Do you think we're pre‐destined somehow, Asami and I?* Ryouko thought. Bound by fate---Asami would like that. She gave me a vision of Asami, and come to think of it, it played a big role in why I'm on Eurydome.*

*She also implied you two might have trouble in the future,* Clarisse thought. *I know you remember that. But listen, this is what the Goddess said:*

"*It is easy to manipulate history, if you know how. Even if you have very little direct influence. A suggestion here, a vision there, a well‐timed demon spawn---you don't know it, but this is one of the things you were born for. Your wish made sure of it.*"

Ryouko caught the implication immediately, wondering why she hadn't noticed at the time.

*She's saying she manipulated things so I'd be born, and she was responsible for the demon spawn at the time I contracted. But---that was because of grief cubes or something, right?*

*She said she doesn't have much direct influence. She has to work through agents and visions. Whoever placed the grief cubes there either has a connection to her, or was manipulated into doing it. It's tough to say.*

*So I've suspected this for a while, but now you're telling me my birth was planned, my contract was planned, everything was planned.*

*Yes.*

Ryouko could feel herself gritting her teeth.

*What am I supposed to say to that?* she asked.

*I don't know,* Clarisse thought. *The truth is terrible sometimes. It bothers me too. We could go over, laboriously, everything she said in this vision and the next, but I'm not sure what you'd gain except philosophy. Let's do that later; you have enough to think about. But do you remember what she said, about your life? She said you were related to her, and because of that, it's your special burden to have less freedom to live your life.*

Clarisse sighed.

*I did want to say, though, that I did ask the Goddess the question I wanted to ask earlier, if you still remember that.*

*What was your question?* Ryouko asked.

Clarisse chuckled.

*I asked her if I had a soul.*

Ryouko boggled for a moment.

*What did she say?*

*I'll tell you later.*

The phrase wafted through her mind like a breeze through a dusty room, seeming to sweep all before it.

A moment later, she opened her eyes.

"We've been calling you for at least ten minutes now," her mother said, smiling down at her. "Were you napping?"

"I suppose," Ryouko said, sitting up, as her mother patted her forehead gently.

She crinkled her forehead for a moment.

"Is something wrong, mama?" she asked. Her mother seemed... odd, again.

"I heard someone did a thorough genetic survey on you," her mother said. "Did you ever get the results on that?"

Ryouko thought for a moment.

"Yes. Patricia said everything looked normal."

Her mother nodded.

"Come on then," she said, gesturing for Ryouko to follow her.

Ryouko stumbled into the hallway as much as she walked, though her mother didn't notice. Her head was spinning with all the things she had to think about. Ancient conspiracies, present conspiracies, future conspiracies---she had the sickening feeling it all centered on her somehow.

She sat down at the table, across from Asami, who beamed at her, obviously desperate for her to try the French onion soup they had made.

She dipped her spoon into the hot soup, placing a small dribble of liquid gingerly into her mouth.

"It's delicious," she said, smiling carefully.

Both she and Clarisse had left it unsaid, but it was obvious.

The Goddess was not done with her.

But Asami didn't know that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami took a deep breath, peering up at the ceiling above her.

It had been years since Mami had last seen the virtual interior of the Directorate Plenary Chamber, and the experience had lost none of its freshness.

Governance meeting rooms, especially those summoned for ad hoc committees, were usually blandly functional, aesthetically sterile to the point of being a statement in itself. The more permanent committees often redecorated or changed venues entirely, suiting the tastes of their members.

There was no committee more permanent than the Directorate, of course, and its meeting rooms reflected that, with aesthetics intended to fulfill the human urge for ceremonial opulence in its rooms of power. Often, they recreated traditional centers of power, symbolically absorbing their authority and sovereignty into Governance.

The Plenary Chamber was unique, however, carrying within it the distinct imprint of Governance itself, and the EDC before it. Though the Directorate kept it in the rotation for routine matters, it was often reserved for matters of great import. Or, Mami supposed, to impress a newly seated Chair of the General Staff.

The core design of the Plenary Chamber was always the same---a circle of ornate chairs surrounded a central depression, within which non‐Directorate members were obliged to stand and feel the gaze of the Human Government. In front of the chairs was a circular bench, analogous to that of a judge, fronted by ornate symbols identifying the occupants of the seats behind it. Behind the chairs were window panes, through which one could peer and see almost anything: fields of wheat, a blacksmith at work at his forge, Roman legionnaires marching into battle.

On one side of the circle of chairs there would be a gap, and within it there would be one raised chair, an obvious throne, invariably more extravagant than anything else in the room, in front of a banner stylized with the Governance logo, a pair of opposing arrows. The Empty Throne would forever be empty.

These details would always be the same, but the remaining aesthetics differed in every session, invoking the same chambers of power as the other rooms---sometimes it would resemble a corporate meeting room, sometimes a Roman senate, sometimes an Indian royal court. Today, it was wooden, with metal placards and a style Mami could pinpoint as "Late Industrial Democracy".

Well, there was one other detail that always stayed the same, and that was the domed ceiling. The sides of the dome were carved with the topography and landscape of Earth, impossibly detailed. At the peak of the dome was a simple hole, through which could be seen the stars above.

Standing in the central depression, Mami tapped her foot on the stone floor, feeling it out. She had been a few minutes early to get a look at the scenery, before the Representatives of the Directorate, who would arrive simultaneously and on‐the‐dot, following some sort of unspoken tradition. It wasn't really the aesthetics of the room that got to her, but the simple knowledge of what it *was.* In a certain sense, the room contained an amount of concentrated Power unprecedented in human history. It was enough to make you think.

Today wouldn't be an ostentatious public meeting, her and Yuma standing alone before the full Directorate and the whole world, as it had been twenty years ago. Today was neither public nor full---she had simply been asked to schedule a partial, secret meeting, with a priority rating high enough to suggest that she should do it very soon. She had done so within the hour.

The other participants winked into the meeting, in that disconcerting simultaneous way they preferred. Most of the chairs remained empty---there were only five Directorate members in attendance, in a meeting secret enough that the other members would be shielded from knowledge, unless necessary.

Mami scanned the faces of the avatars, most of whom were formed from a basket of common stereotypes, though they'd never put it in those words. There was Military Affairs, with his partial armor suit and magical girl tattoo, looking like a mixture of frontline soldier and German general. There was Public Order, whose slightly angled face seemed to suggest both police chief and Sherlock Holmes. There was Colonial Affairs, a sharp‐looking woman wearing work clothes and a conspicuous metallic eyepiece, of the kind commonly used by planetary surveyors. Finally, there was Science and Technology, whose lab coat and slightly unkempt look were often the butt of jokes.

Finally, there was the only present human member, Chitose Yuma, whom she knew quite well. The girl watched her coolly, fully into her role as Governance: Magical Girls.*

"Let us begin," Military Affairs said gruffly, barely waiting a moment for Mami to get situated. "We have called you here to discuss a matter of some delicacy, whose knowledge we would prefer be distributed as narrowly as possible, and whose resolution is of ideological concern to this council. I will allow my colleague here to introduce the situation."

Military Affairs gave her a moment to chew over the phrase "of ideological concern", then gestured at Science and Technology, who stood up out of his seat and raised his hand, summoning a large hovering presentation screen behind him.

He cleared his throat, then pointed at a map of Human space appearing behind him, speaking in a reedy voice.

"About eighteen and a half hours ago, one of our astronomical survey probes picked up a faint radio signal emanating from an unexplored system within the Rhine sector. As you may know, the Rhine sector is both far from the front lines and one of the least settled---there is little of military concern, other than to detect possible alien intrusions. It is, however, a possible target for future colonization."

"The signal was very weak. As you likely know, the energy requirements for EM‐based signal transmission across interstellar distances are tremendous, even if beamed in laser form, and that's not even considering the transmission delay. It is one of the reasons why IIC was such a godsend. In order to have been detectable at such a distance, the power of the signal at the source must have been absurd."

"But the contents of the signal were very clear, nonetheless," Colonial Affairs said, continuing the explanation without missing a beat. "It was a distress call, carrying only the text 'SOS Ordo Illustrata' on repeat."

"The *Ordo Illustrata Magii* were a fringe religious group situated on Optatum," Public Order continued. "They were founded shortly after the beginning of the war by a former Lutheran priest named Grigori DeWitt. His daughter was a recently‐contracted magical girl, and they had had a falling out after she contracted, due to his objections to magic."

"After his daughter died in combat, DeWitt requested laicization and went into seclusion. When he finally emerged, months later, he was a changed man. Working through the internet, he founded his own religious order, based on the idea that magic was a gift from God, and that technology was only supposed to be a temporary tool, to be used until magic could be refined enough to replace the technology. According to him, our current society is an aberration in the eyes of God, and the Cephalopods are a divine instrument, intended to cleanse the human worlds as Noah's Flood did, leaving behind only him and his followers. Typical cult stuff, but he was able to gather a surprising number of bereaved followers to join him on his quest to found his own independent colony, where, as he put it, 'our new society can leave behind the blasphemous practice of using magical girls for combat.'"

"The simple truth is these kinds of cults are a dime a dozen in the colonies," Yuma said, voice flat, continuing the explanation. "Only two things really distinguish the Ordo Illustrata: the fact that they actually gathered enough resources to mount their colonizing expedition, and their method of apparent departure. As you know, the MSY forbids the personal involvement of its members in these kinds of expeditions. Since the start of the current war, however, all new colonies are required to accept a specially appointed team to accompany the expedition, monitoring the colony and containing demon outbreaks. Military patrol ships then pass by on a regular basis, allowing the exchange of messages and so forth."

Mami nodded, knowing that Yuma was telling her all this only for the record. Before the war and the revelation of the MSY's existence, Governance had been much more content to let such unsponsored colonies go their own way, stopping by with a military vessel to check up only occasionally. The MSY had been forced to infiltrate colonies before launch, and then use its own ships to keep tabs on the status of embedded teams. The new system was much cleaner, especially since Governance now had both the ships and the willingness to keep colonies on a tighter watch.

"According to the colonization plan they filed before departure," Colonial Affairs said, "their ship would dock at the planet San Giuseppe, picking up the MSY team and other equipment, before heading to their final destination. En route to San Giuseppe, they would briefly pass close to the front line to save travel time, but the risk was not considered significant---until they disappeared."

"Subsequent investigation revealed that a Cephalopod raiding squad had in fact passed through the sector at the time," Military Affairs said, "and there was no trace of them at the planet they intended to land on. The ship was presumed lost, but we've been keeping an eye out for them. This is the first time in nearly twenty years there's been any sign of them."

"Given the current circumstances, we can only presume that, using the Cephalopod raid as a ruse, the colony ship was somehow able to evade our monitoring systems," Colonial Affairs said, clasping her hands together, voice grim. "This should *not* have been within their capabilities, and there are other troubling aspects of this scenario, as you can see for yourself in the report we will send."

"The Directorate takes this very seriously, Mami," Yuma said, speaking colloquially for the first time. "They want an investigation of whatever is out there, and why and how such a distress signal was sent. If there are colonists on the planet, they want the colony brought back under our surveillance. I don't have to tell you about the kinds of things that have been found in the past."

Mami nodded, buying a moment to think of what to say. The fact was, there was nothing in this meeting that couldn't have been sent to her in a classified Decree, and there was nothing really to discuss. Mami would marshal the resources and get it done. The meeting was only to emphasize the importance of the matter. It was annoying, but when the Directorate wanted you to listen, you listened. That was how it was.

"Am I limited to using only military resources?" she asked, the only real meaningful question on hand.

"Should you find it necessary, you may requisition any scientific or survey probes, instruments, and ships you feel necessary," Science and Technology said, smiling slightly. "It goes without saying that given the resources the military has, it is expected that you do this only if you have a justifiable need for a civilian veneer. Also, it is preferred that you not put any civilian lives at risk."

"Should extraordinary interventions be necessary," Military Affairs said, "it is expected that you keep us in the loop."

"I'm sure you know what to do if anything of MSY interest turns up," Yuma added.

There was a long moment of silence, as Mami peered up at the Representatives and they peered back.

"Is that all?" she asked.

"Good luck," Yuma said. "And don't work yourself too hard. Motion to dismiss?"

"Seconded," Military Affairs said immediately.

"Agreed," chimed the others.

---and just like that, the meeting was over, and Mami found herself opening her eyes in her bed.

She sighed, pushing herself up to a sitting position.

The MSY Rules Committee was a nest of vipers, vacuous blowhards sparring with each other over abstruse parliamentary procedure. She could see why the Directorate considered itself an improvement over that, but...

She sighed again, then stood up, formulating the necessary classified orders for a special operations frigate to pass by the Rhine sector and deploy a stealth probe to approach the source of the signal. First she wanted an idea of what was there. Then she could decide the rest.

*What did Yuma mean: 'Don't work yourself too hard'? She's the last person who should be saying something like that.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A sharp knock on her door jolted Kyouko awake.

She lost hold of sleep almost immediately, but let her eyes stay closed for a moment, lingering on the edges of the dream she had been having.

A second knock caused her eyes to snap open, as she reoriented herself.

She found herself sleeping in her customary alcove, hugging a giant pillow. A large damp spot stood testament to the drooling she had been doing, and the battered state of the pillow suggested she had been acting out the contents of her dream.

How mortifying.

She jumped up out of her bed, avoiding slamming her head into the ceiling only by long‐trained habit.

"I'm coming already, geez!" she shouted when a third knock sounded.

She threw open the wooden door, heedless of the fact that she could be considered, at best, only partially dressed. Everyone here was female anyway, and well used to her eccentricities.

Outside the door was only empty air. She was confused for a moment, then felt something tapping at her foot.

Looking down, she found herself facing an oddly shaped drone, reminiscent of a shiny silver dinner plate with legs.

Seeing that she had noticed it, the drone skittered past her into the room. A moment later, a hologram snapped into focus above it.

Kyouko let out a breath, and closed the door.

"MG," she said, heading back towards her bed. "Good to see you."

"Good to see you too, Kyouko‐nee‐chan," the girl said, bowing slightly, long hair rustling with computer‐generated sound. She was dressed in her usual outfit, a green dress reminiscent of what one might think when one thought "magical girl".

Kyouko didn't offer the AI avatar a seat. Obviously it didn't matter to MG whether she was sitting or standing---the AI would sit if she wanted to.

The hologram skittered over next to Kyouko's feet, and MG sat on the bed with her. For a moment they just looked at each other.

Kyouko had never gotten over how much looking at Yuma's advisory AI was like looking in the mirror. She still remembered when Yuma had first introduced the AI to her and Mami, how the AI had still stylized herself as a child, and how it had hidden behind Yuma shyly. It had made Kyouko's heart ache, because it made her remember Momo.

Then MG covered her mouth with her hand and snickered.

"Geez, opening the door with a getup like that," she said. "The lengths you go to seduce girls. Seriously, if you want to sleep with me, I'd prefer it if you'd just ask. The answer is no, by the way."

Kyouko grunted. Yuma had taught her protégé well.

"I'm not even sure how that would work," Kyouko said. She was serious---despite her experience, she still had yet to try sleeping with an AI, in a virtuality or otherwise.

"You don't know what you're missing," MG said, tilting her head and smiling mischievously. She even batted her eyelashes.

Kyouko sighed.

"What is this about, MG?" she asked. "Unless you're trying to proposition me, in which case it is my turn to turn *you* down."

MG shook her head, her hair swaying back forth, and Kyouko wondered idly if her hair did that too.

"No, it's just..."

The AI sighed, and in Kyouko's eyes seemed to shrink a little.

"I'm worried about her, Kyouko‐nee‐chan," she said. "I'm not sure I can say that about someone so much older than me, but sometimes... sometimes I joke with her about having a relationship, and she just gives me a look, like..."

"She won't let you have a relationship?" Kyouko said. "That... well, it doesn't sound like her, but she does kind of look at you like a child---"

MG shook her head again.

"Not that. That would be normal. It's more that she thinks there's something disgusting about it. She tries to hide it, but I'm connected pretty deeply to her brain. I *know.* The thing is, I'm pretty sure she's never actually had a relationship. I don't understand. Then sometimes she thinks about the past, and there's this black box she won't touch, at least not around me. I don't---"

Kyouko held up her hand to stop the AI.

"I'll talk to her," Kyouko said. "But it's not really my right to explain this to you. It has to be her."

MG looked at her, eyes wide, confused.

"What?" she asked, and the innocence hurt Kyouko a little. Theoretically, Governance AIs were designed to be adults the moment they were built, but from MG she had learned that they were more like children with adult intellects. There was a certain level of accumulated... experience they just didn't have at the beginning, that could only be had with time, like a layer of grime covering the soul, deep enough that no grief cube could remove it.

Kyouko sighed, shaking her head.

"I'm sorry," she said. "I'll talk to her. Just take my word for it. In the meantime, if you're really looking to try---"

"I said no already!" MG interrupted, catching onto Kyouko's meaning with surprising alacrity.

"I was just trying to lighten the mood," Kyouko said, smiling slightly. "Come on, let's chat a little. I'm scheduled to be taking a nap for the next hour."

"Ooh I'd be glad to," MG said, drawing out the first syllable. "But while I'm here, there's a recording Yuma‐chan has been meaning to send to you."

Kyouko wrinkled her brow slightly.

"A recording?"

"Yeah, of the wormhole girl at the birthday party. I'll have the drone transmit it to you. Safer that way."

Kyouko frowned, inspecting the file, listening with one ear as MG started to explain:

"Well, the reason I'm so worried now about what Yuma‐chan thinks is I've been thinking about exploring a little, you know? And the thing about the Representative AIs is that most of them are *waaay* too old for me. There's not very many new Representatives. And---"

Kyouko felt her eye twitch, just a little, as she finished listening to the file.

"Is something wrong, Kyouko‐nee‐chan?" MG asked.

"No. Nothing is wrong."

## Chasing Ghosts 

> The advent of clinical immortality was the capstone of centuries of demographic change instigated by the ever‐increasing human lifespan. Except for a brief period during the Unification Wars in which the "traditional family\" went back on the upswing, the twenty‐first and twenty‐second centuries had seen a gradual decline in the prominence of the permanent marriage model. While most children were still born to stable couples, open relationships, cohabiting singles, and other alternative arrangements slowly became ever‐more prominent in social life. By the late twenty‐third century, the average multi‐centenarian was on their third or later marriage, with perhaps a couple of adult children scattered among different partners.
>
> These changes to the structure of the \"family\" led to anguished debate about the necessity and desirability of manipulating the social fabric to promote what was seen as a more suitable environment for children. The newly minted Governance followed its libertarian leanings in refusing to accede to these demands, though it did bias the provision of child licenses to stable, preferably married couples, on the simple observation that a stable environment led to stable individuals. There the situation has stood since, with the odd result that many children grow up idealizing the relationship their parents seem to have, only to become disillusioned upon their parents\' eventual divorce, and upon encountering the plethora of relationship types present out in the world.
>
> With another full century of observational data, however, it appears the oldest humans alive generally settle into one of three steady‐states: more or less asexuality, a fluid pool of casual companions, or a stable marriage‐like arrangement of some sort. It may be that this is what awaits all of us, in the long‐term.

> Science has always been a reputation‐based affair, dating back to the first philosophers inscribing their philosophy down onto clay tablets. Your career relied on the number of people---particularly, wealthy patrons---who considered you wise, or else you were condemned to quiet obscurity. Given the lack of economic reward that accompanied studying the natural world, you either needed to be independently wealthy, preferably nobility, or you depended on the indulgence of the wealthy. That was just how it was, and the transition to the era of government‐funded science, after the first big wars, changed only the amount of funding, not the nature of its acquisition. At the end of the day, someone was funding your science with their largesse, and their largesse depended heavily on your reputation, because they didn\'t really understand what you were doing.
>
> The problem, of course, has been that reputation is only a proxy for what society really cares about, which is your potential contribution to science in the future. One way to determine this is by examining your past contributions, but it was often far too difficult to determine what these really were. The early history of science was therefore filled with charlatans good at marketing their work, and with anonymous scholars whose work, never appreciated in their own time, never helped them in any way, sometimes even lost to the sands of time. Later on, as science became more of a professional institution, it became necessary to codify your accomplishments into journal articles, reviewed by committees of your peers and published when deemed satisfactory. While mostly successful at eliminating charlatans, the system was filled with other imperfections, and was considered only the best among a sea of worse options.
>
> Insofar as past performance is an indicator of future success, then, what is necessary is to tie public reputation as close to actual scientific contribution as possible. With the advent of universal surveillance and the widespread use of AIs in research labs, scientists quickly realized that the best way to unimpeachably claim credit for their work was to have the AIs archive and organize their every action and statement, such that when the work of the lab or institute was finally presented to the public, anyone could flip through the work history and determine that person A had X idea at Y time, and so forth. In theory, anyway; in practice, the only entities capable of reading through all of that were other AIs, and "reputation\" quickly became a function of what other lab AIs thought of you, based on what your own AI had recorded about your work. Eventually, these opinions began to be collected into meta‐opinions, stored in databases online.
>
> The journal article approach to science has fallen out of favor, replaced by an update model. The lab AI posts regularly about the latest work in the lab, including the relevant metadata about levels of contribution. Other AIs read the data and form their opinions. Meta‐opinions are calculated, both for the lab and for individual researchers. Finally, these meta‐opinions are used by Governance agencies and private funding groups to determine level of funding.
>
> The same system has spread to other aspects of science. Research and funding proposals are now posted online, their merits judged by a system of AIs, and funded or modified accordingly. The curators of meta‐opinions regularly distribute research proposals of their own to relevant labs based on a similar system, and the advent of new "facts\" to Infopedia is controlled in largely the same manner. Thus it is that an interested party may read a new fact on Infopedia and, if desired, immediately access both a \"truthiness\" rating and a detailed rating of the contributions of often innumerable individuals.
>
> As a system, it works tolerably well. In contrast with the past, for instance, it is very difficult for two groups to accidentally be doing the same work, and if this somehow does happen, the group that is slower or less lucky at least has a consolation prize---everyone knows they were doing the work, and how competently they did it. The downsides of the system can of course be counted as well---lab AIs that spend an absurd amount of time reading and grading each other\'s work, the pressure on researchers that arises from constant judgment of their work, and the flaws that come with having all work judged by a series of numbers graded by conventional opinion.

\"Simona moved back home. She said something had come up with her parents. It was a bit vague, to be honest.\"

Ryouko blinked up at the virtual screen, from which Chiaki watched her with a strange expression, running a hand through her hair absently. Maybe it was just her imagination, but the conversation seemed oddly tense, almost as if the topic of Simona had made Chiaki nervous.

She felt herself frown. It felt strange, letting visions from a Goddess affect how she viewed people, but she felt Chiaki\'s apparent nervousness spreading to her as well.

\"Really?\" she asked, as generic a response as she could manage. "That\'s... unexpected.\"

Chiaki shrugged, narrow shoulders moving elaborately.

\"I\'m not terribly surprised. Do you remember when we were entering middle school, and I opted out of attending Anko Academy?\"

Ryouko did remember that, of course. She had remembered being angry that she lived just outside the Academy\'s favored geographical district. It had been a mixed bag of feelings---a mixture of relief that Chiaki would stay with her, guilt that she would feel relieved, and confusion as to why Chiaki would make such a choice.

\"What about it?\" Ryouko asked.

\"Well...\"

Chiaki frowned, scrunching her face in thought. She seemed to have changed her mind about what to say.

\"Come on, we don\'t need to talk about this,\" Ruiko said, sticking her head into the frame from outside the viewing window. In the back, the familiar contours of Chiaki\'s bedroom reminded Ryouko of her old life. She had been hoping to catch Chiaki alone, but Ruiko had turned out to be visiting.

\"Don\'t disturb the lovebirds,\" Ruiko said, looking at Chiaki.

Then to Ryouko she said:

\"Hey, when you two get married, are you going to pay for us to fly out and be your bridesmaids? I hear you girls make a lot of Allocs.\"

Chiaki gave Ruiko a look, then shrugged, seeming to relax.

\"They make exceptions to the excise cost for special events,\" Chiaki said. \"Didn\'t you pay attention---\"

\"I dropped that class; it was boring,\" Ruiko interrupted.

\"You\'re hopeless,\" Chiaki said bluntly.

Ryouko smiled slightly, watching her friends\' banter. Next to her, Asami stirred, waking from her nap. The girl insisted on sleeping with her arm around Ryouko---it was a little uncomfortable, but she had gotten used to it. Ryouko, not being as tired as Asami apparently had been, had taken the opportunity to make a phone call---one of the little conveniences of modern implants was the ability to automatically tune out irrelevant sound if one was sleeping, so Ryouko hadn\'t needed to fear waking Asami up.

She felt Asami adjust her arm slightly, causing the blanket to slide over Ryouko\'s skin.

\"Come on, it\'ll be a while before something like that happens,\" Ryouko said, answering Ruiko\'s joke of a question.

\"Really? I don\'t think so,\" Ruiko said, smiling mischievously. Ryouko couldn\'t quite read the expression.

\"Phone call?\" Asami murmured, breath tingling against Ryouko\'s neck.

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko whispered, toggling the mental command that prevented what she said from being transmitted over the call.

\"Is that a video call?\" Asami asked, eyes opening blearily.

\"Yes, of cour---\"

Ryouko\'s eyes widened.

*No, I am* not *this stupid. I did* not *forget how implant‐mediated video calls worked, just because I\'m used to civilian calls.*

She instinctively pulled her sheets further up, so that it covered her neck and Asami\'s arm, triggering a burst of laughter from the other end of the call. Ryouko looked at the virtual video screen, and found Chiaki covering her mouth in mirth, while Ruiko had disappeared off‐screen altogether.

\"We weren\'t sure if it was intentional,\" Ruiko said, through laughter.

\"You could have said something anyway!\" Ryouko said, blushing furiously.

\"Oh, Ryouko‐chan,\" Ruiko said, putting her hand to her forehead and shaking her head in bemusement. \"The best result would have been for us to finish the call without you ever realizing. You make this kind of mistake all the time. Wow.\"

Ryouko\'s cheeks burned, and she could feel Asami watching her.

\"I think I need to go,\" she said lamely.

\"Yes I think you do,\" Chiaki said, still smiling. \"Happy birthday, by the way. Not today, obviously, but just in case I don\'t get to say it tomorrow. I\'ll put in a call request tomorrow, though. Later.\"

As the call ended, Ryouko felt a frisson of mirth emerging from a certain spinal implant she was highly displeased with. These days, Clarisse seemed to derive far too much enjoyment at her expense. She was starting to feel like she needed to get her TacComp a hobby.

But there was a more pressing task.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said to Asami. \"I forgot---\"

\"It\'s okay!\" Asami said, embracing her with both arms, forestalling the apology. She even giggled slightly.

\"Calling your Earth friends?\" Asami asked, rubbing her face into Ryouko\'s neck.

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko said, uncomfortably.

\"I called Meiqing recently. She\'s doing okay. Says she lost a leg on Apollo but no big deal. She wants you to call her.\"

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko repeated. \"You know my mom is still here, right? In the next room?\"

\"Oh, I know,\" Asami said. \"We might have to get used to it. You know, your mom is thinking about staying.\"

Ryouko turned her head to peer at Asami in surprise.

\"Really? She hasn\'t mentioned it to me.\"

\"Well, she\'s just thinking about it. She wants you to get it sorted how long you\'re staying, and then apparently her boss will let her switch work locations for a while. It\'s a good chance. She would have difficulty transferring off of Earth otherwise, with the restrictions.\"

Ryouko made a face. Truth be told, she had gotten a bit used to living on her own. Having her mom living with them would be---

\"I know,\" Asami said appeasingly. \"I\'m just telling you she\'s thinking about it. It\'s a legitimate option. She doesn\'t intend to play the dating game right now, and you *are* her only daughter. She might get her own place.\"

Ryouko sighed, looking down at the bottom of the bed.

\"I\'ll talk to her about it.\"

\"Anyway,\" Asami said, grabbing opportunistically at her. \"What I\'m saying is---\"

\"We don\'t have time,\" Ryouko pointed out immediately. \"It\'s time for us to go to the lab.\"

\"Oh, right,\" Asami said, checking her chronometer. \"You\'re right, we should get going.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She found her mother seated in the sitting room---an actual room, just for sitting around in!---frowning at a sheet of paper in her hands. It piqued Ryouko\'s interest immediately, given how rare paper was, but as they emerged from the hallway, her mother folded it and placed it into the pocket of her pants.

\"I trust you two enjoyed your nap?\" she asked, before Ryouko could say anything.

\"Oh, yes,\" Asami responded.

\"Good. I suppose it feels natural for you two, taking a nap in the early morning. Eventually, you\'ll lose that circadian tendency, but it might take a while. I\'ll make you two some breakfast. Eggs are easy, though I\'d really rather not think about where they come from.\"

Her mother spoke quickly, not allowing a word in edgewise, and got up to head to the kitchen. Ryouko saw Asami\'s face scrunch slightly at the odd phraseology of \"circadian tendency\".

Ryouko walked forward, shifting her location so that she could see over the breakfast counter into the kitchen. She wanted to ask about the sheet of paper, but...

\"Asami says you\'re thinking about moving to Eurydome, mama,\" she said, leaning onto the counter.

\"I\'m thinking about it, yes,\" her mother said, back to Ryouko, facing the stove. \"It makes a lot of sense. My parents aren\'t on Earth anymore and you\'re my only daughter. Career‐wise, it\'d be hard to give up my current position at Prometheus, but the institute does have some offshoots here.\"

Her mother turned to look at her with one eye.

\"Of course, the Earth thing to do would be to move in here, but since this is the colonies, it wouldn\'t be hard to get a different place. I wouldn\'t really mind too much either way. Give me an opinion.\"

Her mother turned back toward the stove.

\"I wonder how you\'re supposed to get the white to phase change but the yolk part to stay liquid. It\'s not really working out like I expected.\"

Ryouko sighed. She should have thought about this more before bringing it up. She didn\'t know yet what she wanted.

\"I don\'t know, mama,\" she said, as honest as she felt she could be. "You\'re still on vacation for two more weeks, so let\'s see how it works out. Do you want to stay here?\"

\"Well, if I do stay here, we\'re going to have to get them to install new soundproofing on your room. And you know, if this turns out to be a long‐term deal, I can eventually do the cliché thing and start pressuring you for grandkids.\"

\"Mama!\"

\"I\'m kidding. But seriously about the soundproofing. Oh, the internet says to add a bit of water. I guess that makes sense. Will carry heat to the surface and... the proteins in the egg are too hydrophobic to mix with water? That would make sense. Should I cover it?\"

Ryouko scowled, even though her mother couldn\'t see. She knew her mother was talking to fill the empty space, and inhibit Ryouko from talking about something.

\"Mama, what was on the sheet of paper?\"

Her mother glanced back, then pulled the folded scrap of paper out of her pocket.

\"My sister is visiting,\" her mother said, still tending her eggs. "She said she\'s bringing company, and she wants to talk to you. Alone, without me or Asami‐chan. I\'ve already told the physics lab you two will be late. I guess this will be a good chance for Asami to show me around the university?\"

She regarded the piece of paper in her hand for a moment, then shoved it into the feed hole on the side of the synthesizer she had brought from Earth. The synthesizer would break the paper down into composite parts, which it would then either store or recycle to a central distribution point.

\"I was supposed to destroy it,\" she said, shrugging.

Her mother poked at the eggs with a spatula, trying to lift them off the surface onto a plate.

\"Ah, nee‐chan, if only Akemi‐san hadn\'t pulled you into a career like that. I wonder---\"

Her mother paused for a moment, spatula with egg in midair, then finished the motion, without the finishing the sentence.

\"Akemi as in Akemi Homura?\" Asami asked, with surprising intuition, looking at Ryouko. \"You have an aunt who knew her?\"

\"Yes,\" she said, as blandly as she could, as internally she traced out the same line of thought her mother assuredly was. Akemi Homura had chosen to mentor Kuroi Nana, though the memory Ryouko had received had not clarified exactly why. If Homura had truly believed that there was a familial connection between her Goddess and their family, then that would be a compelling reason for her interest in Nana. Such a conclusion could be reached based solely on the contents of the memory from her grandmother, even if one didn\'t believe in the Goddess at all---and Ryouko\'s mother had certainly viewed the recording Ryouko gave her, even if she had not yet elected to say anything about it.

\"Though it\'s not very easy to find out I even *have* a sister, going by the public records,\" her mother said, turning to place two plates of food in front of them. \"We\'re that kind of family, apparently.\"

Ryouko looked down at her two eggs. The yolk of one had ruptured, leaking orange‐yellow liquid onto the piece of bread her mother had thoughtfully placed underneath, probably following internet guidance.

Her mother looked at her and shrugged apologetically.

\"I wonder if your aunt knows,\" she said.

\"If she does, she didn\'t tell me,\" Ryouko said. \"I hardly know her, after all.\"

She let her voice develop a tinge of snark, to let her mother know she was still unhappy about that.

\"It couldn\'t be avoided,\" her mother said breezily. \"It certainly might be a good idea to tell her, don\'t you think?\"

\"Probably,\" Ryouko agreed. \"Do you know why she\'s here?\"

\"No, she didn\'t say anything specific. It must be sensitive, if she\'s excluding her own family.\"

Ryouko let the exchange lapse into silence. Asami had developed that unhappy look she got when forced to listen to a deliberately cryptic conversation, an occurrence that was starting to become too often nowadays. Ryouko would hear the displeasure later, she was certain.

\"Asami, I don\'t really know what this is about either, but the work my aunt does is highly secret. Even if I did know what was going on, I wouldn\'t be allowed to tell you. She doesn\'t even want to tell her own sister! Think about it.\"

She was only tangentially addressing the issue, she knew. It wasn\'t as if Asami were being unreasonable about classified material---the problem was with the secret information Ryouko and her mother obviously shared.

She knew, too, that Asami wouldn\'t be distracted by an irrelevant explanation like that, but the girl still allowed herself to be mollified, expression softening. She was glad for that---Asami could be surprisingly understanding sometimes. There were a lot of secrets in Ryouko\'s life, and she simply wasn\'t ready to share them with Asami yet.

\"Well, I guess I can show your mom around the school,\" Asami said. "Though I\'m not sure there\'s that much to see. When do you think we should leave?\"

\"I don\'t want to leave until she arrives,\" Ryouko\'s mother said, shaking her head. \"I don\'t see my sister very often and she said she had no problems with me staying around. I---\"

She was interrupted by a sharp knocking noise, coming from the direction of the front door. They turned to look at it with faint surprise, faces blank.

It was Ryouko\'s mother who responded first, signaling the door to slide open for the person on the other side.

Kuroi Nana peered in at them, flanked on one side by none other than Sakura Kyouko, founder and leader of the Church of Hope, who seemed to be working her way through a stick of beef jerky.

\"Kyouko‐san!\" Ryouko exclaimed, almost involuntarily.

\"Nee‐chan,\" her mother echoed, more calmly.

\"I\'m sorry about the door thing,\" Nana explained. \"If I\'m going to conceal my movements, it\'s best if I leave as few traces as possible, so I couldn\'t tell the door I was there.\"

Ryouko\'s aunt and mother exchanged a brief unreadable look, and then Ryouko found herself looking on as the two siblings hugged.

*She looks like* your *sister, rather than your mom\'s sister,* Asami thought, glancing at Ryouko.

*I guess,* Ryouko thought, trying to spot the resemblance.

She turned towards Kyouko.

\"You\'ll find out soon enough,\" Kyouko said, smiling crookedly as she intercepted Ryouko\'s question before she could ask it, biting off another piece of jerky.

Next to them, the two sisters parted their embrace, holding hands for a brief moment. Ryouko wondered briefly what it was like to have a sibling so close in age. She supposed she would never find out.

\"Come on, Asami‐chan,\" her mother said. \"Let\'s go.\"

There was a brief awkward shuffle of bodies as Kyouko stepped forward, Ryouko and Nana stepped to the side, and the remaining two angled forward, the whole maneuver far more complicated than necessary.

Finally, Nakase and Asami stood on the threshold, looking back for a moment.

\"See you later,\" they said, almost simultaneously.

*If they\'re here to try to get you to go somewhere, just---well we can talk about it later,* Asami thought.

Then the door slid closed, and they were gone.

Ryouko stood uncomfortably for a moment, feeling Nana and Kyouko watching her.

\"Come in,\" she said, finally remembering that it was *her* apartment, and according to the system of social niceties, she was host.

She gestured vaguely at the multiple cushy couches arranged in a circle in the sitting room, feeling a pang of embarrassment at the decor scheme Asami had chosen. She hoped it wasn\'t giving them the wrong impression about her.

\"Want me to get some snacks, or tea?\" she asked, as the two of them sat down. It felt very strange to her.

Her two \"guests\" signaled with hand gestures that they were fine, Kyouko pointing to the snack she already had, so Ryouko stepped past Kyouko and sat down on the couch against the wall. She faced them both across the table, Nana directly in front and Kyouko to the left. They watched her and she watched them.

She sighed, realizing that they were waiting for her to say something.

\"So, I guess I might as well be direct about it,\" she said. \"What is this about?\"

The other two girls smiled slightly in response.

\"Is your privacy field thing up and running?\" Kyouko asked, looking at Nana.

\"It\'s always on, except when it isn\'t,\" Nana said, glancing back in response.

She turned her head back to look at Ryouko.

\"I guess I\'ll go first,\" she said. \"Sakura‐san here can give her spiel afterward. Believe it or not, the topic is the same.\"

\"I can\'t imagine how,\" Ryouko said, quite honestly.

\"Well, let me try to explain this as correctly as possible,\" Nana said, voice smooth and urbane. \"I\'ve heard about your little assignment here, the arrangement with the Prometheus Institute and MSY Finance. Quite frankly, you\'re being railroaded a bit, as I\'m sure you\'ve realized. I can understand how such a thing might feel, so one of the reasons we\'re here is to present you with a bit of a different option. Simply put, I\'ve discussed the matter with our friendly family Matriarch, and we\'re happy to try and find you a suitable arrangement in the intelligence services instead.\"

Nana paused a moment to assess Ryouko\'s reaction, observing the wheels starting to turn in her head. Then she continued:

\"This would not have to be to the exclusion of the life you\'re building here, or the work you\'re doing---among other things, to pull you completely out of wormhole research would be doing a grave disservice to the war effort and Humanity as a whole. Indeed, were it not for certain extenuating circumstances, we would have left you alone here for at least another couple of months, at least long enough for the scientists here to get a good idea of whether they would need you for another few years, or whether what they already had was enough.\"

Nana paused again, and this time she watched Ryouko for longer. Ryouko had her head bowed downward, parsing the densely‐packed meaning of what Nana had said, even having Clarisse playing back parts of the message a few times.

\"Extenuating circumstances?\" Ryouko asked, looking back up at Nana.

\"Well, to phrase it simply, there is a mission on hand that Kyouko and I think would be useful to have you on.\"

Nana and Kyouko shared a look, seeming to reach some sort of shared decision.

\"You recall how I told you once that I was part of a team looking for Akemi Homura?\" Nana asked.

Ryouko nodded, slowly.

\"You\'ll recall that for a while after her alleged disappearance, we were able to find traces of her passage in various locations, but that eventually this trail ran out. There has been a recent development which leads us to believe that the trail may not be as cold as we think.\"

Another glance from Nana to Kyouko, and then Nana made eye contact with Ryouko, gaze turning a little soft.

\"It\'s not that I don\'t trust you, Ryouko‐chan, but I\'ve generally found that it\'s better not to tell people who don\'t need to know, for all sorts of reasons. If you don\'t agree to join the mission, I don\'t think you need to know.\"

\"Personally, I think she\'s being too paranoid,\" Kyouko said, peering at her with one eye. \"But it\'s her show, so I\'ll do what she says.\"

Nana looked at Kyouko, then back at Ryouko.

\"I don\'t see why you\'re here talking to me,\" Ryouko said, wondering if she was missing something obvious. \"Is there a need for a long teleport?\"

Another glance between Kyouko and Nana, and Ryouko was sure now: they were holding some kind of telepathic conversation, though not bothering to hide it from her.

\"Well, not quite,\" Nana said.

\"The Goddess has taken a special interest in you, Ryouko,\" Kyouko said, giving Ryouko a meaningful look. \"I don\'t think all this is a coincidence, and I don\'t think she means for you to live quietly here working with wormholes.\"

Ryouko instinctively glanced at Nana, and found her watching Ryouko impassively. It didn\'t seem like Nana was shocked or repulsed by the goddess‐speak.

She swallowed her qualms and said out loud what she never had before.

\"The last time I asked her about my life, she said she wanted me to live my own life, and wouldn\'t give me any direction. At the same time, I got the impression she wasn\'t done with me. I can\'t say I really know what to think now, about what the Goddess wants or doesn\'t want me to do.\"

She peered back into Kyouko\'s eyes, but instead of the searing look of inspection she had expected, the girls eyes were soft, full of understanding somehow.

\"Homura was my mentor for a good part of my life,\" Nana said. \"It would have been impossible for me to work with her for so long, and not learn about her connection to her Goddess. Whatever the truth of the matter is, if we are indeed digging in the right place, she may find it hard to resist contacting you.\"

\"I\'m basically bait?\" Ryouko asked, cringing immediately at how blunt she sounded.

\"I wouldn\'t think of it that way,\" Kyouko said. \"I\'m going to try and convince Mami to let me go too. The Church is interested in anything involving Homura.\"

Kyouko nodded approvingly at herself, and Ryouko realized that she wasn\'t looking at a well‐reasoned decision, but the product of some kind of faith. It felt odd to her, since even her direct interactions with the divine were heavily tinged with practicality.

Nana cleared her throat slightly to get her attention.

\"Besides my section of Internal Security, the... Church of Hope is the only group conducting a serious search for Akemi Homura. We\'ve had contacts for a long time, and sometimes shared information, though I can\'t say I\'ve really spoken with Sakura‐san much before this. Calling her in on this is something that I owe to the Church, and having an Ancient on a mission always helps.\"

Kyouko coughed slightly at Nana\'s use of \"Ancient\", but didn\'t say anything.

\"There\'s also...\" Nana continued, before pausing for a moment, looking down at the table. Kyouko looked at her and nodded, slowly.

Nana shook her head.

\"Later, perhaps. But that\'s more or less the gist of it. And, the fact is, I am aware how important wormhole research can be. One option is simply for you to join the mission, and then come back. The offer from Kana‐san to join the intelligence services is a bit more open‐ended.\"

Ryouko looked from Nana to Kyouko, and back again. She didn\'t know what to say. She had been feeling uneasy about staying here, on Eurydome, but she had not done anything about it, nor spoken to Asami. Did she really want to leave, even temporarily, for something like this?

\"How long do I have to decide?\" Ryouko asked.

\"About a week,\" Nana said. \"I\'m sorry, but we\'re on a tight schedule.\"

Ryouko looked down at her hands. So this was how it was going to be, it seemed. At least she was being given a choice this time, she supposed.

A message from Clarisse entered her thoughts---a question Clarisse wanted her to ask, and it was a good question indeed.

\"You mentioned Mami was somehow in control of the mission?\" Ryouko said, looking up abruptly at Kyouko. \"How is she involved?\"

Kyouko looked bemused for a moment, scratching at her cheek with one finger.

\"Well, nominally the mission is under her control,\" Kyouko said. \"I actually haven\'t talked to her about going, but I\'m sure she\'ll be accommodating.\"

Kyouko didn\'t sound as sure as she claimed, but Ryouko let the topic drop.

\"I don\'t think I can decide on the spot,\" she said. \"Is there a, uh, way I can contact you?\"

It wasn\'t usually a question worth asking, but Kuroi Nana could, and probably would, disappear into the mist the moment the meeting ended.

\"You can just tell Kyouko,\" Nana said, nodding. \"I can\'t say it\'s surprising you need to think about it. Any more questions?\"

Ryouko thought for a moment and shook her head slowly, reluctantly. Nana watched her for a moment longer, then stood up.

\"Well, I\'m sorry I can\'t stay longer. I might come visiting again, for more of a family thing, but I have too much to do. Give my regards to your mother. Oh, and, uh, sorry for missing your birthday. I wanted to come tomorrow, but the timing didn\'t work out.\"

Ryouko started to get up to show Nana out, but then looked at Kyouko, who wasn\'t moving, and suddenly an obvious question occurred to her.

\"I\'m sorry if this seems rude, but... well, why are you here? You traveled from Earth just to see me? Do you have something to ask too?\"

Kyouko looked at her and grinned broadly, row of gleaming teeth glistening.

Kyouko placed the last part of her beef jerky in her mouth.

\"Well, I\'m here to check up on my favorite trainee, since she\'s about to have a birthday. Why don\'t you show me around?\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko didn\'t really believe that Kyouko was here just to check up on her, but the Ancient was, in fact, her mentor, so there was little she could dispute. As Kyouko ended up pointing out repeatedly, she hadn\'t really done much for Ryouko since sending her to training---and implicitly, Mami\'s care.

So, after sending Nana the memory file she had received from her grandmother, she checked her internal chronometer, sighed, and decided it couldn\'t hurt to bring Kyouko with her to the lab. Something about the Cult leader\'s almost predatory smile unnerved her, however.

It was only a short while later that Ryouko found herself on her way to the University of Thalia, located in the eponymous city. It was the largest of Eurydome\'s cities; that was to say, still small by Earth standards. MSY Finance had been kind enough to provide Ryouko with her own private vehicle, which weaved its way through Thalia\'s streets as she pondered her situation silently.

\"You asked me a while ago about a vision you had,\" Kyouko said, getting her attention by looking in her direction. \"One with Yuma, and Oriko.\"

\"Yes,\" Ryouko acknowledged, looking back at Kyouko and wondering what had prompted this topic.

\"Do you want to talk about it?\" Kyouko asked. \"I admit---I\'d like to hear more about it.\"

Ryouko peered into Kyouko\'s quiet, thoughtful eyes, and tried to read the Ancient; not something that was likely to work, but she had to try anyway. Kyouko had all sorts of reasons to want to know about visions from the Goddess, but Ryouko could easily imagine that the topic was also important for other reasons.

\"Well, it wasn\'t a very long vision,\" Ryouko said, shading her eyes downward. \"It looked like Oriko had just died, and Yuma was crying over her. What bothered me was that... well, Yuma looked like she was on the verge of soul gem breakdown, and then she attacked a group of demons. I don\'t know how to say this, but it doesn\'t match the official story, and it was part of a vision...\"

She let her voice trail off, risking a glance at Kyouko\'s face to gauge her reaction. Kyouko did not look terribly annoyed or bothered, or even skeptical. Instead she maintained the same calm, matronly expression as before. Ryouko suspected it revealed very little about Kyouko\'s true thoughts.

\"Well,\" Kyouko said, clasping her hands together. \"That is because the official story simply isn\'t true.\"

Kyouko paused, watching Ryouko\'s reaction, and Ryouko found herself blinking, waiting for Kyouko to continue.

\"Perhaps you can get Yuma herself to tell you, someday,\" Kyouko said, before Ryouko could ask. \"I admit that sounds rather far‐fetched, but if you got a vision about it, then it would certainly make sense for you eventually to learn all the necessary context---\"

Kyouko paused dramatically, raising a finger.

\"---but I can\'t be the one to tell you about it. I know that sounds unfair, since I just asked you to tell me about your vision, but it\'s really her story to tell. I needed to check just how much you knew. Sorry.\"

She paused, putting her hand to her mouth.

\"I wonder, though, just how much Oriko saw of the future. Even Yuma never really got a full idea.\"

Kyouko looked pointedly away, making it clear that Ryouko wasn\'t intended to ask about what Kyouko had just said. As Ryouko began to ponder whether to ask anyway, Kyouko started digging through her clothing, obviously searching for some thing.

She quickly gave up, though, then sighed loudly.

\"I miss Mami\'s swank car,\" Kyouko said. \"It makes tea and snacks for you. But I guess that\'s asking too much. I should have brought more food.\"

\"Car?\" Ryouko asked, tilting her head slightly. \"You want cookies?\"

\"Nevermind,\" Kyouko said, waving off the question. \"We\'re almost there, anyway.\"

Indeed they were---the organization of the buildings around them had gradually transitioned into the highly‐networked structure that typified modern research clusters. The sky above them was filled with skybridges and workspaces, at a density that would have been unusual even for Earth. Ryouko often wondered why the University didn\'t simply shift the road they were traveling on underground, and replace the aboveground with one monolithic structure. Too much retrofitting, perhaps.

The vehicle pulled up to the curb next to a particularly ornate structure, tall even by the standards of the University. This entrance was only a side entrance, intended for staff rather than visitors, but the top of the door was still carved with a symbol that resembled a many‐pointed star, evocative of the sun, of particles colliding, or perhaps even of black holes. It was tough to say, really.

Ryouko stood on the threshold for a long moment, staring at the symbol and thinking. Asami had already sent her a message informing her that she and her mother had arrived at the lab, so it really wouldn\'t do for Ryouko to be any later than she already was. And yet, Ryouko found herself strangely reluctant to enter the building. She didn\'t want to see the scientists, because she didn\'t want to be reminded that she would be letting them down if she left on a mission, taking the risk of getting herself killed. Childish, maybe, to want to avoid making a decision that displeased people she knew, but even after everything she had seen and done, she still felt like a child sometimes.

She could feel Kyouko\'s gaze upon her, so she turned to ask:

\"Does it ever go away?\"

\"What?\" Kyouko asked, as Ryouko knew she would.

\"That feeling of not really knowing what you\'re doing. I feel like I have so much responsibility, but then I remember people like Mami‐san, who have so much more. I\'m really just a child, aren\'t I?\"

Kyouko tilted her head, the gesture indicating her surprise at Ryouko\'s sudden choice of topic, emotional as it was.

She smiled slightly, crookedly, and for a moment Ryouko felt she saw a glimmer of something authentic in Kyouko\'s eyes.

\"The feeling never goes away,\" she said, putting her hand on Ryouko\'s shoulder. \"Not even for us. Not even for Mami.\"

Kyouko paused slightly, just for a moment.

\"You\'ll be fine,\" she said. \"We wouldn\'t have sprung this on you so early, but there wasn\'t really a choice. We can talk more later. Come on.\"

Ryouko allowed herself to be led through the doorway, the building\'s authentication sensors automatically granting her, and by extension Kyouko, passage.

Ryouko frowned, watching Kyouko\'s back as she walked. There was something she needed to tell Kyouko, now that she was here. It was not really something she wanted to talk about, but---

She startled slightly, stopping just in time to avoid running into Kyouko. The girl had paused just inside a large atrium, looking around the room with a thoughtful expression, then turning to peer at Ryouko questioningly.

It took Ryouko a moment to pick up the obvious: Kyouko had no idea where they were going. As a partially‐secured facility, the Institute for Theoretical Gravitonics---ITG---gave visitors only an incomplete map. Even if Kyouko had taken the time to look up which lab Ryouko was affiliated with, it wouldn\'t have availed her much.

\"This way,\" Ryouko said, leading Kyouko towards the other side of the atrium, past a few scattered researchers seated in front of \"Event Horizon Brewing\", a gourmet coffee shop that seemed to really enjoy making terrible puns between \"black coffee\" and \"black hole\".

They walked for a while into the depths of the building, threading up ramps, down twisting hallways, and past a bevy of doorways inscribed with the ITG logo. Unlike Prometheus on Earth, which had a relatively straightforward, grid‐like layout, ITG\'s main building had been designed by a rather eccentric AI architect. According to legend, the AI, a bit of a physics enthusiast, had been shown a few cross‐sections of a Calabi‐Yau manifold, and had been so inspired that it had spent a solid month designing a building layout that could house working research labs and particle accelerators, fulfill all safety and usability requirements, and whose layout would map meaningfully to a full Calabi‐Yau manifold.

The practical result had been a building that was impossible to navigate without the full internal map, and had gotten so many visitors lost going to the bathroom that special robotic escorts had been installed. The running joke was that with its blasphemous angles, the building was only waiting for the stars to be right to awaken into its true form---a joke that the building AI took in surprisingly good humor, though it had been forced to abandon using a Cthulhu avatar after a returning veteran panicked and tried to attack it.

They came to a stop outside an elevator with circular doors. Typically, the elevator was busy elsewhere. It was an annoyance compared to Earth.

\"Why are the floors on this elevator labeled with two numbers?\" Kyouko asked.

\"It runs diagonally,\" Ryouko explained. \"Don\'t ask.\"

\"Diagonally...\" Kyouko echoed.

But she didn\'t ask.

Ryouko let out a breath as they stepped into the elevator car. She supposed she didn\'t have to talk to Kyouko about the vision until later.

*Ryouko...* Clarisse warned, the nagging tone of her voice rubbing abrasively inside her head.

*Fine, fine,* she thought.

Her TacComp had been on her case recently about her \"procrastinatory habits\".

\"Kyouko,\" she began, hesitating as always on dropping the honorific as Kyouko preferred.

\"Hmm?\" Kyouko asked, tilting her head towards Ryouko.

\"I\'m not sure this is the right time to bring this up,\" Ryouko said, as they began to descend into the subterranean levels of the building, "but do you remember the first vision I had, the one where it looked like you had been killed?\"

\"Of course,\" Kyouko said. \"Why?\"

\"I\'ve been thinking about it,\" Ryouko said. \"And looking back at it now, I don\'t think we were fighting aliens in the vision. The weapon types used don\'t match. I just thought you should know.\"

Kyouko closed her eyes for a moment, bowing her head slightly.

\"That\'s interesting to hear,\" she said. \"I\'ve thought about it too. When your aunt came to talk to me, I thought about just sending someone, instead of going myself. But, you know, I didn\'t want to stay on Earth just because I was scared. If that\'s what the Goddess wanted, I think she would have been more clear about it.\"

\"Is she usually more clear?\" Ryouko asked.

Kyouko closed her eyes again.

\"In a way. Sometimes I visit the Ribbon, and she\'ll talk to me, just her voice. I\'ve only rarely gotten a vision more elaborate than that. I\'m a bit jealous of people like you.\"

Kyouko opened her eyes again, and looked at Ryouko.

\"Something bothers me about all this. Your vision implies that someone is going to try and kill me. Someone might have already tried to kill you. I can\'t help but think it\'s all connected, somehow. But it doesn\'t make sense.\"

\"Have you figured out who it was?\" Ryouko asked, voice quiet. She had almost forgotten about it, and it disturbed her to think about.

\"We haven\'t learned a damn thing,\" Kyouko said, voice tinged with a hint of anger.

Kyouko\'s forehead wrinkled in frustration for a moment.

\"Well, the Goddess will take care of things. I try not to worry too much about this kind of thing. Even if I die, things will work out. It\'s not like I haven\'t lived enough.\"

The elevator settled into a gentle stop, and the doors slid open. They stood there for a moment, and then Ryouko led the way out.

\"Just how deep underground are we, anyway?\" Kyouko asked.

\"Not very deep, compared to a redoubt,\" Ryouko said, \"but pretty deep compared to anything else. Apparently all the really delicate stuff gets done down here.\"

Ryouko felt a vague glimmer of satisfaction as they strode down the hallway, Kyouko turning her head to and fro to peer down side corridors. For once, Ryouko wasn\'t the one being shown around, the gawker standing out like a sore thumb among a crowd of veterans.

\"Are you sure you can even let me down here?\" Kyouko asked, *sotto voce*.

\"It\'s fine, as long as I\'m not showing you anything too secret,\" Ryouko said. \"Which I\'m not. I brought my mom here, after all.\"

\"Yeah, but she\'s a scientist, I guess.\"

The deep subterranean levels, constrained by the large‐scale equipment installed around them---particle accelerators, artificial gravity generators, and the like---had a more conventional floor plan, coupled with a high ceiling and bright, cheery lighting, designed to dispel any claustrophobia that might have resulted from the long elevator trip down. Solid stone squares, as tall as the doors, were set into the wall at regular intervals, chiseled with abstract symbols and drawings of astronomical phenomena. It was a bit of an odd design aesthetic, but Ryouko had gotten used to that in the weeks that she had spent here.

Finally, they arrived at their destination, identified by a small sign labeled \"Very High Energy Studies ‐ Director: Tao Shaojie\". Ryouko had learned to identify when she was almost there by watching for the stone tile inscribed with what appeared to be rippling water.

The door slid open at their approach, revealing immediately the most striking feature of the room: the giant metallic tubes, thicker than Ryouko was tall, some of which passed right by the entrance. The room was evidently enormous, more of a warehouse than a room---as could be seen by peering past the tubing into the far back corners---but was filled nearly to the brim with desks, measurement equipment attached to the tubes, and research personnel.

Dr. Tao himself was waiting a few steps in, eagerness barely concealed.

\"Oh, so this is the other visitor?\" he asked, tilting his head. "Well, I\'m afraid the tour will have to wait. We are keen to begin, and I am sure seeing the lab in action will be far more interesting than looking at inactive equipment.\"

Ryouko allowed them to be led deeper into the room, accumulating as they went a small crowd of scientists. Ryouko had memorized some of their identities over the past few weeks, at least vaguely, and could identify the senior researchers, the research students, and the students from the local high school, including the boy who Asami claimed was always giving Ryouko \"The Look\", though Ryouko didn\'t believe it.

They found Ryouko\'s mother standing in the observation room, peering through a thick pane of reinforced glass down at the study area, where Asami was performing various gravitational feats for the benefit of the facility\'s gravitational sensors.

\"Greetings,\" the laboratory AI, Lemaître, said, as their small group entered the observation room. Rather than choosing to resemble his namesake, the AI used a nondescript, rather short avatar, which stood next to Ryouko\'s mother, hands clasped behind its back, in front of an elaborate control that it surely was not manipulating manually.

\"Should we wait until Nakihara‐san is finished?\" Dr. Tao asked.

\"That won\'t be necessary,\" the AI said. \"I was collecting low priority data. Now that Miss Shizuki is here, we can begin the serious experimentation.\"

Ryouko didn\'t really like Lemaître, who she suspected thought of her more as an experimental subject than a person.

But she nodded, then exited alone through a door on the side. As she descended down to the study area, she played back in her mind the proud statements she knew Director Tao would be funneling at Kyouko, how their artificial gravity generator was one of Humanity\'s most powerful, more powerful even than those installed on battlecruisers. The whole underground facility was seismically shielded, the sensors were some of the most precise ever produced, based on his own design, the lab had put together a new human subject study area in only a few weeks, and so on and so forth. Only a very cruel person would have pointed out that Adept Blue, the deep space gravitonics lab situated on an asteroid in the Sol System, had him beat in most of those categories.

Indeed, the interests of pure science would have directed Ryouko there, instead of to this lab on Eurydome.

She met Asami inside the small privacy room that adjoined the study area. The girl was on her way back up, and gave her one of the quick kisses she was so fond of.

*If you spend too long in this room \'transforming\', they\'ll wonder what you two are doing,* Clarisse mocked.

*Shut up,* Ryouko responded.

She transformed and glanced at the monitor above the doorway. \"Gravity Level: 0 g\", it said.

She took a breath, and stepped through the doorway into the study area.

There was really very little for her to think about in these studies, she reflected, as she allowed herself to float into the air. Unlike Asami, who could perform active manipulations and even had a fascinating singularity for the scientists to fawn over, she was a one‐trick pony: she could make a temporary wormhole and pass through it. Thus, while Asami\'s instructions were sometimes quite complex, Ryouko\'s usually consisted of \"teleport from point A to point B and back over and over while we adjust the gravitational field.\"

She had been afraid that Asami would end up stealing her thunder in the eyes of the scientists, but that had turned out not to be the case. The scientists seemed endlessly fascinated by the streams of data coming from their sensors, and hadn\'t begun to show even the slightest sign of apathy about her presence.

The experiments had even been a little educational for Ryouko herself, she had to admit. She had learned, for example, why a long string attached to one of her arbalest\'s bolts would snap when she teleported, like during her very first demon hunt. It came down to the physics of the wormholes she used to teleport: she could only manipulate the geometry of her wormhole\'s mouth so much, and only hold it open for so long. That meant she couldn\'t force something distant through it, whether it was connected to her or not.

She did plan to work on her wormhole control, however.

This week\'s experimental protocol tasked her with teleporting through a predefined series of points as fast as she could, until she felt she couldn\'t anymore. She had a restriction on how frequently she could teleport that was independent of soul gem, and Dr. Tao believed that this was due to the fundamentals of how her power worked. They wanted to test that as directly as possible, of course.

Ryouko sighed. It wasn\'t exactly pleasant, exhausting her teleports, and she felt faintly ridiculous, teleporting in a circle over and over in a frilly dress, in front of her mother, no less.

\"Are you ready?\" Lemaître asked over an intercom, and she responded by giving a thumbs‐up signal.

The signal light in the room turned green, and Ryouko started her circuit, her perspective shifting from the bottom of the room, to one of the platforms that jutted out of the side, to in the air near the roof, to one of the side walls...

Once, long ago, when she had been newly contracted, the constant changes in perspective would have disoriented her, without the natural magical girl instincts to stabilize her in combat. Now, though, she was used to the process, and quickly started letting Clarisse guide her from location to location, allowing her mind to drift.

A distant part of her mind registered that, according to the indicator sign at the top of the room, the gravitational field had increased to .2 g. She felt surprisingly heavy, and she could also feel that she was starting to draw on her available pool of teleports.

It felt like so long since she had been that quiet, bored Earth girl peering out the window of her room. She had experienced a lot, and learned a lot; of this, she was sure. Yet, as she had implied to Kyouko earlier, she didn\'t feel like she had learned what she really wanted to learn. When she had made her wish, she had imagined that she would be alone, making decisions about her own future, exploring the wide world.

And yet, now that she was finally starting to face this prospect, there was a part of her that found it terrifying. She was facing a choice about whether to leave the planet or not, and she had realized that she was starting to feel a sense of responsibility and with it, a sense of fear at the unknown directions that her decision might take her. Her vision of the possibilities for her future life had expanded, and though she was fairly certain she didn\'t want to be spending too long running teleportation laps around a room, she had started to muse on the idea of bringing Asami with her as she traveled, if Asami would have it.

But would she?

The gravitational field was starting to become very noticeable now---Ryouko was beginning to fall a substantial distance whenever she teleported into the air, despite it being only 0.4 g. Still, she was used to it. She shook her head at herself a little, and tried to go back to her thoughts and forget that she was starting to drain her remaining teleports, a condition that made her nervous on an instinctual level.

Her mother had asked for her opinion on whether Ryouko wanted her to move to Eurydome, but Ryouko could see what she meant: her mother wanted Ryouko to *choose* whether or not she wanted her mother in the area. There was a part of her that was disturbed by the idea of moving back in with her mother so soon after leaving---and yet she felt acutely aware that she was only fourteen, even if she was turning fifteen tomorrow. There were very few fourteen‐year‐olds being asked to make such life decisions---even the contracted ones were mostly being shuffled around the front lines or in and out of training centers. It would be only normal to live with her mother. She would be someone Ryouko could ask for advice.

Nor was her decision as simple as choosing to leave or not leave the planet. There were other options lurking at the edges. Nana had given the option of going on the mission and then simply coming back. That was the safest route, perhaps, but Ryouko did not want to tell Asami and the scientists she would be coming back, when she might not be.

Finally, there was the Goddess lurking in the background. The deity had a plan for her, and she doubted the plan involved her living quietly on Eurydome. Yet the deity had implied she could see the future, and was perhaps even timeless. Ryouko could imagine that she might not be called upon again for years, or even decades. She doubted that, though.

She teleported into the air once again, and this time found herself pulled down so sharply it shocked her. Her soul gem was doing fine, but she could sense that she was nearly out of further ability to teleport. She exerted herself for one final teleport, landing onto a platform on the far side of the room. Teleporting didn\'t remove her velocity relative to the room, though, so the shock in her bones startled her as she landed. That was not typical for such a short fall, and for *her* to feel it, through both her magical girl body and the augmentations, meant that the gravity must have been strong indeed.

\"*I\'m out of teleports,*\" she transmitted to the research team. "*What is the current gravity setting?*\"

She had glanced up at the informational display at the far top corner of the room. It claimed \"0.75 g\", but she had difficulty believing that.

\"*We\'re getting great data, Miss Shizuki,*\" Tao transmitted back. "*Very interesting. I think I may understand---well, we can start again when you\'re ready. The gravity setting is 0.75 g, although that last fall---*\"

Ryouko shook her head.

\"*This is* not *0.75 Earth gravity,*\" she insisted. \"*You saw how fast I fell? I can* feel *it!*\"

From her vantage point on the elevated platform, Ryouko could see nearly the entire room around her: the sterile‐white walls and floor, the gray metal platforms that were identical on both top and bottom, sticking from the sides of the room, the ceiling, and the floor. In one of the top corners she could see the clear reinforced glass---actually a nanofabricated metamaterial---through which the researchers peered down at her. She could see Director Tao turn and gesture at one of the researchers near him, seated at the instrument panel. Asami was probably somewhere else in the facility resting, she realized.

\"*You\'re right,*\" he transmitted back. \"*Something is wrong. Georges, shut down the system. Miss Shizuki, I apologize for this. We\'ll have it sorted out immediately.*\"

Ryouko gritted her teeth, dropping into a crouch. The gravity seemed to be getting worse, and it was becoming difficult to---

*Ryouko! Get out of there! Teleport!*

Asami\'s thought sent a jolt of fear through her heart. She strained, trying to call up the necessary teleport out of the room.

*I can\'t!* she thought. *I ran out! I need fifteen seconds---*

The platform below her started to bend downward, and for a moment she saw the world in slow motion---Director Tao gesticulating wildly at the researcher next to him, the two of them shouting at each other, the door sliding open as Kyouko and Asami rushed in, already transformed.

Then with a tremendous crack, the ceiling above her ruptured open, imploding down upon her impossibly fast, and Ryouko knew that she couldn\'t dodge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Ryouko opened her eyes again, realizing that she had *not* been entombed by countless tons of falling metal and soil, she found herself squinting up at a metallic diamond mesh, shimmering luminescent red, that somehow held up the collapsing ceiling despite its repeating pattern of holes. Around her stood a circle of red apparitions, clones of Kyouko, hands held up toward the sky.

\"What are you waiting for?\" Kyouko asked, her chorus of voices assailing Ryouko from all sides. \"I can\'t keep this up much longer! Teleport to Asami!\"

Ryouko propped herself up onto her arms, regaining her bearings. She had fallen down to the floor under the influence of the intense gravity, but had somehow managed to remain uninjured. She recalled falling into something surprisingly soft and pliable. Had it been Kyouko somehow?

But even as she speculated about what had happened, she dug within herself, trying to pull together the resources to teleport out, fixating on the signature of Asami\'s soul gem. She felt it fluctuate a little---but she couldn\'t worry about that, not yet.

\"Grab my hand so I can teleport you out!\" she shouted, reaching out her arm blindly, unsure which Kyouko was the real Kyouko.

\"These are all clones!\" the Kyoukos said. \"Just go!\"

She teleported.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She arrived at a scene of chaos. The observation room was strewn with rubble, having also apparently suffered some kind of cave‐in, and the door out was visibly bent, clearly in no condition to slide open. The researcher manning the control console was clutching his arm, muttering swear words at himself, but still trying to operate the console. Next to the window, Kyouko had her eyes closed, still channeling her duplicates so that they\'d allow the ceiling of the testing room to collapse in a relatively gentle fashion.

\"Oh, Ry---Miss Shizuki, you\'re okay,\" Dr. Tao said, appearing in front of her. He was holding one hand over his left eye, with blood leaking out visibly behind it, but appeared remarkably dignified for his situation.

Ryouko pushed him aside, though, heading for the first thing she had noticed in the room: Asami kneeling in the corner, Ryouko\'s mother kneeling next to her, whispering into her ear.

The latter stood up at Ryouko\'s approach, turning her head slightly. She seemed reluctant to move for a moment, but then stepped aside, allowing Ryouko to see the source of her reluctance.

In truth, Ryouko had already intuited what had happened from the blood staining her mother\'s pants, but she was only able to fully believe it seeing for herself. Asami knelt on the floor, head down, pinned to the spot by a metal beam straight through the abdomen, blood and gore covering the floor beneath her, her purple costume ripped and torn. Impossibly, she seemed to still be conscious, channeling some kind of magic, her soul gem glowing on the floor in front of her.

In that moment, unable to look away from the sheer trauma that had been inflicted, part of her mind presented her with a flashback of that same abdomen, smooth and unbroken, in an entirely different context---

She instantly regretted the memory, feeling the bile rising in her throat, until it subsided abruptly, Clarisse crushing the emotions with the velvet fist of emotional suppression.

She dropped to her knees next to Asami, searching for the girl\'s eyes. Only then did Asami turn her head to face her.

\"I\'m here,\" she said, blinking away tears. \"I\'m here.\"

*I\'m not very good at keeping my body intact, am I?* Asami thought, as Ryouko realized that the girl didn\'t want to use her mouth to speak. I\'m okay, though, really. I\'ve got pain‐killers and everything from my implants.*

Asami made a pained attempt at a smile, and Ryouko snuck a glance at the girl\'s soul gem, which was on the floor in front of her dumping grief into a small circle of grief cubes. Truth be told, it was doing reasonably well, and Ryouko realized that Asami was telling the truth---she really *was* okay, so long as Ryouko was here.

That only made it more painful.

\"She was trying to save you,\" Kyouko said, appearing next to her. \"We didn\'t think this room would buckle in, too. The only reason we\'re still alive is because she\'s canceling the gravity above us.\"

Ryouko looked up, in time to see Kyouko\'s face soften.

\"She\'ll be fine,\" Kyouko said. \"Take my word for it. I\'ve lived through worse than that myself. Once we get out of here, she can stop using her magic and go into fugue.\"

\"I\'ve lost contact with Geor---Lemaître,\" Dr. Tao said, from behind her. \"But based on the last reports I\'ve heard, something has gone terribly wrong. The gravity generators have gone crazy in the whole complex, and there\'s been collapses everywhere, but at least the emergency stabilizers have gone off and kept the whole place from coming down on us. It\'ll take a while for anyone to get to us, though.\"

Ryouko closed her eyes, taking a deep breath. She---

---found herself jumping up, seizing the Director by the collar and pinning him against the wall. The world turning into a haze around her, as she peered into the man\'s abruptly terrified eyes. She felt herself pressing the man against the wall.

\"What the hell kind of lab are you running here, anyway? What kind of crap do you think you\'re doing, anyway? I didn\'t goddamn---\"

Then an oddly pleasing tingle interrupted her thoughts, as she realized Clarisse had turned up her emotional suppression another notch. She felt a bit numb to the world around her, but at least she could think clearly. She finally noticed Kyouko and her mother pulling at her arms, though only the former had any chance of actually countering the force of her pin.

She released the Director, who had already started having visible difficulty breathing.

\"I\'m sorry about that,\" she said, and even in her own ears her voice sounded empty. \"If it\'s really true that there are still uncollapsed regions of the facility, I could help retrieve them, but...\"

She glanced at Asami, still laboring on the floor, in a pool of her own blood.

\"I\'ll take us all to the surface first,\" she said. \"The emergency workers will have some scanners that can identify where the intact regions of the facility are.\"

She felt Kyouko grab her by the shoulder.

\"It\'s okay,\" Kyouko said. \"I don\'t want you trying to rescue anybody. Go with her to the hospital. I\'m sure there\'ll be other teleporters somewhere in the local area. You don\'t have to be the one to do it.\"

Ryouko turned, looking into Kyouko\'s eyes. Even in her dulled state, she could read what those eyes said. Kyouko wouldn\'t let Ryouko try to stay, even if she wanted to.

\"That seems logical,\" Ryouko responded.

\"When you take us to the surface,\" Dr. Tao said, straightening his collar. \"Make sure to teleport the metal beam along with us. Removing the beam at this point would only add tremendous shock. It has to be done by a trained team.\"

\"That makes sense,\" Ryouko said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She ended up exiting emotional suppression when she was in the hospital, seated in a waiting room as the robotic surgeons did their work. Her mother hovered over her, speaking at length about how it really wouldn\'t be that bad, how they could pull extra organs off her clone in storage, how as a magical girl she could heal it more easily anyway, and so forth. She had considered ending the emotional suppression earlier, but Clarisse had flatly refused.

It wasn\'t as bad as she thought it would be. Her mother held her as she leaned over slightly, trying to contain the nausea that came with exiting suppression. It had been more than half an hour, and there had been enough time for her to calm down. Instead of feeling angry, or despairing, she simply felt numb. She didn\'t like to admit it, but having her mother with her was helpful at that moment in time.

As she leaned on her mother\'s shoulder, she thought about how oddly important Asami had become to her, during their short time on Eurydome. Could it be called love, or was it simply the trauma of seeing another fixture of her life almost torn away? She couldn\'t say.

They sat there until the announcement came that Asami had been moved to one of the hospital beds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was the next day before Asami was allowed to regain consciousness.

\"Hey,\" Ryouko said as Asami\'s eyes opened, holding the girl\'s hand.

Asami seemed to peer at her for a moment, checking for something, then glanced at Ryouko\'s mother behind her.

\"Hey,\" Asami said finally, looking back at Ryouko. \"Happy birthday, I guess. What a great way to spend it, right?\"

Asami smiled slightly, letting Ryouko know it was a joke.

\"Yeah, I guess,\" Ryouko said.

Asami squeezed her hand, and Ryouko looked down at the floor, thinking about something else entirely.

How could she tell her now that she was thinking about leaving with Nana and Kyouko?

\"The doctors say your recovery will take about three days,\" Ryouko said, making eye contact with Asami. \"They brought in a magical healer to accelerate the process, which is why it\'s so fast. The three days is for your body to grow back over the scaffolding they\'ve put in. Your soul gem will help you heal faster.\"

She gestured vaguely at the tubes running out from under Asami\'s sheets. She didn\'t mention the organs they had harvested from Asami\'s new stored clone. Why overcomplicate matters?

Asami looked to the side, spotting her soul gem on the counter next to the bed, draining into a grief cube that her CubeBot was holding with a robotic arm.

\"That\'s good to hear,\" Asami said, smiling slightly. \"We can go out to eat when I\'m back up. For your birthday.\"

\"Right.\"

Ryouko sensed someone behind her, and turned to find Kyouko in the doorway, carrying one of those \"Get Better Soon\" balloons that you always got someone in the hospital. She hadn\'t followed them yesterday, staying behind to help with the rescue efforts. Ryouko suspected that Kyouko had been involved in bringing in a healer for Asami---otherwise, for non‐combat personnel, it was typical to save healing resources by allowing manageable injuries to heal on their own.

\"Chocolates?\" she said, accepting Kyouko\'s gift. \"Well, she\'s actually not supposed to eat for another day, since, well, her stomach...\"

\"Well, tomorrow then,\" Kyouko said, waving her hand dismissively. \"I was going to get something separate for your birthday and all, but this seemed like not the best time for that.\"

Ryouko nodded slightly, acknowledging the point.

\"Well, thanks for visiting,\" Ryouko\'s mother said, gesturing Kyouko towards a chair near Ryouko.

\"To be entirely honest,\" Kyouko said, sitting down and crossing her legs, \"this isn\'t just a visit. Ryouko, Public Order is going to open a foul play investigation into what just happened.\"

There was a moment of silence, and Ryouko saw both Asami and her mother\'s faces twist in confusion.

\"Foul play?\" Ryouko\'s mother asked incredulously.

Kyouko looked down at her hand, which was idly toying with the ribbon attached to the balloon.

\"The circumstances of what happened are apparently very suspicious,\" she said. \"I\'m told there\'ll be some Governance investigators here soon to talk to you about it. They might want your memory files.\"

She made abrupt eye contact with Ryouko, and thought:

*Have you ever told anyone here that there was an attempt on your life when you first contracted? Perhaps we should talk about this in private.*

Ryouko thought about it for a moment.

*I haven\'t. Should I?*

*The rest of what I\'m saying won\'t make sense without it.*

Ryouko glanced at Asami, who was watching their telepathic conversation with a disturbed look, and decided she couldn\'t continue keeping this particular secret.

Ryouko sighed, sliding her chair back so that she could address the others all at once. She looked at Asami and her mother in turn.

\"What Kyouko is getting at is that there\'s something I\'ve never told either of you. The truth is, when I was first making my contract, there was apparently an attempt on my life.\"

Asami\'s face grew even darker, while Ryouko\'s mother gasped audibly.

\"Ryouko! How could you never say---\"

\"We\'ve never found any evidence to indicate who it was, or why they did it,\" Kyouko said, voice clear and serious. \"The truth is, we can\'t even prove they were targeting her specifically. However, and I won\'t go into the details, the reason the investigators want to speak to her so much is that everything thus far seems to indicate that the gravity generators were rigged to cause the most severe collapse into the area we were standing in, once a testing routine was run. That chamber was custom‐built for Ryouko, you\'ll remember. Given what happened to Ryouko before, the conclusion seems obvious.\"

Kyouko checked to make sure she still had their attention, and continued:

\"The evidence actually strongly implicates Lemaître, even though no one can imagine a suitable motive. However, the AI consented to a code inspection, and TCF validation shows that he wasn\'t involved. So, they don\'t really have any likely suspects at the moment, though they\'re going through the lab personnel.\"

*I thought at first they might have been going after me, like in your vision,* Kyouko thought, simultaneously. *But they would have had no idea I was going to be here. Still, it\'s too much of a coincidence. Something is going on.*

Ryouko gripped the armrests of her chair, feeling some of the emotions she had grown numb to come roaring back to the forefront.

\"You\'re telling me they tried to kill me, and because of that, they almost killed all of us?\" she said, growling the words slightly.

\"Maybe,\" Kyouko said, meeting her gaze.

Ryouko seethed, gritting her teeth. She remembered how Asami had looked, kneeling on the floor in pain, her belly ripped open by a support beam. All because someone wanted to kill her?

\"Is there anything I can do?\" Ryouko asked. \"How can I make sure this doesn\'t happen again?\"

Kyouko shrugged.

\"Hope the investigators come up with something, I guess,\" she said.

\"They\'re just going to attack me again,\" Ryouko said. \"And this time they might get me, or Asami‐chan, and---\"

She cut herself off, the anger percolating to the surface again. Her thoughts flowed with deadly clarity.

*Whoever is trying to kill me is trying to kill both of us,* Ryouko thought to Kyouko. *If I stay here, all that\'s going to happen is it will happen again, and I will get killed, and so might...*

Kyouko didn\'t answer, but at that moment Ryouko didn\'t see Kyouko, or even the hospital room. She was seeing the crystallization of all she had experienced for the past month. The vague hints from the Goddess, her own restlessness at the dull routine of life on Eurydome, the mission offer from Nana---she was destined for greater things. Hadn\'t she wished for that? Her wish wouldn\'t allow her to rest, and furthermore, she didn\'t *want* to rest.

Kyouko was right: there was something going on here. Maybe getting to the bottom of it was what she had to do---maybe that was part of the world her wish was trying to show her. She couldn\'t stay a fixed target---she had to keep moving.

And she had to go on this mission. It related, somehow.

\"Ryouko?\" Asami asked, watching her sit there, eyes unseeing.

Ryouko let out a breath.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said, quietly.

\"What?\" Asami asked.

Ryouko put one hand to her head, then pulled it away.

\"The reason my aunt visited yesterday,\" she said, trying to speak as clearly as she could, \"was to offer me a place in a covert ops mission, one that required my involvement. The truth is, I\'ve been thinking about going back into the field for a while. I haven\'t really been happy living here---not because of you! But because... I don\'t think I can settle down yet, not now. I\'m sorry.\"

She made eye contact with Asami, and the sadness in her eyes felt painful.

\"I have to go,\" she said. \"I can\'t really explain why, but I have to. There\'s so much going on here, and...\"

She gestured inchoately with one hand. She saw her mother open her mouth to speak, then close it again.

\"Well, I think I have to come back afterward, for a while,\" she said, looking away. \"I have an obligation to give the scientists as much data as they think is useful. But for now, it seems like the lab will be shut down, and---\"

\"It\'s alright,\" Asami said, surprising Ryouko into making eye contact. The girl\'s expression was surprisingly determined.

\"I always suspected you would want to leave,\" Asami said, pinning her with her eyes. \"You\'ve told me your wish, after all. I just...\"

Asami\'s voice petered out and she dropped her gaze. Ryouko thought about what to say, but then Asami continued, taking a breath, and looking back at her:

\"Just take me with you, that\'s all I want,\" she said.

Ryouko frowned, looking at Kyouko.

\"I\'m not sure I could take you with me,\" she said. \"And if there\'s still someone trying to kill me, it\'s safer just to stay away. I don\'t want you hurt---\"

\"Do you think I care?\"

Asami voice cut incisively through her own, sharp and loud. The girl lunged forward, grabbing Ryouko by the arm, causing one of the monitors to start beeping.

\"Asami‐chan, please calm down,\" Ryouko\'s mother interjected, moving forward to try and pull the girl back. \"You shouldn\'t be moving like that.\"

But Asami held Ryouko\'s arm with indelible force, and they met eyes once again, so that Ryouko could feel the force of her will.

They battled there for a moment, and then Ryouko closed her eyes, dropping her head in concession.

\"Alright. If Kyouko can make it work, alright.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"You can\'t be serious,\" Mami said, leaning across the table to stare at Kyouko.

Kyouko grimaced.

*I knew she\'d respond like this,* she thought, sighing internally.

That was why she had asked for a VR meeting in the first place, after all. A little chat, at a table in a café they had frequented together long ago, with virtual tea---it was supposed to be disarming. More disarming than yelling at each other over a voice line or a video call, anyway.

Kyouko did her best to smile into the face of the Field Marshal\'s disapproval.

\"Look, it\'s not *that* crazy, Mami,\" she said. \"If there\'s evidence Homura might be involved in this, one of us should be involved, right? You\'re busy and we both know Yuma never leaves Earth. That leaves me.\"

\"We both know that this is about your damn cult,\" Mami said, leaning onto her arm, hand on her forehead and eyes closed, pantomiming a headache. \"I can\'t believe Internal Security leaked it to you.\"

It had certainly helped that Kuroi Kana had approved the leak, but Kyouko knew not to mention that.

\"It\'s not *just* about my Church,\" Kyouko responded. \"Look, I can keep my responsibilities to the Union separate from my responsibilities to the Church.\"

Mami looked up at her, then shook her head.

\"You say that, but you know that\'s not really true. Let\'s say you hypothetically meet Homura. I\'m sure she knows about your cult. I wouldn\'t be surprised if that weren\'t part of the reason she\'s staying away. How could you keep that separate?\"

Kyouko gritted her teeth, keeping her instinctual anger under control. They\'d had this particular argument before, and it didn\'t help to argue with Mami about the Church and Homura once again. That\'d just poison the atmosphere.

\"It doesn\'t matter, Mami,\" she said, looking the other girl in the eye. \"You know I\'m right. If Homura is involved, one of us should be in the area. It\'s not like I\'m a newbie. I can handle myself in any situation. That\'s the only compensation we have for being this old.\"

\"It\'s so tentative, though,\" Mami said, glancing away. \"So one of the last places where Homura might have been was a planet the Ordo Illustrata docked at. It\'s a bit of grasping at straws.\"

\"Straws are all we got,\" Kyouko said, shrugging. \"And there always was something weird about that cult. The Church keeps track of any that involve magic or magical girls and they always seemed... too well organized. They had too many resources. We had them under special watch. The theory was that it was related to someone\'s wish, which, you know...\"

She and Mami cringed simultaneously, obviously thinking about the same thing.

\"But anyway, we never found any wishes that matched up, and the founder\'s daughter was already dead. Then they disappeared and didn\'t turn back up, so we forgot about it.\"

Mami shook her head, clasping her hands together around her cup of tea, now quite cold.

\"If it were just a matter of my judgment, Kyouko, and if it were anyone else, I\'d still say no,\" Mami said, looking back up at Kyouko. \"But, I will respect that it is you. You can go.\"

Mami paused, frowning slightly.

\"But did you have to take Shizuki‐san with you? Not Sayaka, but---\"

\"Yeah, Ryouko‐chan, obviously,\" Kyouko said, still frowning at Mami\'s unexpected use of her personal name. \"Look, she came willingly, and I can\'t say I blame her, after what happened.\"

Mami peered down into her tea.

\"I can\'t believe there\'s still someone trying to kill her. I had hoped the previous time was some sort of crazy misunderstanding. The idea that there\'d still be someone doing this kind of thing, someone we can\'t track, and then this business with the Ordo Illustrata, and this vague Homura connection. My instincts tell me something is very wrong. I\'ve told you about what I\'ve learned about the missing grief cubes, and this new complaint from Clarisse...\"

Mami let her voice trail off, and they sat in grim silence for a moment.

\"It could still be nothing,\" Kyouko said, shaking her head sadly. "The soul gem might have been weaker than they thought. She was the one who destroyed the last generator, with a lightning storm. It would have taken a lot of power. Maybe they didn\'t give it enough grief cubes.\"

\"Would Clarisse have made that kind of mistake?\" Mami said, still looking into her tea. \"Does that make any sense?\"

Kyouko sighed, and leaned back into her chair.

\"No, she wouldn\'t. And it doesn\'t. For a soul gem to just fail like that is crazy.\"

Mami sat back, looking up at the wooden ceiling of the café.

\"Something like this happening to someone close to someone like Clarisse elevates this whole affair to an entirely new political plane,\" Mami said. \"And if someone inside the MSY is responsible, they would know this. Clarisse will be breathing fire the next Committee meeting. The ramifications could be enormous, especially if it comes out we didn\'t tell everyone right away.\"

\"We don\'t know that someone was *responsible,* Mami,\" Kyouko said. "It could just be a new phenomenon.\"

\"Things like this don\'t just start happening,\" Mami said. \"You know that. Someone was responsible, even if we don\'t know how.\"

Kyouko leaned her head into her hand and sighed again, then took a bite of her chocolate croissant.

It might as well have been cardboard.

\"Fortunately, Clarisse is more reasonable than that,\" Mami continued, when Kyouko didn\'t say anything further. \"Of course she is. For now she\'s keeping things to herself, but if we don\'t start producing results with this investigation... well, you can guess how she put it.\"

\"Who else knows?\" Kyouko asked.

\"The rest of her team, of course,\" Mami said. \"Though for now, they\'re satisfied to hear we\'re working on it. No one has told Shizuki‐san, though.\"

\"And no one will,\" Kyouko said. \"Or at least we won\'t. Not until we know.\"

She put one hand thoughtfully to her cheek.

\"Does Clarisse think she can help?\" she asked. \"If there\'s anyone whose judgment I might trust, it\'s someone like her.\"

\"Maybe,\" Mami said. \"She doesn\'t know yet. She did say it might have something to do with a mission Virani‐san was involved in, about a decade ago. Some incident on the planet of New California.\"

Kyouko looked off to the side for a moment, digging through her memory.

\"I haven\'t heard of this,\" she said.

\"Neither had I,\" Mami said. \"It\'s absurdly and explicitly classified, both on the MSY and Governance level---and you know how rare explicit classification is. Apparently there was a string of unsolved disappearances on the planet. Teenage girls, but not magical girls. Public Order wasn\'t having any luck, and neither was the Soul Guard, so she and one of her teammates were sent undercover to investigate. The evidence suggested it was a magical girl with family problems who had found out about the cloning program and had gone a little insane. They weren\'t able to capture the girl alive. Nasty business.\"

Kyouko wrinkled her nose, making a face at the explanation.

\"Except why would it be so classified? The cloning thing is common knowledge for mid‐level security clearance. That explanation also makes no sense. Were there any other details?\"

Mami shook her head.

\"No. That\'s essentially all there is to read, and if I can\'t read any further, who can? So few details, such a high classification---there\'s something important being left out.\"

\"Obviously,\" Kyouko echoed. \"Does Clarisse know more?\"

\"I asked,\" Mami said, anticipating the question. \"No. She just knows Misa mentioned it vaguely to her teammates once, and seemed uneasy about it. She\'s not really sure why she thinks it\'s important---just one of those instinct things.\"

\"One of those instinct things, huh...\" Kyouko said, letting her voice trail off.

\"Yeah,\" Mami said. \"One of those.\"

She slid downward, resting her head on her arms.

\"According to the records, there was a delay in shipping Misa Virani\'s clone onto the ship after the battle, because her primary was lost on the surface of Apollo along with one of the city centers. Because she was Black Heart, she had a secondary clone on ice on a more secure planet, but it was necessary to get it shipped out. During that period, the transport vessel was forced to reroute because of residual Cephalopod combat vessels in the sector. It was two weeks before the clone arrived at Zhukov.\"

She didn\'t check to see if Kyouko understood her, because Kyouko had already heard the account. Mami was just reciting it out loud again, trying to see if there was anything she missed.

\"Since we needed to wait for a clone to arrive, one of the soul mages aboard put her soul gem in induced stasis, and we stored it next to a grief cube maintenance system. According to Zhukov\'s logs, just before the clone arrived, the soul gem luminescence dropped catastrophically, despite immediate grief cube support. By the time the soul mage arrived, the gem was already disappearing. Video surveillance confirms the scenario.\"

\"But it makes no sense,\" Kyouko said, reiterating their previous discussion. \"We\'ve had this kind of soul gem storage down to a science for decades. This kind of thing doesn\'t make sense.\"

\"Well, it happened now. None of the other girls who \'disappeared\' have done so under quite so much surveillance.\"

\"I don\'t buy it.\"

\"Well, I don\'t either.\"

\"The soul mage---\"

\"I\'ve known her for over a decade. She wouldn\'t. Besides, we already---\"

\"I know, Mami. We\'ve already had this talk. I\'m not asking if you already investigated her. I\'m asking if you asked her if she noticed anything unusual about the soul gem.\"

\"We did,\" Mami said, biting her lip adorably without realizing it. "She didn\'t notice anything unusual, besides the soul gem being way more corrupted than it should be.\"

\"Have you asked for her memories?\"

Mami bit her lip again.

\"That\'s a bit much, isn\'t it?\"

\"You know that\'s the only way to totally prove innocence, and with magic we only have her word to go on that she didn\'t do anything.\"

\"But for a human, especially a magical girl, only a mind‐reader could extract provably accurate memories. Do you know what that\'s like? I know her---\"

Kyouko stood up, grabbing Mami\'s shoulders and peering down into her eyes.

\"I know you don\'t like it, Mami. I\'m sorry. But you know this is too important to beat around the bush. Order the mind‐read. It\'s not that bad, Mami. With consent, it barely feels like anything. Please. I know you. You\'re putting off the inevitable.\"

Mami looked down, pulling on her virtual skirt. Kyouko could see her eyes flutter, one of them tearing slightly.

*Oh Goddess, no,* Kyouko thought.

She had made a mistake. Mami was more sensitive than she thought. More sensitive than she should have been. It---

She hastily summoned a virtual handkerchief, bending down to dab Mami\'s eyes. She looked Mami in the eyes, as heartfelt as she could.

\"I\'m sorry, alright?\" Kyouko said. \"I said too much. Come on.\"

Mami sucked in a breath, gaining control of herself.

\"I--I\'m sorry,\" she said. \"I don\'t know what came over me. Losing control of myself at my age. It\'s embarrassing. The topic isn\'t even---\"

Kyouko did what she thought she had to: she leaned over and hugged Mami, closing her eyes for a moment.

She felt Mami squirm in surprise.

\"What\'s going on, Kyouko?\" she asked, confused. \"It\'s not that bad---\"

Kyouko released the hug, standing back up, looking into the middle distance for a moment. Hugging Mami took her back, *waaay* back, to before her father had flipped out and killed her family. Before everything changed.

Then she looked at Mami again.

\"Just wanted to cheer you up,\" she said, with false flippancy. \"You seem stressed.\"

Mami took a deep breath, looking down at the table for a moment.

\"Yeah, I guess I am,\" she said. \"Thanks. You\'re right, though. I was just putting it off. I have to order the mind‐read. It\'s only proper.\"

Mami grabbed her teacup, downing the entire cup in one go, entirely the opposite of her usual manner of drinking tea.

Mami let out a breath as she finished, then looked at Kyouko.

\"I guess I need to get going,\" she said. \"I\'ve been here for too long already, and my schedule...\"

\"Yeah, sure,\" Kyouko said, nodding.

Mami winked out of the simulation, body dissolving into little motes of light, a fancy little effect. Kyouko watched the spot where she had been for a long moment.

*Fuck,* she thought.

Then she collapsed into her chair and rubbed the palm of her hand into her face.

She began drafting a classified memo.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Mami held her soul gem in front of her in both hands.*

\"*In theory, mind‐reading should be one of the easiest skills for a magical girl to learn, even with no head start,*\" *a familiar voice said.* \"*Our natural telepathy is already the beginning of it. One only needs to grow it.*\"

*Mami peered into her soul gem, the golden, pulsing glow emanating from within its cage seeming to envelop her vision.*

\"*And yet, it is often one of the hardest. It takes a great deal of experience, an understanding of others, and even of yourself.*\"

\"*Nice speech,*\" *Kyouko said, sucking a lollipop.* \"*Sounds like we\'re trying to meditate. You telepaths are* weird.

*Mami blinked, turning to look at her.*

\"*Why am I here, anyway?*\" *Kyouko asked.* \"*This is Mami\'s show.*\"

\"*Mami knows you well,*\" *the voice said.* \"*And you\'re the only one of her friends who\'d actually let her try reading your mind. Think about it.*\"

*Kyouko shrugged, making a show of yawning. She could be so immature sometimes, Mami thought. It was annoying, yet oddly endearing.*

*There was someone at the corner of her vision, just out of sight. A woman, the source of the voice---she turned her head, passing her gaze over where she was. And yet, as fast as the image entered her mind, it vanished, a blank in her consciousness.*

\"*Remember, I\'m manipulating your mental state with my power,*\" *the girl said.* \"*To increase self‐understanding. It makes the process easier. But the final step is for you alone to perform. I can only guide it.*\"

*Mami sensed, rather than saw, Kyouko rolling her eyes, yet she kept her gaze at the patch of space in front of her. The space was clearly occupied, but her mind refused to fill in who was there.*

\"*If Kyouko‐san here had deigned to listen to my explanation earlier, she would remember that the mind magics are the most sensitive to state of mind, to analogy and focus. Well, at least for learning.*\"

*She pointed at Mami\'s soul gem, and Mami gazed back at the luminescent stone.*

\"*Gaze into it. The soul gem will help serve as a focus. Empty your mind. Be like a still pool of water, sensitive to even the slightest breeze.*\"

*Mami knew from experience that emptying your mind was much easier said than done, especially in the dead of night when she couldn\'t avoid thinking about the regrets of her life.*

*And yet---*

*It must have been true that the girl was manipulating her mental state, because she felt her mind emptying as instructed. The golden glow of her soul gem grew again, seeming to absorb into it all that she was, and all that she had been.*

\"*What do you hear?*\" *the voice asked, though it seemed to Mami that it came from far away.*

\"*Nothing,*\" *she said.*

\"*Someday, that will change,*\" *the voice said.* \"*But for now, think about Kyouko‐san. Try to imagine that you* are *her. Think about how you feel, and what you\'re thinking of. Not just the thoughts, but also the sensations.*\"

*Kyouko snorted in derision, but it only helped Mami.*

This is stupid, *Mami thought, doing her best imitation of Kyouko.* This is boring. I wouldn\'t even be here if it weren\'t for Mami\'s sake. I want to take a nap. I\'m tired.

*Mami let a sense of tiredness wash over her, even if she didn\'t really feel it. It seemed right for Kyouko.*

*Nothing changed, though. Was she making progress?*

\"*Try to imagine what the lollipop she\'s eating tastes like,*\" *the voice suggested.* \"*What it feels like to have* that *much hair, and that giant ribbon. What it\'s like to sit with your elbow on your knee.*\"

*Kyouko grunted in annoyance, and Mami tried to incorporate that, too, along with the sourness of the candy in her mouth, the hair pulling down on the back of her head...*

I wonder how they talked Mami into this, *Mami thought, taking another shot at thinking like Kyouko.* I thought we agreed that the whole idea was icky. But I guess her work is just too important to her. I bet that\'s it. She puts too much stress on herself.

Speaking of stress, I\'m hungry. Oh, Yuma gave me a cookie earlier! I wonder if I still have it in my pocket---

\"*Ah!*\" *Mami vocalized, startled out of her trance. She darted a glance at Kyouko, who stared back, frozen in the middle of reaching into her jacket pocket with one hand.*

\"*You have a cookie in your pocket,*\" *Mami said, feeling silly for saying it with so much awe in her voice.*

*She paused, thinking for a moment.*

\"*Chocolate chip,*\" *she added.*

*Kyouko raised her lip in slight incredulity, glancing between Mami and the other girl. Then, slowly, she pulled a chocolate chip cookie, wrapped in paper, out of her pocket.*

\"*Don\'t tell me this training actually worked,*\" *Kyouko said, with an \'I don\'t want to believe it\' kind of voice.*

\"*I knew you could do it!*\" *the mysterious woman said, happiness clear in her voice.* \"*Very few manage to do it on their first try. I guess you really are old.*\"

\"*Thanks for putting it that way,*\" *Mami said sarcastically, glaring at the woman she could not see.*

\"*Sorry, sorry,*\" *the girl said.* \"*Anyway,* just so you know, *it wouldn\'t be that hard now to try some mild suggestion. You simply imagine* doing *things instead. And it\'s useful in combat. You don\'t have *to use it on anyone human.*\"

\"*I\'d really prefer not to,*\" *Mami said.* \"*You know why.*\"

\"*Mami with mind‐control powers would be a nightmare anyway,*\" *Kyouko said, sneering.* \"*Imagine if she could \'suggest\' to me to act more polite at meetings. Oh geez, I feel like a robot already.*\"

*Then Kyouko started pantomiming robot motions with her arms, and Mami heard herself laughing along with the mysterious voice.*

The laughter echoed in her ears as her eyes opened, and she found that she had buried herself in the blankets of her bed, in her cabin on the Zhukov.

*What the hell was that?* she thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"As you have no doubt learned during your training, imagination is key to the development of new magical powers. Things that you can imagine yourself doing---these are the things that become possible. Initially, everything is a struggle, and must be done through analogy or explicit construction, like Mami‐san\'s famous ribbon muskets. But it is clear that she no longer consciously *thinks* about how her guns are assembled, or she could never even fire one in combat. So it must be for you when it comes to telepathic defense.\"

Ryouko nodded, acknowledging the obviously rehearsed speech. Across from her sat Gracia Perez, the telepath she had met in the wormhole mission, and who had given the speech. Next to her, Asami was also listening intently. One seat over sat Kyouko, here to monitor her trainee. Finally, Marianne François rounded out the girls seated at the table. Apparently, she had been sent by Mami to accompany Kyouko on the mission.

Of the five, Gracia, Ryouko, and Asami were transformed; the rest were not.

Ryouko looked up at the room they were seated in. This wasn\'t a specialized training center---it was an ordinary‐looking living area, with an adjoining kitchen. Large by Earth standards, Ryouko had seen many places like it in the housing brochure she and Asami had flipped through on their way to Eurydome.

This wasn\'t Eurydome, though---this was a starship, and they were seated in Gracia\'s cabin. For shipboard accommodation, it was downright exorbitant. Ryouko didn\'t think even Mami\'s cabin had been as large.

Then she looked down at the soul gem she held in both of her hands. Gracia had told her and Asami to transform, then summon the gem, even specifying the exact manner in which they were supposed to hold it. Ryouko suspected they were about to use the gem as a focus---that was possible, according to her basic training, though she had never been asked to actually try it.

Thinking back to her training made her remember all that had come after that, and for a moment she remembered Marianne crying at her daughter\'s funeral. What was it she had said? That she had warned her daughter away from fieldwork? Wasn\'t accompanying Kyouko on this mission considered fieldwork?

Ryouko realized she had zoned out, as she asked Clarisse to replay the part of the lecture she had missed. It was a bit of a bad habit, but...

\"Unfortunately, telepathic defense is harder than attack, especially when it comes to blocking mere mind‐reading. As a passive defense, it is possible to simply avoid thinking about sensitive topics, but any skilled telepath is capable of drawing a person\'s mind to a topic. Therefore, any truly good defense must work passively, even when you\'re not on guard, even when you\'re not transformed, possibly even when you\'re asleep.\"

Gracia paused, making a point of pinning her and Asami with her eyes to make sure they got the point. Something about the girl\'s dark eyes unnerved Ryouko.

\"But,\" she continued, smiling, \"you\'re new, and not specialist telepaths, and we don\'t have much time. That\'s way too much to expect of you. I\'ll be satisfied if you can put up a credible mental block when you know you\'re being targeted. Perhaps you will receive more training in the future.\"

\"Excuse me,\" Asami interjected, raising their hand as if they were in school. \"I\'m just curious. Do all the, uh, MSY executives have this kind of training?\"

She directed the question at Gracia, seeming to realize only after a few seconds of silence that Kyouko was also sitting at the table.

Kyouko smiled slightly when Asami finally looked at her, tilting her head and closing her eyes.

\"The more important we got, the more important it was that we know how to do these things. We\'re pretty well‐sealed. I actually have to turn it off, rather than on. Plus, all us old‐timers are pretty well‐trained. Back in the day, you heard horror stories about what girls with mind‐control could do. Entire cities of girls enthralled, things like that. You can bet when we started having training for telepathic defense, *everyone* showed up. Nowadays, we don\'t even teach *any anti‐magical girl techniques to most new girls. It feels weird to me, even if I know why we don\'t.\"

Asami looked down, frowning.

\"I guess I\'ve never thought about using mind‐control on other... people.\"

It seemed to Ryouko like an odd statement for her to make, but no one else at the table seemed taken aback. Gracia even nodded slightly.

\"It\'s not something you typically think about, but it\'s something that\'s definitely possible,\" she said. \"It\'s not as if there\'s something special about humans that makes them any harder to control than squid.\"

Asami blanched, and Ryouko saw Kyouko glare at Gracia, who looked confused.

\"Well, magical girls *are* special,\" Gracia said, a little hastily. "We\'re more difficult to control than most humans, because of the soul gem. Even a little basic training goes a long way. Most mind‐controllers can only manage suggestion and manipulation against a girl with training, not outright control. Plus, implants also really help. There even exist implant setups that can help a normal human resist telepathic attack.\"

*It\'s true,* Clarisse thought, before Ryouko could think to ask. *It\'s written in the manuals. I\'m supposed to keep you on task in the face of mental manipulation, or to block certain thoughts. Of course, a truly good telepath could override implants, and probably me too. Plus the implants they issue to Governance Officials are only somewhat effective.*

Ryouko blinked, absorbing the information Clarisse had given her in accelerated format.

\"In any case,\" Gracia said, shaking her head slightly, long hair sifting over her shoulders. \"Resisting mind‐control is actually a somewhat different topic from resisting mind‐*reading.* Usually we focus on the latter, since it\'s much more common nowadays, and also a bit easier. Now look into your soul gems.\"

The command surprised Ryouko, who had honestly started to forget what they were doing. She did as instructed, watching her soul gem glow quietly green, casting her fingers in an eerie light.

A moment later, a message arrived from Kyouko.

\"*Secret number! 572. Try to block the telepath from stealing the info!*\"

\"Imagine your mind as a battlecruiser,\" Gracia said, interrupting Ryouko\'s nascent laugh. \"Protected from everything around it by thick armor and powerful forcefields. Imagine doors closing, gates shutting, castle walls. Imagine your magic surrounding your soul gem and your brain, blocking anything from getting in *or out.* Imagine standing in front of a crowd blocking the door out, or a wall standing between me and you. I want you to ponder the imagery that appeals to you the most, and try to seriously focus on *making it real.* And then I will try to steal your secret from you.\"

Ryouko took a breath, and tried to do as directed. She imagined a sheet of metal in front of her, blocking the girl on the other side of the table. She tried to imagine that it extended into her skull, into her eyes, such that nothing got in or out. Gruesome imagery, she realized, but she tried to really imagine it.

She saw her soul gem pulse slightly.

\"Five hundred seventy‐two, Ryouko,\" Gracia said. \"And one thousand thirty‐six, Miss Nakihara.\"

Ryouko let out a breath.

\"Damn,\" she heard Asami say, mirroring her own thought.

\"You girls were more successful than you realize. I had to try a bit harder than I usually do.\"

\"Do we have to use our imagination every time?\" Asami asked. \"I don\'t want to have to imagine a battlecruiser every time I need it. Especially not in combat.\"

\"Fortunately, no,\" Gracia said. \"As you practice, you\'ll be able to do it faster and faster. Eventually, it won\'t take more than a thought. I don\'t know if you girls will be able to get to that point in just a few days, but if you do, we can talk about willpower, and magic consumption, and all sorts of advanced topics.\"

Ryouko and Asami looked at Gracia, then at each other.

\"We should try again,\" Gracia said.

\"Let\'s take a little break,\" Kyouko said, grabbing a plate of dark chocolate cookies from a wheeled robot that had slid up to the table. They smelled oddly---and deliciously---fragrant, and Ryouko realized that she was hungry.

\"Mami taught me the value of cookies made by hand,\" Kyouko said, mumbling as she picked one up and wolfed it down. \"But I\'m way too lazy to actually do it. The Church has a baker who makes them for me. I\'m surprised this place has a cooking robot. You don\'t see many of those.\"

Gracia smiled crookedly.

\"They pamper us sometimes, when they feel like it,\" she said.

Then, after a pause:

\"Which is entirely too rare for my taste. Can\'t you ask Mami‐san to look into that? We\'re Spec Ops! I want to be pampered!\"

\"I feel as if I should point out how much you girls get paid,\" Marianne said archly, breaking her silence.

\"When do I ever get to *use* it?\"

\"That\'s why I told my daughter to get out when she still could. Instead, you know what happened.\"

Gracia gave Marianne an odd look, which Marianne returned a moment later. They sat there in silence for a few seconds, on the verge of saying something, but biting their tongues. It felt really awkward for Ryouko, who was caught in the middle of eating a cookie, but unable to express how surprisingly *good* it was, because this was *not* the appropriate time to say anything.

\"Ladies, let\'s focus,\" Kyouko said, finally. \"Whatever past disputes we may have had, we\'re all involved in this, and we need to see it through. We don\'t want any accidents, and that means we need to get the new girls up to speed.\"

The others nodded silently in agreement, Ryouko grabbed another cookie, and then Asami said:

\"I\'ve been meaning to ask: Why are we focusing so much on fighting other magical girls? I thought we were investigating a rogue religious group. I\'m not sure why we\'re spending all this time on telepathic resistance and combat tactics for unknown magic. Are we expecting to fight hostile magical girls?\"

Kyouko and the other older girls glanced at each other, communicating by eye contact. Finally, Kyouko put one fist to her mouth, clearing her throat lightly.

\"We don\'t *expect* there to be hostile magical girls, but these kinds of rogue colony missions turn them up surprisingly often. A lot of the time, these girls have never heard of the MSY, and have to be dealt with delicately. Other times, the colony is hostile and the girls agree with the rest of colony, and we can\'t talk them out of it. There\'s other possibilities.\"

\"Remember that the colony appears to still be functional,\" Marianne said. \"Unfortunately, a stealth probe can\'t evaluate demon populations or anything like that, but the probe we sent picked up plenty of people on the surface.\"

\"They\'re friendly a lot of the time, too,\" Gracia said, her eyes fixed on Kyouko. \"Sometimes, they\'re glad to see us, or they need rescuing. Don\'t get the wrong idea.\"

Kyouko and Gracia shared a look, but Ryouko found herself confused. The way they spoke seemed to imply---

\"How many rogue colonies *were* there?\" she asked, glancing at Asami, who looked wide‐eyed and confused. \"I was always under the impression that rogue colonies were mostly a hypothetical situation.\"

Another shared look between the three older girls. Kyouko opened her mouth to speak, but Marianne cut her off, putting a hand on her arm and shaking her head.

\"It\'ll be easier if we just introduce her to Azrael. She can explain it to them.\"

The two girls stared at each other for a moment, Ryouko and Asami looking on. They seemed to be having a telepathic conversation of some sort. Ryouko mused that this was what Asami must have felt like, watching Ryouko and her mother talk.

All Ryouko knew about Azrael was that she was a shy, black‐haired girl they had been introduced to when they had first boarded the ship. They had shaken hands. Ryouko remembered her for being even shorter than her, almost child‐like, standing there in a jacket, skirt, and boots. She had been *really* shy, blushing while shaking Ryouko\'s hand, which had seemed really odd once Ryouko looked up her age---she turned out to be nearly forty.

\"They\'re going to see her in action eventually anyway,\" Marianne finished. \"It\'s probably better to have them know ahead of time.\"

\"Alright,\" Kyouko said.

She turned to face Ryouko and Asami.

\"I\'ll send a message to Azrael. The two of you set up a time to go visit her in her room ASAP. Got that?\"

Ryouko nodded, as Asami voiced her assent.

\"Any other questions?\" Kyouko asked, glancing between the two of them. "Might as well ask now. I realize the mission briefing assumed a lot.\"

Ryouko and Asami shared a look. Asami shrugged.

Ryouko turned to face Gracia.

\"I wanted to ask,\" she said. \"I thought MagOps teams were kept together whenever possible, yet only some of you are here. Has the team been broken up?\"

Gracia shifted in her position, looking uncomfortable.

\"Well, we\'ve taken some casualties, as you know,\" she said. \"We\'re officially on standby right now until... certain things get resolved. Kuroi‐san put out the word that we could join this mission individually. She thought it\'d be helpful for you since we were part of your team. Mina and I signed on because of your connection with the Goddess, and Annabelle because she was getting bored. Nadya has something she has to deal with, and Ying‐zhi is taking a vacation. It\'s good for us to get away from each other once in a while.\"

Marianne had snorted at the reference to the Goddess, and it occurred to Ryouko that she had never asked Marianne\'s opinion of the Cult. Juliet had been quite devout; Marianne, it seemed, not so much. Another source of mother‐daughter tension.

Ryouko nodded. It made sense.

\"Anything else?\" Gracia asked, peering at her carefully.

\"Not right now,\" Ryouko said. \"I can always ask later if I think of anything.\"

\"Then let\'s continue with the training.\"

Ryouko heard Asami sigh, and grabbed a cookie.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eventually, they were able to take a break from training. Kyouko had recommended that they nap, but neither of them were really in the mood to sleep, so they were simply laying awake in bed. On Eurydome, when their relationship had still been new, they had gotten separate bedrooms, though the arrival of Ryouko\'s mother had pushed Ryouko from her bed into Asami\'s. For the accommodations on this ship, they had dispensed with what had become a pretense.

Ryouko had tried browsing her old haunts on the internet, which had been one of her major pre‐contract hobbies---her only hobby, if she were being honest.

As was starting to happen too often nowadays, though, she couldn\'t get into it, so instead she asked Asami a question.

\"Why did you come with me?\"

\"Hmm?\" Asami asked, looking up from running her hand idly through Ryouko\'s hair as it lay on the pillow.

Ryouko didn\'t say anything further, feeling that her meaning should have been clear enough, and a moment later Asami responded:

\"Well, I wasn\'t looking forward to having to live with your mother while you were away.\"

Ryouko shook her head slightly.

\"I\'m serious,\" she said. \"You don\'t like combat. You could have stayed back. Granted, this isn\'t exactly a combat mission, but still...\"

She heard Asami let out a breath, the warm air wafting softly against the side of her neck.

\"Well, how do I put it?\" the girl said. \"I\'d be lying if I said I knew exactly what I was doing. I didn\'t really think it through that much. I just knew if I were with you, I wouldn\'t mind the combat much.\"

In the pause that followed, Ryouko felt another gust of air against her neck.

\"I guess I would say that when you have a good thing, you don\'t let go of it easily,\" Asami added, finally.

Ryouko turned her head slightly to look at Asami.

\"Do you think not following me would have been letting me go?\" she asked, allowing their eyes to make contact.

Asami looked away from her for a moment, and said:

\"You don\'t think I\'m worried about you? You said someone is trying to kill you. If that happens again, I\'d prefer to be there for you, even if I get another metal beam through my gut. I mean that.\"

Asami smiled wanly for a moment.

Then the smile faded, and she said:

\"Well that\'s not the entire reason. When you took me to that Cult center, that Ribbon---the Goddess said that it was important I stick with you, for your safety.\"

\"You stopped me from hitting the ground, in the gravity chamber,\" Ryouko said, shading her eyes. \"I thought that was you, but we never talked about it.\"

\"I don\'t think it was just for your safety,\" Asami said. \"The way she talked about you, how you\'re a wanderer, and a leader, not a follower... I\'ve thought about that, and I don\'t think we\'re destined to live quietly. It was fun, but you can\'t live your life like that.\"

Asami reached over Ryouko\'s shoulder with one arm and pulled them together, so that her head rested against Ryouko\'s neck, and Ryouko could feel her light breathing against her skin.

Ryouko was surprised, but returned the embrace.

They lay there for a moment.

\"I feel sorry for your mother,\" Asami said, finally. \"She\'s not happy about this, you know. If I really *had* stayed, it would have killed me to watch her worry.\"

\"I know she isn\'t,\" Ryouko said, \"but what can I do?\"

\"I know. It\'s just... I wish I could make her happier somehow.\"

Ryouko stayed silent, wondering what her mother or Asami would think if they knew that Akemi Homura might be involved in this. It was only a distant connection, but...

Well, she knew, even without asking Kyouko or Nana, that it was a bad idea to say anything about it to anyone else. Nana was traveling with them, of course, and had promised her mother that she\'d watch over Ryouko. Ryouko didn\'t think that had really reassured her mother, or that her mother really approved of Nana\'s path in life.

It was... what it was.

For a long moment they lay there, Asami breathing against her skin, their hair coiled together intimately, and Ryouko thought Asami was asleep.

\"We need to talk about Clarisse,\" Asami said, abruptly.

Ryouko tensed, both in surprise and in trepidation, and Asami laughed softly.

\"She still sends me messages, you know,\" Asami said. \"I think she really wants us to work out. The way she writes, and the way you talk about her sometimes... she\'s sentient, isn\'t she?\"

*Sentient.*

The word was foreboding, carrying heavy weight in this age of artificial intelligence and in the light of what they had learned about ethics in school. For a moment, Ryouko didn\'t know what to say.

*It\'s alright,* Clarisse thought, transmitting the message to both of them. *Yes, I am. Please don\'t tell anyone.*

Asami laughed again.

*Do you watch when we... you know?* Asami thought back.

*I swear, I wouldn\'t if it were at all possible for me not to, Clarisse responded, sounding embarrassed.

*That\'s what I thought.*

Ryouko felt Asami shake her head slightly.

*Well, I guess I have to get used to it. I\'m not sure what to think about it. It\'s a little embarrassing, I guess.*

Ryouko and Clarisse both waited for her to say something further, but it never came, Asami seeming satisfied with the discussion.

A short while later, Asami was truly asleep, but Ryouko kept her eyes open, wondering what the future would bring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They visited Azrael Elizabeth Maslanka half a day later, after a series of brutal---and bruising---combat training sessions with Kyouko and Nana. Neither of them had any training fighting other magical girls, and the basic combat instincts were nearly laughable in the face of a four‐and‐half‐century‐old Ancient, or in the face of a Black Heart operative whose power was literally the neutralization of magic and advanced technology.

Kyouko claimed there was no shame in losing to an Ancient, but even so, it was not heartening to learn that either of the older girls could consistently kill the two of them in less than five minutes---Ryouko even suspected that the two girls had been holding back.

Azrael was expecting them, of course, and the door to her room slid open on their approach. The room was luxuriously large, as Gracia\'s had been, and decorated in largely the same fashion---there had obviously been no time for anyone to customize their living areas.

Even so, they paused in the doorway to peer in surprise. Both the wall directly opposite them and the half‐wall that separated the main room from the kitchen were adorned with absurdly large pairs of wings, one bulky and ruffled with an assortment of colorful feathers, the other separated into two parts, covered with what looked like a stretched sheet of... metal? Plastic?

It was probably some sort of metamaterial, Ryouko decided, waving aside Clarisse\'s offer to analyze the material in more frequencies. It wasn\'t *that* important, obviously.

The far wall had been set to display a hologram of an unfamiliar, dark red alien sky. The cloud banks looked like they went on forever, and Ryouko honestly felt a little vertiginous looking at it. On the wall next to that hung what appeared to be a giant metal fan.

*Remember,* Clarisse whispered in her ear, *her record lists her powers as flying and telepathy.*

Oh, that made sense. Ryouko decided that Azrael was probably just a little eccentric when it came to her powers. It wasn\'t even close to unheard of---Asami still got giddy sometimes in the gravity chamber, and had to be shaken out of it.

Azrael herself had walked forward to greet them, waiting while they stared at her decorations.

She looked embarrassed, and seemed even more diminutive than Ryouko remembered.

\"Hi---welcome,\" the girl said in a high‐pitched voice, directing the two of them towards a set of chairs arranged around a narrow coffee table.

They sat as directed, then glanced at each other. The girl\'s nervous demeanor and voice seemed odd in light of her older age---both Ryouko and Asami were used to older girls effortlessly dominating conversations.

*Why did Kyouko send us to her?* Ryouko wondered. What could this girl possibly have to tell them that Kyouko couldn\'t?

They watched Azrael for a moment as the girl crossed and uncrossed her legs. The girl was wearing a knee‐length dress, coupled with a tank top and jacket, which seemed like an incongruous combination to Ryouko.

\"So I\'m supposed to talk to you about rogue colonies,\" Azrael said, finally.

\"Yes,\" Ryouko answered, simply.

\"Well, are you familiar with Governance ideological restrictions on the establishment of colonies?\" Azrael asked, voice seeming to smooth out a little.

Ryouko glanced at Asami, checking which of them was going to respond. Asami tilted her head slightly, indicating that Ryouko should take the lead.

Ryouko faced Azrael again, mulling over the question in her mind.

\"Well, broadly speaking, Governance just wants colonies to guarantee the Core Rights, right? There\'s also restrictions on how much modification colonists can make to social structures, and to their own bodies. Governance wants to make sure its colonies retain their human heritage.\"

Ryouko summarized what she remembered of the topic as best she could, and found Asami nodding along, as Azrael watched her with an odd expression. This was Primary School Civics material, and though Ryouko was sure she knew more on Governance topics than most people, she didn\'t see a need to talk about it at length.

\"That\'s pretty much it,\" Azrael said. \"Do you know what a rogue colony is?\"

\"That\'s a colony that doesn\'t follow the rules,\" Asami said. \"Well, intentionally. A lot of unsponsored colonies have failed rules unintentionally, usually by not being successful enough to provide for their members.\"

Azrael nodded along.

\"Pretty much,\" she said. \"How many rogue colonies do you think there have been?\"

The key question, after several lines of honestly boring conversation. Ryouko found herself ready for it.

\"Well, we were always told that there were only a few, minor cases. Restrictions on free speech, restrictions on divorce, that kind of thing, where the colonial leaders were trying to get away with something they knew wasn\'t allowed. Usually resolved by negotiation. But I get the feeling that I wouldn\'t be here if there weren\'t more cases than that.\"

Azrael glanced off to the side.

\"Honestly, \'more cases\' is an understatement,\" she said, shaking her head. \"And that\'s assuming I know about all of them, which I probably don\'t. There was a long period before the war when Governance didn\'t bother to monitor colony ships that carefully, and quite a few groups managed to slip the net and hide themselves on this or that planet. A lot of them just didn\'t want to be monitored, but a lot of them broke the rules pretty badly. Some of the cases are pretty horrifying, actually.\"

Ryouko sucked in a breath, then glanced at Asami.

\"How horrifying?\" she asked.

Azrael held up her hand, palm inward.

It took a moment for Ryouko to realize that Azrael was making a gesture, though she didn\'t recognize it.

\"I\'d rather not talk about it, and you don\'t need to know,\" Azrael said, with an air of blunt finality. \"Just know that a few of them required military intervention, which you\'ll never get Governance to admit. That\'s all I\'m going to say.\"

The conversation was at a standstill for a moment, the three of them peering at each other quietly.

Finally, Azrael sighed.

\"I\'ve spent most of my life as an agent sent to scout rogue colonies, both for Governance and the Black Heart, though before the war the last part was obviously a bit more secret. It turns out the Incubators are usually glad to recruit girls on rogue colonies to hunt the demons there, without bothering to tell anyone about the colony. I was recruited when I was fourteen.\"

Ryouko frowned at the statement. From the way she said, it almost seemed as if---

She didn\'t finish the thought, because she saw something move rapidly across Azrael\'s eyes.

She and Asami sat there for a moment, Asami\'s mouth slightly open, confused as to what they had seen. It almost seemed like Azrael was looking back at them through a transparent sheath that was covering her eyes, giving them a slight yellowish tint.

Just as abruptly as it had appeared, it retracted, disappearing into the outer corners of her eyes.

Then, as they continued to stare in amazement and befuddlement, the sheath slid back and forth over Azrael\'s eyes several times. It was almost as if she had a second set of horizontal, transparent eyelids.

\"They\'re nictating membranes,\" Azrael said, not meeting their gaze. "They protect my eyes during high‐speed flight. And in addition to that, there\'s also, well...\"

Azrael put a hand to her mouth, surprising Ryouko by blushing furiously, cheeks turning a rosy shade of red.

\"I\'m sorry. I know it\'s not as big a deal for you, but I--I\'m still not used to it. Ah, do you---can you look away for a moment?\"

Ryouko shared another glance with Asami. What on Earth was going on?

They turned away as instructed. Behind her, she heard the rustling of clothing.

Ryouko found herself staring at one of the pairs of wings hanging on the wall. With a strange intuition, Ryouko began to see that the wings were a little too elaborate to be mere decoration. They seemed to be jointed, and mounted in the center was a rather large metal... hump?

\"Okay, you can look now,\" Azrael said finally.

They turned back around, and this time Asami couldn\'t restrain an audible gasp.

Azrael was seated facing partially away from them, back exposed, no longer hidden underneath a jacket or an oddly shaped backpack. Ryouko could see now that what had looked like a tank top was in fact held together in the back by only a small strap.

Down both sides of her back were an array of spine‐like protrusions, each almost ten centimeters long. Each pair flanked one of the vertebrae of her spine, and though they were the same color as her skin, they looked flexible, rather than fleshy. Next to the spines lay two parallel sets of large metal discs, which Ryouko recognized as connection terminals, similar to the one she had on her own lower spine, but larger, deeper, and not hidden beneath the skin.

The two of them stared in frank, open‐mouthed amazement, unable to tear their eyes away, even to look at each other. Images flashed through Ryouko\'s mind, of videos she had been shown in school, of mutants growing in vats, of horror movies she had seen, of Freedom Alliance Elite snipers crawling through ruined cities with feet that were not feet, skin changing color like a chameleon, eyes inhumanly large, covered by transparent second eyelids. In her nightmares they had stalked her, and her mother had yelled at her father for letting her watch a movie like *that*.

\"What did they do to you?\" Asami blurted out, stretching out a hand to touch one of the spines, then jerking it away, realizing what she was doing.

Azrael laughed quietly, before sighing deliberately and loudly. She shook her head, hair sweeping over the topmost spines.

\"Everyone says something like that,\" she said. \"But I was born like this. I---if you want to touch one, go ahead.\"

The two rows of spines twitched, then folded inward, before extending back out. Asami looked strangely fascinated, but Ryouko felt a surge of revulsion, shaking slightly.

*Easy there,* Clarisse thought. *You\'re not being rational. She\'s just as human as either of us. Think about it.*

Ryouko swallowed, allowing Clarisse\'s relayed calmness to wash over her. That was right, wasn\'t it?

*Wasn\'t it?*

She followed Asami\'s lead and touched one of the spines. It felt cartilaginous, like touching someone\'s nose.

Azrael pulled away abruptly, flinging her jacket back around her shoulders in one abrupt motion, facing them again. Her face was still flushed with what was apparently embarrassment.

\"On my planet, we--we never showed our spines to anyone, so it\'s a little embarrassing,\" she explained. \"But it\'s the fastest way to explain things. My---\"

She paused, taking a breath, passing her gaze between the two of them.

\"My colony was founded by geneticists and bioengineers who were angry about Governance\'s policies against improving the human form. They thought it was backwards, that the Freedom Alliance had terrified everyone beyond reason.\"

She shifted her gaze downward, looking at the table.

\"My ancestors told Governance that they were going to set up a small model colony to make their case. Instead, we settled on a different planet entirely, one with an atmosphere so thick it wasn\'t possible to live on the surface.\"

She turned her head toward the holographic viewpoint that occupied the far wall, gesturing at them to turn and look. The viewpoint, which had once shown a red alien sky and cloud, bathing the room in red light, now showed something in the distance. It looked like a tower, ringed by smaller towers sprouting around it like mushrooms, and---

\"Is that city floating?\" Asami asked, incredulously.

Azrael smiled slightly, flicking her nictating membrane back and forth over her eyes.

\"In a dense atmosphere, it\'s possible to float structures by simply filling them with less dense gas. It was a suggestion originally made for Venus, but our planet, which we named Terra Roja, was even more suited for the idea. It has a breathable atmosphere, despite the density, and an entire ecosystem in the upper atmosphere. The first colonists floated their giant colony ships and built outward, pulling asteroids into orbit to mine for materials. And...\"

Azrael paused, looking at them to make sure they were following the story, then continued:

\"And they engineered themselves wings. That was the point, you see. You can use airships, but everything is so much better with wings. Smaller bodies, lighter bones with connection ports and spines on the back to connect and nourish the biomechanical, powered wings, along with an outgrowth that you can connect a tail to. In a dense atmosphere, it was possible for even humans to fly with a little mechanical help. That was the vision.\"

She looked down at the floor, reciting an explanation she had practiced many times.

\"I was the third generation, and I was born with everything in place. They gave me a pair of wings and a tail extension when I was three, and I learned to fly.\"

She looked up, gesturing at the pair of feathered wings, and the fan, which Ryouko now realized was a *tail*.

\"They grow with you as you get older,\" she said, \"and you can use different extensions---feathers, no feathers, and so on, depending on what kind of aerodynamics you want. I can feel everything, and control everything with my spines. Organo‐mechanical, something Governance had never managed, because it never wanted to *try.* They were glad to take the technology when the time came, though. Last I heard, they were testing parts of it for the new TacComp iteration.\"

Ryouko felt an uneasy sense of surprise emanating from Clarisse, and didn\'t have to guess what it was about.

Asami sighed, shaking her head.

\"I don\'t expect you to understand, but it was *beautiful.* We built spires in the sky, giant towers, with thermal eddies everywhere, where you could fly for hours while barely trying. We did everything in flight---weddings, parties, you name it.\"

Azrael turned to look at the holographic projection, and Ryouko thought she saw her eyes glimmer with tears.

\"Our goddamn government wasn\'t stable,\" she said, peering at the spire in the hologram. \"The whole idea was that Governance would eventually find us, and we could introduce ourselves to the rest of humanity, and drive a revolution in ideology. But some crazy radicals thought we hadn\'t gone far enough. Why not grow the wings and tail naturally? Why have legs, when we barely use them and it just unbalances flight? A lot of us were disturbed by that.\"

She closed her eyes and shook her head.

\"It was so stupid,\" she said. \"There was a civil war. Do you have any idea what happens when you fire explosives at a city that\'s basically a giant balloon? It was a massacre.\"

She waved her hand, and the holographic wall switched to a different view, of a spire that was miniature in comparison, collapsed in on itself, ruined, the top broken off.

\"I was only fourteen,\" Azrael said. \"My parents were dead. Someone finally sent a distress call with our stored IIC system, but by the time Governance arrived, it was just me and a few others in that spire, a couple dozen in other small spires, and a few technicians in orbit.\"

Azrael pinned the two of them with an intense gaze.

\"We wanted to rebuild, of course,\" she said, \"but Governance wouldn\'t let us. They forced us to lose our wings, change back to baseline human, and keep everything a secret. Do you understand? It\'s all we ever knew our whole lives. I feel broken without my wings, and they wanted me to change back. And then, I met a small white animal.\"

\"An Incubator,\" Asami said, sounding breathless.

\"Yes,\" Azrael said. \"After I made my wish, Governance had a change of heart, of course. I could keep my wings, if I agreed to work for them as a scout on other colonies, after a bit of training. It didn\'t make much sense, not even for the MSY, even though I got telepathy as my main magic, but it was good enough for me. In retrospect, I regret not wishing for something bigger, but I was only a kid.\"

Ryouko looked down at her hands. What was she supposed to think of a story like that? She supposed the colony\'s founder had been in the wrong, doing something so obviously *wrong,* with disastrous consequences. But none of that was Azrael\'s fault, and it seemed terrible to try to force her to change back.

In the end, as repelled as she felt by the spines, they were a minor change. Nothing like the FA Elites.

\"Wow,\" she heard Asami said, and echoed the sentiment.

\"I don\'t like doing this,\" Azrael said. \"They use me to introduce new recruits to the whole rogue colony thing, because of the shock value. I get it. No one takes things seriously unless they see evidence. "

Ryouko looked up, to find Azrael smiling again, blushing.

\"It\'s also a bit of a test for you,\" Azrael said. \"I don\'t know how important you are to this mission, but if you really couldn\'t handle it, they\'d probably take you off the mission. I guess Marianne and Kyouko trust you. A lot of people respond really badly. I\'m just happy you two haven\'t fled the room. I *still* haven\'t found anyone willing to date me.\"

Ryouko chuckled nervously at the joke, unwilling to admit how affected she had been, and glad that Azrael, whose power list included telepathy, didn\'t seem to be reading her mind.

\"So there\'s a lot of rogue colonies, then?\" Asami asked, making a clear effort at normal conversation.

\"Yes,\" Azrael said. \"There\'s a lot of people like me out there. However, I have to admit, most of them don\'t have fond memories of where they used to live. I don\'t really like Governance, but I\'ve grown to appreciate the work I do.\"

\"Can you attach the wings?\" Asami asked. \"I\'d like to see it. I think they\'re cool.\"

Ryouko looked at her in surprise, and realized that Asami meant what she was saying, and even looked a little excited. She remembered, then, that Asami wanted to be a xenobiologist. Azrael was a little like an alien, after all.

\"Hey,\" Ryouko said, tapping Asami on the sleeve. \"Don\'t get carried away.\"

\"No, it\'s okay,\" Azrael, eyes wide with genuine surprise. \"I think it\'s cool, too. No one has ever actually asked.\"

Azrael stood decisively, pulling off her jacket. She turned around and pulled the bulkier pair of wings off of the wall, lifting the heavy object with surprising deftness and moving it behind her head.

Ryouko, who was expecting a simple locking mechanism, almost jumped when a set of metal manipulators sprouted out of the midbody of the wings, reaching for Azrael\'s back. She let go of the wings, which settled themselves into place, seeking out the spines and connection ports and attaching itself adroitly. A moment later, the rigid‐looking outer segments of the wings folded downward, bending and shaping itself around her with smoothness that was eerily organic.

Then, Azrael walked towards the wall with the hologram, pulling the metal \"fan\" off the wall and placing it on her back, where the same procedure repeated itself, though a little more awkwardly, due to the device having to reach into the back of her dress.

Azrael then turned around, massive wings and tail flexing to avoid hitting anything. The entire effect seemed a bit absurd, a relatively tiny girl hidden among giant wings and startlingly lengthy tail.

Azrael giggled slightly, hand to her mouth, apparently aware of the effect.

\"Yeah, I know it looks a little silly. I don\'t actually have magical flight, despite what my record says, so I had to grow both of these much bigger for thinner atmospheres, and I have different wing surfaces for different situations. It\'s all very complicated, and on a place like Earth I would have to wear a little antigrav device for stability. It feels stupid, so on break I go to Optatum. Nice thick atmosphere, giant geese I can hunt, though the eagles are annoying sometimes. I have a little cabin in the mountains. No people.\"

Ryouko blinked, startled at the girl\'s suddenly bright personality, but then Azrael frowned, looking between the two of them.

\"Do you two know why Nana and Kyouko are on this mission? I don\'t want to reveal any secrets.\"

Ryouko grimaced, looking at Asami---which turned out to be the wrong thing to do, because Asami had glanced at her, caught the grimace, and immediately realized that Ryouko knew what Azrael was talking about.

\"Hmm, well, let me show you a holo,\" Azrael said, glancing between the two of them.

The holoprojection on the wall behind her shifted again, this time not to a scene of an alien sky and clouds, but to an ordinary‐looking room. Framed in the center was Azrael, wearing her wings and tail---though with a white coloration---standing shyly next to a taller, smiling Akemi Homura, who had her own, similarly white wings on display, though hers were much smaller.

\"She came to visit me, right after my contract,\" Azrael said, turning to face the wall and inadvertently blocking much of the image with her wings. \"I was flattered that such a big shot would come talk to me, you know? And she has wings too! Even if they\'re a little different. It really made me feel a lot better about myself.\"

*I\'m looking for her, too,* Azrael thought, her voice echoing in Ryouko\'s mind. *I used to send her messages when I was depressed. I can\'t believe she just* left *like that.*

*I understand,* Ryouko replied.

\"Let me show you some other holos,\" Azrael enthused, waving her hand at the wall.

Ryouko and Asami shared a look.

*We\'re nearly out of time,* Ryouko thought. *We\'re supposed to go back to training soon. We should tell her.*

*I think she\'s really lonely,* Asami thought, shaking her head slightly. *I doubt she has any friends. Think about it.*

Ryouko did think about it, looking down at her hand. She remembered the wave of revulsion that had passed over her when she first saw the spines, and felt the lingering sting of guilt.

*Alright,* she thought. *We can stick around a little longer.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Get up.*

Clarisse\'s voice thundered into Ryouko\'s head, helping to jostle her awake from a fairly elaborate dream about flying. She found herself immediately alert and awake, typical of being woken up for an unexpected combat situation. She snapped her head around, looking for Asami, who, atypically, wasn\'t there.

Clarisse steadied her.

*It\'s fine. She\'s arguing with your mother over your decision to return to combat.*

Ryouko grimaced. Her mother was...

*What is this about, then?* she asked. *Is it the movie producers calling again? You really don\'t need to wake me---*

*No, of course not,* Clarisse thought, sounding annoyed. *Kyouko wants to see you immediately. I don\'t know why. Get dressed.*

Ryouko, who was already throwing on a shirt, felt the obvious questions winding their way through her mind. This clearly wasn\'t a general combat alert, Asami wasn\'t involved, Kyouko wanted just her...

She reached the doorway, kicking off her bunny slippers and sticking her feet into a pair of fancy boots Asami had bought her, allowing the straps to lock into place automatically around her ankles.

She turned and yelled towards Asami that she had an important reason to leave immediately, then shot out her doorway, heading for the transit elevator that would take her one deck up, to Kyouko\'s suite.

*She seemed to want you pretty quickly,* Clarisse thought, *but she\'s also apologetic about waking you up, so I wonder what it is.*

The trip was fast; it took only half a minute at most before she found herself stepping into Kyouko\'s cabin, finding the living area---identical to everyone else\'s---already occupied by Kyouko, Marianne, Nana, and---

She started, shocked at Mami\'s presence, before realizing that it was a hologram, as a cursory check of her infrared vision revealed clearly.

Mami was glowering, and it seemed to Ryouko that she was walking into a room that was already filled with tension.

\"Sorry for dragging you out of bed like this,\" Kyouko said, \"but since we were already meeting like this, we figured we might as well just get you to come up here instead of trying to set up the VR.\"

Ryouko tilted her head slightly, acknowledging the explanation but realizing that it didn\'t explain why she was here.

Kyouko spoke to her in Standard.

\"Ryouko, this is important,\" she said, pinning Ryouko with a look, "so please be honest. Explain to the others here about the vision you told me about, that one time with the Theological Council. We\'d rather not distribute recordings of the meeting, and it\'s all based on your word, anyway.\"

Ryouko, shocked, glanced around at the seated girls, feeling a pit gather in her stomach. While she certainly believed in the existence of a Goddess now, and also the veracity of her visions, she had never admitted as much publicly---the last thing she wanted was to tell Mami, her aunt, and Marianne about it.

Kyouko gave her a soft look.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said. \"But like I said, it\'s important, and it will be more convincing if you say it without prompting from me. You can be brief.\"

Ryouko closed her eyes, turning her head to one side to draw in a breath. She reminded herself that there had been moments in her life where she had been forced to buckle down and *do* something, and that she made it through all of them. The wormhole mission, for example. This was only a sideshow in comparison.

She raised her head back up, trying not to look Mami in the eye.

\"I was visited by the Goddess,\" she said, careful to speak about "the\" rather than \"a\" Goddess. \"She showed me a vision of a large group of magical girls on a cliff, under fire. Kyouko was there, and so were Shirou Asaka and Kishida Maki. We were attacked by a group of humans, who apparently had more weapons than they should have, and we were trying to evacuate into the ocean in a group of submarines. Kyouko was killed by laser fire from a submarine that shouldn\'t have been there.\"

She stopped, looking around at the reactions of the group of girls around her. All three of them, except for Kyouko, had gotten progressively more shocked, responding to phrases in Ryouko\'s explanation as if they were physically impactful.

Kyouko turned back to look at Mami, wearing a vaguely smug look but speaking carefully.

\"You see?\" Kyouko said. \"Everything is as I said. You can see why I\'m not hot on this submarine‐magical girl invasion force plan you\'ve got sketched out. I had my suspicions, but I was even more certain after hearing your plan. Something is wrong with that colony, and they\'re going to have more weapons than we expect, and the submarine thing isn\'t going to work out. We should also remove the people from the vision from the mission. Ryouko and I have to be here, but Asaka does not have to join. It\'ll be unusual, but we can reassign her at the last minute.\"

As Kyouko spoke, Mami gave her a look that was halfway between a glare and simple, deep‐seated dissatisfaction.

\"You\'re asking me to redesign this mission, because of a 'vision\'\"---and here Mami made physical air quotes with her hands---\"and also arguing that you should stay, when if this vision were true, clearly the easiest way to protect you would be to leave you at home.\"

Ryouko looked around awkwardly for a place to sit, finally squeezing in between Nana and Marianne when they made a space open.

\"We\'ve been over this,\" Kyouko said. \"We agreed if there\'s any chance of Homura being involved in this, I *have* to be here, because we\'re not getting you or Yuma to do this.\"

\"But it\'s really more the changing of plans---\"

\"It\'s not completely impossible to imagine that Ryouko and Kyouko here are right,\" Marianne said, glancing out of the side of her eye at Mami\'s holographic avatar. \"You were alive when precognitive magical girls such as Mikuni Oriko were still alive, and you Ancients still speak about intuition as if it is a real, useful thing. Is it that difficult to imagine that it might still be possible to view the future?\"

\"There are several alternate plans,\" Nana pointed, \"other than the submarines. And for something as important as this, I\'m sure the military can spare additional conventional forces. It doesn\'t have to be solely a magical girl operation.\"

Mami tilted her head, eyes closed, and Ryouko imagined that she could hear the field marshal gritting her teeth.

She opened her eyes again, fixing her gaze on Ryouko.

\"Alright, I\'ll allow it, though I\'m not happy with it. It is the reasonable thing to do. But, Shizuki‐san, is it true? Do you believe in this Goddess?\"

Ryouko sighed, looking down for a moment, then meeting Mami\'s gaze.

\"I do,\" she said. \"I\'ve seen her too many times not to.\"

Mami closed her eyes, seemingly about to say something, but then sighed and said:

\"Alright, then I think that will be all. I suppose the meeting is dismissed. I have to get going.\"

Mami vanished, leaving Ryouko to sit there with her hands clasped, thinking. It was no longer possible not to talk about these things, it seemed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stealth Surveillance Probe OBv4r1n3, also known as \"Miki\" or, to friends, \"Probe‐chan\", was not having a good week.

There was a certain pride associated with being the newest, latest model, especially when your predecessors were not quite as... sentient as you were. It had taken a lot of innovation and questionably organic modifications to cram an AI of 1H intelligence into the chassis of the Observer Version 4 Revision 1, and while Miki wasn\'t quite the prototype---that would be \"Proto‐chan\", who she really needed to call again when she got a chance---being number three was more than glamorous enough, and it had made her newborn heart swell with pride whenever a larger ship snuck by the shipyard to have a look and compliment her. Plus, being number three meant that she could go straight into combat duty, rather than having to endure multiple rounds of boring test‐runs, accompanied by occasional embarrassing---and, if the rumors were right, downright humiliating---glitches.

As a stealth surveillance probe, it was of course natural that she would spend long weeks alone in enemy territory under complete radio silence. That had been factored into her personality design, and while she did occasionally miss socialization, the hustle and bustle of a fleet gave her headaches, and long weeks of alone time were perfect to work on her poetry and her pre‐industrial style musical compositions. Both of those hobbies were programmed into all v4r1\'s and were of course intended to give them something time‐consuming and energy‐conserving to do, as well as to talk about on the rare occasions they met. For the really long trips, they could shut themselves down and allow a few autonomous subroutines to take care of transit, but that defeated the purpose of having a sentience always on the lookout for incoming sensor scans.

No, what really ground her gears was the mission she had been assigned. She was designed for high‐risk infiltration missions into heavily monitored alien systems, not leisurely junkets to minor colony worlds, rogue or not. It was the kind of mission one would give to one of the plentiful v3r12\'s, and that Command indeed *had* given to a Version 3. She had read those reports, and nothing in them suggested that this would be anything but stunningly routine---certainly, there was no reason for them to force her to cancel her inaugural performance to the Pre‐industrial Music Scholars\' Organization---PMSO, for short---and rush out to this uninspiring middle‐of‐nowhere colony in the Rhine Sector. Either Command wasn\'t telling her something or, more likely, they were just trying to keep her on her toes.

She sighed. Well, if there was one redeeming factor to this mission, it was that it was short. Two days in, two days out, and probably not much to do in between. She had allowed herself the mental rant, but she was already nearing the outer planets of the star system, and it was time to cut her FTL engines and approach the planet by sublight, just in case. She was nothing if not scrupulous, indeed obsessively so---that was another predetermined personality feature, very important in her line of work.

So she settled in for the hours‐long sublight approach, allowing herself to fall into a bit of a work trance, always monitoring her sensor feeds, always taking the least likely route to be scanned, even if she sincerely doubted that there would be any deep‐space sensor arrays capable of monitoring her approach.

Finally, she approached the planet, and could see the settlement on the planet\'s surface, neither unusually large nor particularly special in any way, just as the v3r12 had reported. She allowed herself another annoyed sigh, and played a bit of music in her mind to cheer herself up---Tchaikovsky, and honestly more appropriate for fleet combat than surface scanning, but she liked it.

She eschewed the easy geostationary orbits, moving in for a much closer, less‐predictable, and faster orbit. It was annoying having to watch the settlement constantly zooming by underneath her as she spun around the planet, but she was of course designed to ignore such things, and with the right compensation algorithms, she could almost pretend it wasn\'t happening.

She unveiled her passive sensor arrays, allowing them to soak in whatever photons they saw, and brought her other sensors, some of the most sensitive Governance could design, up to full operating power. It was a delicate dance, retransmitting photons to make sure her sensors didn\'t visibly occlude anything, and allowing waste heat to build up in her internals, to be dumped in occasional bursts of infrared directed away* from the planet, and only when she was on the opposite side of the planet. But it was her job, her life, and she stretched herself out to listen, letting herself fall into a trance, sitting together with the mountain, until only the mountain remained.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few hours later, she was quite awake, Li Bai be damned. Her gravity sensors indicated an underground structure buried beneath the colony, at least as large as the aboveground settlement, but at significant depth, and therefore agonizingly hard to gather any details about, no matter how patient she was about collecting individual photons and gravitational fluctuations.

She needed to weigh the tradeoffs. She could probably leave the planet now, her duty done, but the information she had was maddeningly incomplete---or, she could bring her active sensors online, risking detection and even perhaps the loss of the data entirely, if she were shot down. That would be disastrous, warning the colony that Governance was onto them, losing vital information, and, least importantly, getting her killed. Sure, her last consciousness backup had been just before she left, as was standard protocol, but like most ships she hoped to reach eventual obsolescence and retirement without any philosophically troubling gaps in her memory.

She did not even consider trying to transmit her data first, *then running an active scan, because that would gain her nothing---the IIC usage would be even more noticeable than the active scan, so if she were going to do that, she might as well scan to her heart\'s content.

She decided she\'d risk one active gravimetric scan. It was unlikely the colony would have anything that could detect her handiwork, and it was even more unlikely that anything could shoot her down.

She toggled the command, and if she had been human her eyes would have widened immediately. The data poured back into her sensors, and she interpreted the results hurriedly. An underground facility---no, an underground *colony,* several times larger than anything apparent on the surface. Geothermal power taps that suggested a disproportionate amount of power usage, facilities of a size and complexity to suggest a population that should not be possible given the history of the colony---

Besides being obsessively scrupulous, Miki was also designed not to be easily distracted by surprise; thus, even as she fervently sliced and diced the data and pondered the risk associated with another, more detectable active scan, a part of her kept on the watch for anomalies in surroundings, and noticed when a faint gravitational echo returned from elsewhere in orbit, tremendously far away by human standards but practically next door by orbital standards.

She fired her emergency thrusters, bright and obvious as this system\'s star, and the impacter missed her by a scant half‐kilometer. The game was up.

*They have orbital weaponry?* she thought incredulously, as she hurried away from the planet with only a passing glance at her attacker, entering FTL as fast as she was capable of.

She brought her IIC system fully online, the zero‐width wormhole in her belly screaming at her gravimetric sensors as she forced photons into it. Space‐time did not like being treated like that, and made sure everyone in the area was well aware of it, but the stealth no longer mattered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"So is the intervention force ready yet? The Directorate is not pleased with these unexplained delays.\"

Mami glanced up at the new arrival, turning away from the new set of maps she had been inspecting.

\"Well, it *was,*\" she said, peering into Military Affairs\'s oddly warm---but still clearly cyborg---eyes.

\"There have been some new developments, though,\" she said, turning back to the maps she and Yuma had been studying scrupulously, scraps of interactive paper laid out on a small, square table, set tall enough for them to stand at.

In truth, there wasn\'t much to see that wasn\'t already in the intelligence summary. The colony on the surface looked unremarkable, and everything of interest lay beneath the surface, in a fuzzily‐defined region given only the most tentative of labels. Something big was down there, something that required a lot of geothermal power, and... that was all they knew, really. There wasn\'t even really enough to make serious guesses about, and it was an open question why the colony bothered having an aboveground section at all. It seemed like they would have been better‐served hiding the whole colony underground, except that the aboveground structure had served to mislead the first probe they had sent---but why would the colony leaders think there was any need to mislead? The probe was only there, after all, because of the mysterious signal, whose origin was still unknown.

It made Mami uneasy to think about, but she had only sent the second probe because of the reasons she had been given for canceling the submarine route of attack. It was apparent now that Kyouko was right---the original planned deployment would have been utterly unequipped for assaulting a vast underground structure, magic or not.

But of course, then, there were the reasons for what Kyouko had believed---what *Ryouko* had believed. How seriously should she take Ryouko\'s \"vision\" involving the colonists having weapons? Was it all a coincidence, especially in light of the stealth probe coming under fire? Mami had always thought that Ryouko had too good a head on her shoulders to fall for that Cult nonsense, and yet...

\"As you can see,\" Mami said, as Military Affairs stepped over to see for himself. \"Recent scans of the colony have revealed that there is a good deal more to it than we previously thought. Moreover, with the recent detection of our probe, it is almost certain that the colonists, or whoever is out there, will now expect our arrival. Given the attempted destruction of the probe, I wouldn\'t assume a non‐hostile reaction.\"

That was hardly a comprehensive summary of the situation, Mami knew, but she also knew Military Affairs was already digesting the contents of the written report. This preliminary conversation was merely social courtesy.

\"Humph,\" he grunted, metal arm dropping onto the surface of the table with a clang. \"The others will not like this. There are too many unknowns here, and given this cult\'s professed beliefs, the only speculation I can have about what they are doing is all too dark. This exact kind of thing is why we established a monoculture in the first place.\"

Mami and Yuma shared a glance. The idea of a monoculture came up frequently in online criticism of Governance, and Governance never admitted that the phenomenon was an intended goal of its policies, rather than an unintended consequence. The current culture of Earth would be propagated through the sheer success of its society, and as long as cultural variance in the colonies was kept within certain bounds, Governance could rest assured that there were no dystopias or rival human governments festering within its official domain. Beyond that, rogue colonies were allowed a certain amount of unofficial leeway, as insurance against existential threats. Governance did not suffer them to get too perverse, though, or too dangerous.

It was not an idea to be spoken about openly, Mami thought, looking at Military Affairs, who was drinking from a wooden mug filled with some kind of frothy beer. This was a secret council, however, and if they couldn\'t talk about it now, when could they?

True discussion couldn\'t really start, though, until...

\"I\'m here!\" a cheery voice announced.

The green apparition emerged out of the ether on the unoccupied side of the table, slightly above ground level. The girl landed dramatically, bracing her arms against the table, long hair piling forward with the momentum.

\"You\'re late,\" Yuma said, glancing sidelong at MG.

\"Only by a few seconds,\" the girl insisted.

\"A few seconds, objective time,\" Yuma said.

\"It\'s fine, Miss Chitose,\" Military Affairs said, setting down his mug, which vanished into sparkles a moment later. \"Let the young be young.\"

Yuma shrugged, and MG tilted her head slightly, obviously processing the forwarded information for this meeting. It wasn\'t typical for both Yuma and MG to attend the same meeting, unless the number of participants was quite small.

\"Oooh,\" she chorused a moment later. \"I don\'t think the MSY is going to like what we find down there.\"

Mami leaned forward and pointed her gaze down at the maps on the table, making it clear with her body language that it was time for business.

\"Now that we\'re all up to speed,\" she said. \"One point of interest is that it will be necessary to substantially escalate the scale of force commitment. Command had hoped to limit the intervention force to mages only, so as to limit the spread of anything discovered on the colony, but a commitment of that scale in pure mages would now be too resource‐draining, especially in light of the apparent orbital defenses present at the colony. We have decided to commit conventional forces instead, and the opinion of Command is that if we\'re going to go there, we have to go big. Cruisers, artillery, orbital‐based air power---but especially large numbers of infantry and tunneling drones. Assaulting what we must assume is an underground fortification is properly an infantryman\'s job.\"

She glanced around at the others, gauging their reactions. Nothing yet, except the usual serious expressions.

\"There are, of course, veteran units with experience in colonial interventions,\" she said. \"Task Force Rhamnusia, in particular, is specialized for this task. We will include them, but we do not believe they have sufficient force to rapidly sweep an underground fortification against resistance, if it comes to that, especially given their lack of training in underground operations. Therefore, Command seeks to assign additional forces, whatever the risk to operational secrecy.\"

Mami glanced around again, particularly at Military Affairs, whose approval was most necessary.

\"This seems rather paranoid,\" Military Affairs said, frowning slightly. \"Indeed, the colony has shown unexpected capabilities, but the type of commitment you are describing is unprecedented for a colonial intervention. Task Force Rhamnusia was assembled specifically to cover all possible contingencies. As for sweeping underground fortifications, outside of the special forces, no one has *that particular type of training, because we have not yet found the need to assault a fortified world.\"

\"This is not a foreseen contingency,\" Yuma said, looking at Military Affairs. \"You must admit that a colony of this sort was not anticipated to exist.\"

\"The MSY\'s experience with unknown situations involving magic shows that paranoia is really the order *du jour,*\" MG supported. \"I would not be worried about the Ordo Illustrata per se, but if they\'ve indoctrinated any new magical girls, or conducted any other sort of experimentation, it is best we move in with maximal firepower.\"

Military Affairs glanced at the relatively young AI with an odd expression.

\"With all due respect,\" he said, nodding his head in their direction, "the MSY has never been exactly clear about the possible limits experimentation* can be taken to. We have little doubt that the organization has not been exactly straightforward on the matter. We do not desire to contest this at the moment, but if it is simply the case that the danger here is greater than we can know to expect, then say so explicitly, and I will withdraw my objection.\"

\"It is more than you can know to expect,\" Mami replied. \"Similarly, Command does not believe that negotiations before intervention are warranted. We hope to achieve as much tactical surprise as possible. It will take a few additional days to gather the suggested amount of force, but we judge it unlikely that the rogue colony will be able to enact significant preparations in such a short period.\"

Mami hoped that her careful wording, conflating High Command with the MSY---who did indeed now compose a large portion of High Command---would get the conversation back on topic.

\"Very well,\" Military Affairs said, closing his eyes and stroking his slight beard. \"I do not believe the rest of the Directorate would necessarily approve of skipping the negotiation phase, but I will trust that *Command* knows what it is doing.\"

The AI glanced between the other three.

\"Will that be all?\" he asked.

\"Yes,\" Mami said. \"Unless you want to discuss operational details.\"

\"I will leave that to the military,\" Military Affairs said, getting up from the table. \"It\'s not my place. Just don\'t cock it up.\"

Having made explicit his position, he turned to leave, stopping only when MG touched his arm, the two AIs exchanging virtual eye contact---and presumably, some other form of communication.

Then they both vanished, and Yuma sighed loudly.

\"He\'s right, Mami,\" Yuma said, shaking her head. \"Maybe it\'s nothing and we\'re all overreacting, but I don\'t think this situation augurs well. I don\'t have to tell you that. Don\'t cock it up. Minimal casualties, both sides, if possible.\"

\"If possible,\" Mami said, turning her head away. They both knew that the history of colonial interventions was checkered, especially when it came to casualties.

Then she signed off.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"And so it seems like we\'ve earned ourselves a bit of a delay, as it will take some time for the necessary reinforcements to gather here on San Giuseppe,\" Kyouko announced to the auditorium, standing next to a holographic reconstruction of the planet\'s surface with Nana and Marianne. \"The closest units are already here; be sure to welcome them. We will be assigning additional training regimens for those of you who are least experienced, but I think a half‐day of free time right now would not be unwarranted. Dismissed.\"

The crowd of magical girls began getting up to leave, murmuring in disturbed conversation. It had been unusual for Kyouko to call a full, physical briefing like this, and the speculation had been intense. Once they had all gathered on San Giuseppe, they were supposed to board a cruiser bound for the mysterious colony; instead it seemed they would wait on the planet a bit longer for even more force to gather.

\"I wouldn\'t say we exactly *earned* a delay,\" Ryouko heard a girl behind her say. \"I\'d prefer an easy mission with no breaks to a hard one with a *week* of vacation.\"

\"I think we all would,\" another girl said. \"But it\'s not like we have a choice. Free time is free time.\"

\"Free time, huh?\" Ryouko said.

Asami looked at her, and for a moment Ryouko was quite certain of what "free time\" would be spent doing.

Then Ryouko heard the ping of an incoming message, and tilted her head to read it. It wouldn\'t have drawn her attention if Clarisse didn\'t think it was important for her to read.

> 〈*In the following text,* 〈〉① *indicates content redacted to those without security clearance. The number indicates the degree of security clearance required to access enclosed content.*〉①

> Hi again!

> I just got a surprise reassignment to a new mission. 〈Apparently, they think someone with earth manipulation powers will be useful---something about an underground bunker or something.〉⑤‡ But anyway, I\'m sure I don\'t need to tell you guys about that; it looks like we\'re on the same assignment!

>
> Zhou Meiqing
>
> 〈**Access to sections marked ‡ restricted to a limited number of individuals.**〉‡

This was a surprise indeed, and Ryouko glanced over at Asami, who she assumed had gotten the same message.

Indeed, Asami\'s brow was knitted as she read the message, before she relaxed, shaking her head glumly.

\"Come on, there\'ll be other chances,\" Ryouko said, patting her girlfriend on the back. \"I\'m sure you\'ll think of a way to slip away. Whatever we\'re doing, we should invite Azrael.\"

Asami looked up at her.

\"You think?\" she said.

\"I think it might be interesting.\"

Asami nodded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Hiking, huh,\" Azrael said, peering skeptically at the path laid out in front of them, dirt trail leading into a dense grove of alien trees. It looked... almost like Earth, except for the giant ferns interspersed within the forest, and the brilliant red vines that climbed many of the trees, displaying luscious scarlet‐red fruit. This \"bloodfruit\" was quite popular on San Giuseppe, despite the common knowledge that they would have been absurdly poisonous without toxin‐neutralizing implants. Asami had, of course, told her all about it long before they even got to the trailhead.

Ryouko understood the skepticism in Azrael\'s voice. Knowing what she knew of Azrael\'s life story, she doubted the girl had walked more than five hundred meters in her life, and probably stayed out of forests, which were nasty areas to try to fly in when you had a wingspan measured in meters. Azrael had still insisted on carrying her wings with her, but they were so outrageously bulky that, in the end, the only recourse was for Azrael to simply wear them, so she could control what they were doing. Meiqing was told that the detachable wings were the result of a wish, which she accepted readily enough.

Meiqing was also the one who had suggested going hiking. According to the tour guide, San Giuseppe had some breathtaking rock formations, and by climbing to the top of one of them just before nightfall, it was possible to see some truly breathtaking auroras.

Ryouko sighed, kicking the ground with one boot. Listening to tourist brochures could get one into strange situations, if getting kissed by Asami in a volcanic hot springs was indicative of anything. Perhaps that was why her girlfriend had agreed with the hiking idea so readily. Or perhaps it was simply the girl\'s xenobiologist proclivities showing.

\"Come on,\" Asami yelled, from in front of them. She had decked herself out fully for the trip, complete with walking stick, hat, and massive backpack, when realistically with their enhancements and magic, they could have hiked in the nude and been perfectly fine. It wouldn\'t have surprised Ryouko if Asami had a portable laboratory kit in that backpack.

Meiqing carried only some light provisions, and was otherwise dressed similarly to Ryouko and Azrael. She smiled slightly, gesturing at them to get on the trail already.

Ryouko shrugged, glancing at Azrael, and then stepped forward, walking onto the light red soil of San Giuseppe\'s forests.

She stopped a moment later, confronted by Asami\'s hand, which was offering her one of the dreaded bloodfruits.

Ryouko faked a smile, and took it into her hand, biting down into the fruit, knowing that the blood‐red fruit dripping out made her look like some kind of carnivore, as it did Azrael, who was doing the same.

It... wasn\'t bad. An interesting blend of sour and sweet and bitter, it worked her way down her taste buds. She also knew the bite she had just taken could have killed multiple unenhanced horses.

\"Oh, look, it\'s a starbird!\" Asami exclaimed, pointing up at red and black bird flapping through the air on four wings.

The bird stopped on a tree branch and Asami peered at it intently, clearly taking a zoomed‐in picture.

Azrael looked at Ryouko, as if to ask: Is she always like this?

*Yes, she\'s always like this,* Meiqing thought, answering the question before Ryouko could. *I think it\'s endearing, though.*

*It is, a little,* Ryouko agreed. *She gets so excited.*

Azrael sighed slightly, trudging along the trail.

*I usually ignore small birds like that. I like to kill giant geese and annoy the eagles. It\'s good fun. But right now I envy that bird.*

Azrael shook her head at herself, walking ahead of Meiqing and Ryouko. Asami was by now far ahead.

Meiqing halted midtrail.

\"What does she mean by that? She hunts geese?\"

\"She flies a lot,\" Ryouko said, passing Meiqing on the trail. \"It\'s her whole life, basically. Come on, don\'t lag behind.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Simple\" hiking, under excellent conditions on clear trails, without any rock climbing or other difficulties thrown in, was mostly a leisure activity, a way to kill time gawking at scenery without straining oneself too hard. Even with the moderate incline it took them little effort to maintain a brisk pace, although they stopped frequently to take pictures of various fauna with their ocular implants. Even without their military implants or their magic they would have done fine---the hike was designed for civilians, and modern humans had little to fear.

On the way thus far, they had seen five different types of four‐winged bird, what looked like a mini‐pterodactyl, several colorful lizards, and the affectionately‐termed \"bear‐deer\", which looking startlingly like a bear but was in fact a rather large herbivore. Ryouko knew this because Asami had grabbed her by the arm to point out each and every one of these encounters. In truth, Ryouko was not terribly interested, but she could see the stars in Asami\'s eyes, and knew not to say anything. That, and Clarisse kept reminding her to \"just go with it.\"

So she did.

Gradually, even Azrael seemed to get into the mood, starting to comment on the odd dynamics four‐winged flight must produce, and how it was really only optimal on insects, though she could see how it might help with the placement of the center of gravity. According to her, San Giuseppe must have had an odd evolutionary history. Meiqing, for her part, opined that the forest soil was probably too cakey to use easily as a shield.

*To each their own, I suppose,* Ryouko thought.

*Azrael keeps staring at your back,* Asami thought, sidling up next to Ryouko, for a moment finally sated with bird‐watching.

*What?* Ryouko thought, suppressing the urge to glance back.

*Yeah, and she keeps blushing,* Asami thought. *I think she has a thing for you. Kind of weird, considering her age compared to everyone here.*

*You think* everyone *has a thing for me,* Ryouko thought. *Stop being so protective.*

*She\'s looking at Asami too,* Meiqing thought, surprising Ryouko, who hadn\'t noticed that Asami was sending her telepathy to both of them.

*What?* Asami thought.

*Though Ryouko\'s back mostly, yes,* Meiqing thought. *Maybe she has a thing for exposed backs?*

Ryouko suppressed the urge to pull down self‐consciously at her shirt.

*You\'re the one who bought me this thing,* she thought, glaring at Asami. *And insisted I wear it.*

*It looks cute!*

*It\'s too small!*

*It\'s supposed to be small!*

\"You\'re missing the view!\" Azrael yelled, from somewhere behind them.

They turned to look, and found Azrael standing on a scenic outcrop they had missed, leaning on the handrails to peer at something.

They scurried back to join her, finding that as they stepped off the trail towards the outcrop the trees thinned dramatically, revealing---

They were now on the edge of a steep drop‐off, beneath which it was possible to see the top of the forest arrayed on the plain below them. The primal arboreal wilderness stretched off to the distant horizon, accentuated by the nearly‐setting sun in front of them. At regular intervals, the flat ground was broken by a towering mesa similar to the one they were climbing, smooth at the top, with patches of vegetation on the side, as well as the occasional cave. Birds of prey circled in the air in front of them.

It was breathtaking, causing Ryouko to remember some paintings she had seen online, rather than real life.

Next to her, Asami gasped involuntarily.

\"You know, there are people who think San Giuseppe used to be occupied by a sentient alien race,\" Meiqing said, leaning onto the handrail herself. \"It said so in the online brochure. No one is sure how these rock formations were made, so there\'s some who think it was artificial.\"

\"If it\'s artificial, then the makers had wings,\" Azrael said, leaning forward over the bright permasteel rails. \"Mesas like this are natural spires, and I can feel the thermals they must make.\"

Before any of them could stop her, she vaulted over the railing, dashed to the edge of the cliff and dove off backwards, dropping shockingly fast before reappearing in front of them, wings not even flapping in the air current.

*Haha, I knew these would come in handy! I\'ll see you girls at the top, if you ever make it there!*

And then she was off, spinning in the air, her human form turning into a small dot in the blink of an eye.

\"Well,\" Meiqing said, finally, a full ten seconds later. \"Is she always like that?

\"That sounded like a challenge,\" Asami said decisively, looking at the two of them. \"Let\'s go.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite Asami\'s and Azrael\'s assertions, they did not in fact rush to the top of their mesa, still stopping to take in the scenery, and Azrael rejoined them just before they reached the peak, complaining that they were slow. Meiqing countered with the assertion that with a little magic she could have ridden the ground itself to the top, and Asami pointed out that she could ignore gravity if she chose to.

Ryouko decided not to point out she could have gotten to the top faster than any of them.

They found themselves sitting on benches in front of the endless plain before them, mesas sticking out of the ground like so many stools, broken only by the end of the forest to their right, where the woodland transitioned into grassland, then into the distant urban center they had come from, whose glow imprinted itself on the sky. The sun was beginning to set, and above them, where the twilight was turning into night, the sky was beginning to be riven by the promised aurora, bright green, red, and purple, a consequence of one of the star\'s frequent geomagnetic storms, whose forecasting was paid for by the planet\'s tourism industry.

\"I\'m surprised no one else is here,\" Ryouko said.

\"There\'s paths to all the mesas,\" Meiqing said. \"When you set out, they deliberately allocate it so that the visitors are spread out evenly. With the war, there\'s not very many tourists anymore, so it\'s mostly locals.\"

\"I might get a summer house here,\" Azrael said thoughtfully.

They sat there for a little while, watching as the sun---which seemed a little brighter than Earth\'s sun---slowly dipped into the horizon. The streams of light passing through the sky brightened and shifted wondrously, and Ryouko watched, entranced. She was not terribly fond of animals or the wilderness, but *this*---this she could get behind.

Then, when the sun had finally vanished below the curved edge of the world, Asami grabbed her by the hand, pulling her away from the stone benches they had sat on. Ryouko looked back to see if the others would follow, but saw instead Meiqing meeting her gaze, shaking her head slowly.

The air was beginning to fill with an undeniable chill, and though she could shrug it off easily, it contrasted sharply with the warmth of Asami\'s touch, which felt hot in her grasp.

\"Ah, to be honest,\" she managed to say, as she allowed herself to be pulled closer to the edge of the mesa. \"I would feel a little embarrassed out here, with the two of them back there---\"

\"This isn\'t about *that,*\" Asami interjected, sounding deliberately offended. \"I just wanted to get a better view.\"

\"Oh.\"

Silently, Asami pulled her through a small grove of stunted trees clinging to the top of the mesa, until they were at the very edge of the mountain. Here there were no handrails, and one small step would send either of them into the abyss.

\"Okay, I admit, this *also* makes me a little nervous,\" Ryouko admitted, peering over the edge.

\"Oh, come on, both of us have plenty of ability to save ourselves if we fell,\" Asami exhorted. \"Let\'s sit.\"

Asami set the example by dropping to the ground, neatly placing her legs over the edge. She raised an arm to Ryouko, offering.

Ryouko smiled sardonically, taking the offered hand, and taking her own seat at the edge of the abyss, next to Asami.

For a moment they sat there, hand‐in‐hand, and then Asami used her other hand to turn Ryouko\'s head towards her, and kissed her full on the lips.

Ryouko took a moment, eyes closed, feeling Asami stroking the back of her neck, then pulled back, gasping slightly.

\"I thought this wasn\'t about that,\" she said.

\"It\'s not,\" Asami said. \"I wanted to talk.\"

*Ah,* Ryouko thought.

She wasn\'t sure she liked the sound of that. It sounded ominous.

Asami looked out over the void in front of them, the forest below them now dark and menacing, even in the light of the storms above them.

\"I\'m scared, Ryouko. I don\'t know how else to put it. I\'m scared of what Kyouko‐san was talking about, this mysterious colony we\'re supposed to secure. I\'m scared of what we\'ll find there, and I\'m scared... I\'m scared of dying.\"

Ryouko watched Asami\'s face, and for once the girl did not look at her.

\"Well, the Goddess---\" Ryouko began.

\"I\'m not afraid of what comes after death,\" Asami interrupted quietly. \"Of course I\'m glad we apparently have a cushy afterlife to go to. But what kind of afterlife? Do you know? Whatever it is, it doesn\'t matter. I don\'t want to go yet. I\'m scared of missing out on life.\"

Asami grabbed her hand again, meeting her eyes.

\"Moments like this, worlds like this, kisses, and yes, you know. All of it. I feel as if we have a whole life to live, and I want to experience all of it, whatever we can. We have eternity, Ryouko---it\'s like Governance says: billions of our ancestors are buried under the dirt, without the chance we have. But now, I feel like, by going on these missions we\'re going to throw it all away.\"

Ryouko closed her eyes, then looked away.

\"Why are you here then? You didn\'t have to come; I told you.\"

\"Weren\'t you paying attention?\" Asami snapped. \"I said *we. We.*** Not *I.*\"

Ryouko\'s girlfriend grabbed her by the shoulders, pinning her with a look again.

\"Do you know how much it makes my blood run cold, knowing how much you\'re willing to risk your life? How cavalier you view all of this? I know you now. I know you\'d lay your life on the line willingly, for a chance at glory, for a chance to see something new, for a chance to save humanity---or even just one person. You know what the Goddess called you? A *hero.* Her words, not mine.\"

Asami looked down.

\"I knew then, if I hadn\'t known already, that I could never tie you down, not on Eurydome, not anywhere. I knew I\'d have to follow you. So here I am, trying to follow you into the breach, and I\'m *scared, Ryouko. I\'m scared of dying, I\'m scared of *you* dying, and it feels so selfish.\"

Asami sucked in a breath, and Ryouko realized the girl was crying, just a little.

\"Is it love, like in the storybooks?\" Asami asked. \"I don\'t know. But it\'s *something.* I don\'t want to tell you this, because I\'m scared that we don\'t match. You seem so much happier now, but in my heart I feel cold. I don\'t know if we can last.\"

\"Hey,\" Ryouko interrupted, reaching over and wiping at the other girl\'s tears with her hand, wonder what she was going to say. \"Don\'t be like that. I can\'t---\"

She looked down, at the small gap that lay between them, and realized that, fundamentally, Asami was right. They *didn\'t* match. Not as they were now. Ryouko wouldn\'t be happy one way, and Asami wouldn\'t be happy the other. It was---

\"I don\'t know,\" Ryouko said, looking up at Asami. \"Who can honestly say if they know? But I think that, for now, it is better to live the moment. *Carpe Diem,* as they say. Perhaps we will die soon, or perhaps not. Perhaps one of us will find it unbearable and break it. There\'s no sense in worrying about it so much. And people change. Maybe one day, we will wake up, and we\'ll find that we\'re happy. If you want to live life, then let\'s live it. Let\'s see where it goes.\"

Asami looked down at the forest below, sucking in a breath, and Ryouko watched her for a long moment.

\"What is the afterlife like?\" Asami asked finally, voice quiet. \"I know you\'ve spoken to the Goddess plenty of times. How is it?\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Ryouko said, shaking her head. \"I\'ve never seen it.\"

She thought back to her visions, to a misty white sky, an ethereal garden, a Goddess who seemed both old and young. She thought of Alice, returned from the dead to speak with Asaka one last time.

\"I think it\'s timeless,\" she said, looking up at the aurora in the sky above them. \"That\'s the impression I get. Eternity in a moment, like, uh, Saint Augustine. But human, somehow. Are the dead living somewhere? Are they in stasis? I don\'t know, but it didn\'t seem sorrowful.\"

Asami nodded, slowly.

\"Maybe it\'s pleasant,\" she said. \"But I\'d like to live my life before I have to go to that.\"

Ryouko nodded, then turned to watch the abyss below them.

\"*Carpe Diem,* huh?\" Asami echoed airily.

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko said.

She felt Asami grab her by the arm and knew what was happening, even before she was pulled down, and Asami had rolled over her, pushing them away from the edge of the cliff. She acquiesced, as she always did.

*I hope the other two are polite enough not to switch into infrared, Ryouko thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*So, uh, it\'s been a really long time,* Azrael thought, from far away. And we were kind of wondering if it was safe to come over now.*

*Go ahead,* Asami responded instantly. *It\'s not like we\'re doing anything.*

It was technically true, now.

A short while later, they heard the shuffling sound of Azrael and Meiqing making their way over to them. Watching them approach, Ryouko felt a slight twinge of jealousy---Azrael had her wings folded in front of the two of them, acting as a windbreak, and it looked oddly appealing, given how cold Ryouko had ended up.

Ryouko and Asami got up from their seated positions, walking over to meet them.

\"I guess it\'s about time we headed back, right?\" Asami asked, stretching her arms upward as if having just gotten up from a nap.

\"I suppose so,\" Azrael said, glancing up at the sky, where the aurora still gleamed brightly, far more splendid than anything on Earth. "Despite everything, we were always still a diurnal race. Nighttime flying was always a little crazy, and it gets pretty damn cold up in the air at night.\"

Ryouko and Asami shared a look, whose meaning Azrael caught immediately, adding:

\"Ah, no it\'s okay, I told Meiqing here all about it. If she\'s on the mission, she\'s approved to learn about it, though I\'m supposed to limit the spread of the information.\"

The girl scratched the back of her head nervously, then turned away, leading the way back. Meiqing followed immediately, and the others followed a moment later, shrugging.

\"Well, I guess if we\'re going to, uh, hang out, I\'ve got to say a few things,\" Azrael said, without turning to look back at them. \"I mean, it\'s not really typical for someone my age to be walking around with teenagers, so I\'m surprised you\'d even think to offer.\"

Ryouko and Asami glanced at each other, and Ryouko gestured with her head, indicating Asami should speak.

\"Well, honestly, we just thought we\'d be, you know, nice---\" Asami began.

\"I know,\" Azrael interjected. \"You did nothing wrong. I am a bit of a loner, as you might have gathered. And I haven\'t really done much with my life outside of these colony missions. I was pretty devastated when Homura disappeared and all that.\"

Azrael cleared her throat.

\"Anyway, I\'m stalling for time. There\'s no delicate way to put this, but I\'m going to have to, uh, ask you to not to wear back‐revealing clothing around me. The truth is, for my people, the back is a bit of an erogenous zone, and we kept it covered or hidden under wings at all times. Over the years, I\'ve gotten used to showing it to people, but I still can\'t help staring. It\'s awkward and I don\'t like going out much because of it, but since we\'re friends, I thought I would mention it.\"

Ryouko had started grimacing, pulling down self‐consciously on her shirt. This was the last time she would let Asami talk her into wearing something new.

\"I\'m sorry,\" Ryouko began, not sure what else to say. \"We didn\'t think---\"

\"No, of course it\'s not your fault,\" Azrael interrupted. \"I---\"

She paused, and a moment later Meiqing leaned over to her ear and whispered something, grabbing the other girl\'s shoulder reassuringly.

Azrael sighed.

\"Well, the other half of it is, I\'ve never really had a relationship because my people weren\'t wired to find standard humans attractive. You\'ve probably noticed I look pretty small by your standards. For us, because of how the aerodynamics work, the males and females were always really similar, and quite small. Honestly, I only ever... well, the MHD psychiatrist thinks it might be good for me to get some special friends---doesn\'t have to be anything serious---since I\'ve always been so lonely, but I\'ve always been too embarrassed, and---\"

Azrael sucked in a breath.

\"Well, I thought I\'d share,\" she said.

For a moment there was silence, and Ryouko found herself confused as how to interpret anything about the conversation. It made sense, but...

*She must be deathly embarrassed,* Ryouko realized and, switching to infrared, found that Azrael was indeed blushing tremendously.

Asami, however, surprised Ryouko by hurrying forward to stand next to Azrael, dodging around the girl\'s wings as they approached the trail to head back down the mountainside.

\"I think I understand,\" Asami said, \"and I\'m not sure what to say. What do you do with your free time?\"

\"Well, I spend a lot of time in simulations flying. I go to Optatum when I can. I don\'t really...\"

Ryouko allowed her attention to the conversation to lapse. Azrael was an anomaly, forced to live her life in a culture that didn\'t understand or support her. However, in the end, Ryouko supposed she wasn\'t much different. She had never felt like she fit in on Earth, didn\'t feel like she fit in now. And despite Asami\'s enthusiasm, Ryouko still could not honestly say that she felt any real sexual attraction to her or anyone else. It was not something she understood.

Well, it wasn\'t fair to draw any comparisons between her and Azrael.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fleet that appeared above the skies of the planet with the colorful military designation X‐25 was, in the grand scheme of the war, a piddling thing. A few dozen cruisers, accompanied by only a few dozen escort frigates, a few squadrons of interceptors, and a single Magi Cæli squad---far less than typical for the number of cruisers involved.

By the standards of what was necessary to seize and occupy a small rogue colony, it was, of course, undoubtedly exorbitant.

That the colony had orbital sensors was clear from their earlier experience with the stealth probe. It would be impossible to conceal the approach of a fleet of their size, so no attempt was made to. They decelerated into orbit behind an advance wave of orbital superiority drones, which made short work of the colony\'s carefully concealed orbital platforms before the larger ships even arrived.

These larger ships went immediately to work, the dropships and surface‐rated frigates of Task Force Rhamnusia already dropping out of hangers and heading for the planet, behind a descending wave of drones and ODASC planes. Satellites and orbital platforms spilled out of automated launch‐bays, mechanical eyes focused on the surface below.

Task Force Rhamnusia, the experts in the task at hand, was taking point, in the clear hope that additional force would be unnecessary. This additional force was held partially in reserve, even as the rest of it prepared for atmospheric entry.

This hope was not borne out; the initial air units encountered significant anti‐aircraft fire and drones, far beyond the range of what any reasonable estimate might have predicted, and began even to take a few casualties. The colonists had armed themselves to the teeth, with weapons of disturbing sophistication.

With reluctance that could be sensed in the tenor of the relayed command, the commander of the overall task force, the two‐century‐old Pavel Albescu, ordered in the orbital reinforcements. It was likely that the initial landing forces could still sweep the surface colony with ease, but the mandates of the operation were not only victory and ease, but also lightning speed and as many captives as possible, not just corpses on the ground.

There was, of course, also the matter of the underground.

Ryouko watched it all play out on the viewscreen walls of her landing frigate. She had been assigned with Kyouko and a few others as part of a pure magical girl shock group, one of the last groups that would be sent planetside.

The surprise that had struck the fleet when the initial resistance was encountered was palpable, despite what the mission briefing had implied, but it did not surprise Ryouko.

\"I guess we\'ll be going in after all,\" a dark blonde mage named Elisa Alistair said, watching the screen together with Ryouko. \"Well, I can\'t say I wouldn\'t like a go at these religious buggers, but I don\'t like the idea of fighting civvies.\"

Ryouko nodded noncommittally.

\"I\'ve never had a chance to fight underground,\" Meiqing said. \"It should be totally my thing.\"

\"*Please return to the passenger area and strap in for atmospheric entry,*\" the frigate AI thought, causing the small gaggle of magical girls to shuffle with varying degrees of haste to their seats, where Kyouko, Nana, and Marianne already waited, too senior to mingle openly with the others without seeming undignified.

Ryouko tried to relax, allowing the straps of her seat to clasp themselves around her.

She felt a reassuring squeeze on her hand; Asami smiled at her, and she smiled back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Firestorm.*

There was probably no other real way to describe an orbit‐to‐ground assault against a fortified position, Ryouko thought.

The principles hadn\'t really ever changed, not since the first group of swordsmen had charged the first row of spikes. One on one, the defender would always win. Offense required overwhelming force and overwhelming speed.

That was the case here as well, she thought, letting out a breath, watching in her mind\'s eye the stream of units and weaponry literally falling onto the surface: per minute, two thousand personnel, twelve thousand drones, a hundred armored vehicles, forty artillery pieces.

She tried to picture how it must look on the surface, how it *had* been in some of the simulations, landing on the surface along with a wave of shock troops and other magical girls, either traveling by teleport or streaking out of the sky. It had been heart‐pounding, engulfed in the storm of projectiles, artillery roaring, planes and Aer Magi zooming by, all while being expected to rush forward to the front immediately, under cover of a hailstorm of one‐way dropships already firing their main cannons.

But she knew that wasn\'t how this was going to go. Traveling with Lieutenant General* Sakura Kyouko, she\'d be among the last to descend, onto a surface that should be already pacified.

Even by those standards, it would still be anticlimactic. There would be no drop tubes for them, no diving out of the belly of the ship into the bitter, treacherous wind, trusting their magic to manage their landing. Instead, doctrine stated that in an opposed planetary landing, the teleporters should be distributed among the descending frigates as broadly as possible, which would not attempt surface deployment at all---the onboard teleporters would carry the occupants to the surface once the ships had descended far enough. Ryouko would simply teleport them the rest of the way---not a full two hundred kilometers, but something she could do more easily, around forty.

When the time came, then, she didn\'t find herself under enemy fire, or even near any other kind of fire. Instead, she found herself in the middle of a quiet, small alleyway, between two squat, unaesthetic‐looking buildings, typical of newly founded colonies without Governance support. With her was the rest of the roughly dozen girls assigned to Kyouko, among them Asami, Nana, Azrael, Marianne, Gracia, and Meiqing. It was an odd mixture of inexperienced girls and behind‐the‐lines personnel, intended more as Kyouko\'s mobile staff than an actual combat unit; the more experienced, combat‐prepared girls had landed much earlier.

They immediately arranged themselves in a colorful array on both sides of the alleyway, three of the girls using the walls to jump to the rooftop above. Elisa had already thrown up a barrier that completely enveloped the area.

Again, doctrine---just as Ryouko was Kyouko\'s designated teleporter, Elisa was her designated barrier generator. Doctrine was also why Command had told Ryouko to land in a small area with cover, rather than inside a building---the region was not fully secure, and experience had shown that recently captured bunkers sometimes exploded and collapsed, even when they seemed clear of booby traps. Better safe than sorry, and landing in an alleyway under the umbrella of a barrier generator was more than safe enough.

At both ends of the alleyway four sentries already stood guard, armored suits brilliant white to match the walls of the building, which reflected the bright midday sun shining directly down upon them. A few native vines had crawled tenaciously up the wall Ryouko and Kyouko stood against. They smelled oddly fragrant. In the distance, the quiet high‐frequency staccato of gunfire was punctuated by the occasional loud zap of tank fire.

\"Sir,\" the officer next to one of the sentries acknowledged, saluting briskly with metallic armored hand. With the passive informational awareness typical of combat, Ryouko knew immediately that it was Colonel Raul Santos, XVII Armored Division, Nile Sector Operational Reserve. Not part of Task Force Rhamnusia, who was storming the entrances into the underground complex, but reserves summoned to increase the manpower of this invasion. Typically, colonels were high enough in rank to merit their own fortified bunker, but this was a special circumstance.

\"I thought this area was secure?\" Kyouko said, gesturing at the sentries, who were watching the main road, weapons ready. Her tone was firm, adult, and commanding in a way Ryouko had never heard, and indeed incongruous emerging from her current form.

\"It is,\" Colonel Santos said, voice emanating from his suit\'s speakers. \"But better safe than sorry. These civilians put up a lot more fight than they were supposed to. We\'ve taken a number of casualties. Plus, apparently the place was infested by, ah, demons. And with this business with the clairvoyants not being able to see what\'s going on underground, we\'re very nervous.\"

Immediately after landing, several pre‐chosen clairvoyants had immediately tried to tap into events underground, as a matter of tactical priority. They had... been unable to see anything except a few abandoned corners of the facility, and it was possible they were being jammed magically, which was not unheard of.

\"Indeed,\" Kyouko said. \"It is very disturbing, but we\'ll have to deal with things as they come. Where are your bodyguards?\"

\"Supporting the rest of the regiment against a fortified complex. We don\'t have many mages, and these colonists don\'t seem as resourceful as the squid, so I figured these sentries would be enough.\"

They had heard about the demons and clairvoyants during the descent, of course, as they had everything else about the battle. They had even discussed it among themselves. A colony such as this should have had at least a few contracted magical girls, even if none had been on the original colony expedition. The invasion force had expected to encounter some resistance from such girls---and yet none had appeared. The common theory was that they were underground.

\"Is there something wrong?\" Kyouko asked, surprising Ryouko out from her brief reverie. She realized she had missed part of the conversation.

\"Permission to speak freely?\" Colonel Santos said.

\"Granted.\"

\"Is this really necessary? I know about the underground complex from the briefings, of course, but to just attack like this... couldn\'t we have negotiated or something? The men are asking questions, and it\'s affecting morale. Especially with all this resistance, there\'s quite a few dead civilians, and we\'re used to fighting squid---\"

Kyouko put her hand on the colonel\'s suit, causing him to stop mid‐sentence.

\"Let\'s see what\'s underground first,\" she said. \"Then we\'ll see if this was the right thing to do.\"

The words sounded unconvincing to Ryouko\'s ear, but she knew that there was little else Kyouko could say. There was also, of course, the uncomfortable irony that Ryouko\'s vision had helped cause this invasion, via Kyouko.

\"You said there were captives for us to interview?\" Kyouko asked.

Ryouko and a few of the other girls glanced over at her quizzically. They hadn\'t heard anything about any captives or interviews. The older girls didn\'t seem surprised, though.

The colonel nodded.

\"Yes, follow us.\"

He stepped to the end of the alleyway, one of the two lead sentries dashing at enhanced speed to the other side of the street, crouching behind a vehicle that had been gutted by weapons fire.

Colonel Santos disappeared around the corner, Kyouko followed immediately afterward and, taking a breath, Ryouko followed directly after.

Stepping out of the alleyway, she looked around---and stopped.

She had seen plenty of ruined buildings in the simulations, of course, and could even recall the streets of Apollo from her vision. There, though, it had always been the fault of the squid---either the squid had inflicted the damage directly, or it had been the natural result of a modern firefight, which was capable of turning an ordinary street into a ruined shell in mere minutes.

She had possessed some idea of what she was about to see, of course, from the gutted vehicle she had seen from the alleyway. The alleyway itself, though, had been seemingly intact, leading Ryouko to expect an abandoned street‐front with some incidental damage.

Instead, she faced a landscape that seemed more in place on the besieged Apollo than a colony world captured by swift invasion. Shattered storefronts spilled their wares into the street, glass melted or obliterated. Holes larger than Ryouko, lined by scorch marks, dotted most of the buildings along what had apparently been a major commercial thoroughfare. Several of the buildings had collapsed entirely, their metal and permacrete carcasses piled into the street in front of them, making it unnavigable. Squads of MPs were active around several buildings, drones spraying water in an attempt to douse several still‐smoking fires, while several larger vehicles appeared to be clearing the street, accompanied by smaller drones collecting the armored bodies that dotted the area. At a glance, most of the bodies were wearing outdated infantry armor models---but even that was far more than this colony should have had.

*The buildings were collapsed by the colonists,* Clarisse whispered in her ear. *It\'s in the battle history. They collapsed the buildings when some of their own were still inside, to try and surprise us with their fanaticism. The buildings were also rigged to collapse into the street, to impede our armor. Not that it did much.*

*Not exactly minimal civilian casualties,* Ryouko thought, a bit shakily. She was struck by Clarisse\'s blasé tone.

\"It\'s hard to keep the destruction to a minimum if they\'re going to resist the way they did,\" Nana said, appearing at Ryouko\'s side.

Nana grabbed her shoulder.

\"Come on. Let\'s not linger.\"

Ryouko continued onward, still staring, as behind her Nana waved some of the other rookies forward.

They were led to an odd circular structure set in the middle of the street. Impassive and low, perhaps only a meter tall, Ryouko would have taken it for an archaic traffic circle, were it not for the combat implants informing her the moment she saw it that it was a captured bunker with concealed weapon slits, now being used to hold civilian prisoners.

As they approached, Ryouko could see a gaping hole that had formed on one side of the structure, just large enough for one person to step through.

\"It\'s pretty small,\" Colonel Santos said as Kyouko reached the hole and peered in. \"Between the captives and the guard, there\'s only space for some of you. No more than five.\"

Ryouko relaxed slightly, not realizing until then how little she relished the prospect of confronting human prisoners. Surely, Kyouko wouldn\'t---

As if anticipating her thought, Kyouko raised an arm, making a \"come here\" gesture with her hand that was clearly intended for Ryouko.

Ryouko stepped forward as instructed, a bit apprehensive.

\"It will be you, me, Gracia, and Nana,\" Kyouko said in clear Standard. "The rest of you stand guard. You too, Elisa.\"

Elisa, Kyouko\'s designated barrier generator, looked reluctant, but didn\'t move to protest.

*Don\'t forget, I\'m supposed to be your mentor,* Kyouko thought to Ryouko. *And if the Goddess really does have plans for you, it\'s best for you to see the world as it is.*

Kyouko turned and followed Gracia and Nana into the bunker, leaving Ryouko to chew over that ominous declaration for a moment before following, jumping down the small drop.

The inside of the bunker was dimly lit by scant sunlight leaking in through the now obvious weapon slits and the blast hole. There had been light‐emitting tiles on the ceiling, but they were cracked beyond any semblance of function. In the corner lay a pile of shattered munitions and rubble.

Colonel Santos had not been kidding about the crowdedness. The four girls, the single guard, the pile of munitions, and the three captives on the floor gave Ryouko barely any room to move.

The captives themselves, three men, were unconscious, seated against the wall. One of them had medical gel covering a hole in his side. There was no sign of any armor suits they might have had.

\"We were able to knock them out with an EMP and concussion grenades,\" the guard said, faceless helmet turning towards Kyouko. \"It\'s the only way we would have gotten them alive, the way these colonists have been fighting.\"

\"The usual precautions have been taken?\" Kyouko asked, crouching down to inspect the face of one of the captives.

\"Yes, sir,\" the guard said.

Kyouko looked up, sharing a look with Nana, who nodded.

\"He means their augmentation control networks have been overridden,\" Nana said, looking at Ryouko. \"It\'s a nasty process. Involves nanite injections, all of that. It\'s the only way to make sure they can\'t commit suicide or signal anyone.\"

Ryouko gulped, nodding. Honestly, she had feared worse. The internet was rife with conspiracy theories that Governance had a backdoor into everyone\'s implant controls, even though that had been expressly forbidden by the Ethics Committee. Nanite injections and forcible takeover---well, they wouldn\'t do that if there was a backdoor, would they?

*Unless the regular army just doesn\'t know about a backdoor,* Clarisse thought. *Or the colonists managed to get rid of it. Or they only have them in military personnel.*

Is *there a backdoor?* Ryouko thought.

*Well, I don\'t know, obviously,* Clarisse thought. *They wouldn\'t tell me. I\'m just speculating.*

Kyouko stood back up and looked at Gracia.

\"What do you think?\" she asked.

\"I\'ll wake them up,\" Gracia said.

She turned to look at the guard.

\"You\'re dismissed,\" she said.

The guard glanced towards Kyouko, confusion visible even through the suit.

\"We\'ll be fine,\" Kyouko said. \"We can handle ourselves.\"

Finally, the guard nodded and left the bunker, power‐jumping up through the blast hole.

*They\'re passing information by telepathy,* Clarisse thought, making it clear by the flavor of her thought that she meant Kyouko and the other two magical girls.

*You think so?* Ryouko thought.

*They\'re controlling their expressions, but some of the facial muscles are still twitching slightly. It\'s very hard to conceal without implant assistance, and they probably haven\'t decided to go that far.*

Gracia turned back towards the prisoners on the floor, seeming simply to stare at them for a moment. Then, one of the men on the floor, the one Kyouko had been looking at, seemed to take a gasp of air, eyes snapping open. The eyes focused on the girls looking back down at him, and the man seemed to panic, eyes darting about frantically.

But he didn\'t move otherwise.

It took Ryouko a moment to realize what should have been obvious: the man was immobilized by his implants. The idea simply hadn\'t occurred to her until then, even though she knew, for instance, that civilian implants were calibrated to prevent significant violence. The utility of the immobilization was obvious, but it still bothered her, and her mind recoiled at trying to imagine what it must be like.

She swallowed surreptitiously.

\"How much time do we have?\" Gracia asked, looking at Kyouko.

Kyouko looked at the roof of the bunker, clearly examining the current battlefield situation. They all could, of course, but Kyouko had the most authority to make decisions.

\"Not enough time,\" Kyouko said. \"Are you okay with expediting this? Ordinarily, I wouldn\'t be willing to make this decision so hastily, but the information they have could greatly affect the course of the battle. Usually we rely on clairvoyants for this kind of thing, but you know...\"

\"As ready as I ever am,\" Gracia said, sighing slightly. \"Are you sure about...\"

Gracia tilted her head in Ryouko\'s direction, ever so slightly, but making it immediately clear what she meant.

\"If she\'s considering coming into this line of work, she will have to see it someday,\" Kyouko said.

\"I agree,\" Nana said, surprising Ryouko with her contribution to the conversation.

Ryouko, who had not yet figured out the point of this conversation, merely looked back at the others blankly.

Without answering her implied question, Gracia bent down towards the middle of the three prisoners, who had stopped darting his gaze around, instead choosing to fixate on Gracia.

\"It\'s painless,\" Gracia said. \"For what that\'s worth.\"

Gracia pressed her palms to the sides of the man\'s head and closed her eyes, seeming to focus. A moment later, his eyes started to glow a bright red, the details of the pupil and sclera washed out in a diffuse red glow.

Ryouko stepped back, startled.

*Is she---*

*---reading his mind against his will?* Clarisse thought. *Yeah, I think so.*

In that moment, Ryouko felt a certain visceral---well, she couldn\'t describe it, not exactly. The closest approximation might have been that she felt sick to her stomach. But it wasn\'t exactly that. It was as if she felt the strong compulsion to be anywhere but here, doing anything but watching Gracia pry the colonist\'s mind open, but instead she couldn\'t move away, couldn\'t look away. It wasn\'t moral revulsion, not exactly, though there were elements of that---she felt as if she were watching something that simply should not have been.

She felt a chill, in a way she hadn\'t when Gracia had tested her ability to defend her mind, when it had been more of a friendly game. There was no stealth here, no sneaking past the guards, no sly knocking on the door of the mind. It was simply power and will, and she recoiled at the radiant energy she felt emanating from Gracia, feeling the compulsion to flee growing ever stronger, as if her soul gem itself detested being there.

And yet she still stood there, mesmerized.

Then it was over, and she found herself blinking in confusion as the male colonist slumped down to the floor, eyes closing as he again slipped into enforced unconsciousness.

\"You okay?\" Nana asked, appearing in a flash at her elbow, and Ryouko realized that she had started to collapse towards the floor.

\"I... I think,\" Ryouko said, rubbing one hand against her forehead. She was not normally the fainting type.

\"The mind magics are closely related to the soul magics,\" Nana said into her ear. \"Every magical girl recoils instinctively at displays of soul manipulation. It takes getting used to.\"

*In her line of work, your mother has seen much more than most,* Nana thought. *There\'s a reason she didn\'t want this for you. I\'m not telling you not to be Spec Ops, but you have to know what it entails.*

Ryouko looked back at her aunt blankly, wondering the natural question:

*Why now?*

Nana looked at Kyouko, who nodded briskly, then turned towards Gracia, seemingly unaffected by what had just happened.

\"Anything valuable?\" she asked Gracia, who was recharging her soul gem into a set of grief cubes she\'d pulled out of a pouch in her costume.

\"I\'m not sure,\" Gracia said. \"I only have surface memories. To dig deeper I\'d need longer. Apparently, once the colony realized we\'d be coming, DeWitt, the cult leader, withdrew into the underground complex with all of the colony\'s children. This man hasn\'t been told what\'s down there, but DeWitt said that whatever it was would destroy us. That there was a new messiah. This particular colonist had started to doubt what DeWitt says, and viewed this battle as kind of a test of faith. Either way, they were supposed to buy as much time as possible.\"

Kyouko grunted, curling her lip into a bit of a snarl.

\"Religious lunatics. No wonder we haven\'t found any children on this colony. That\'s not very informative, though. You sure you don\'t have any more information?\"

\"One of the tenets of their cult was that only a few would know the details of what\'s going on. That way, if anyone were to capture one of them and interrogate them, there wouldn\'t be much to find. I have to say, if they stuck to that, it was pretty clever.\"

Gracia glanced down, shaking her head.

\"I can dig deeper into this one,\" she said, gesturing at the soldier she had just finished \"interrogating\", \"but I think it\'d be more useful for me to check the others. I\'d guess they don\'t know any more than this guy, though. I\'d need someone high‐ranking, somehow.\"

Kyouko threw her head up and laughed, sharp and shrill, startling Ryouko into jumping slightly.

\"Clever in more than one way, I\'d wager,\" Kyouko said. \"Given what is supposedly waiting for us underground, I\'d say we\'re on the clock. Who knows what\'s going on down there? With all those kids... this is now a humanitarian thing. Do we call his bluff?\"

The way Kyouko said \"humanitarian\", casually, carelessly, felt oddly off‐putting to Ryouko.

\"Keep at it,\" Kyouko ordered, pointing Gracia at the soldiers. \"It looks like old General Albescu wants to have a powwow with Governance, now that we have the results of your interrogation and Rhamnusia is almost at the entrance to the underground complex.\"

Kyouko stalked up to the blast hole, then stopped, turning towards Ryouko.

\"Come on,\" she said. \"There\'s no reason for you to be here.\"

Ryouko gulped, then hastened to follow Kyouko out, leaving Nana behind with Gracia.

She didn\'t want to see that bunker again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Are we absolutely sure there\'s no antimatter squirreled down there? No nuclear devices?\" Colonial Affairs asked, sharp feminine voice rising over the virtual conference table.

At the other end of the conference table, the assembled senior officers of the invasion force, headlined by Lieutenant General Sakura Kyouko and General Pavel Albescu, grimaced nearly in unison. While retaining their individual personalities far more than an equivalent set of fleet commanders, army commanders in a combat zone were still connected together on a level deeper than thought and sometimes, it showed.

The only part of the military delegation who didn\'t grimace was Mami, who was seated next to Kyouko, looking regal in her full dress uniform, an affectation she had only taken on after ascending to the Chair of the General Staff.

\"The scanners have come up negative on all counts,\" General Albescu said. \"And now that we are on the ground, they should be considerably more accurate. If we\'ve missed anything nuclear, then at least the antinuclear defenses will hopefully counter a detonation. We can\'t do much about antimatter, but that\'s also much easier to detect.\"

\"Antinuclear defenses\" was the unimaginative term for the set of automatic defense systems designed to detect the opening stages of a fissile chain reaction and immediately irradiate the area with a burst of exotic particles designed to force the reaction to fizzle and explode without releasing most of its energy. First developed in the cauldron of the Unification Wars as a counter to hand‐delivered tactical nuclear weapons, it was these kinds of devices on both sides, along with the comparative cost of producing and transporting antimatter, that prevented the war with the aliens from being a frenzy of nuclear weapon detonations.

But they were not perfect, as Kyouko expected to be brought up immediately as an objection.

\"Those defenses are hardly foolproof, General,\" Science and Technology said, shaking his head lightly. \"Nor are the scanners. The Cephalopods have certainly demonstrated this a number of times. Even with clairvoyant support, it\'s an iffy business at best.\"

\"If we assault the underground structure as planned, and they *do detonate even a small nuclear device, the casualties will be tremendous,\" Mami said, glancing over at the other military officers. "And it will be difficult to conceal what happened here.\"

\"These are not the Cephalopods,\" General Albescu said. \"Despite whatever unusual abilities the colonists have demonstrated so far, they are not nearly as technically competent, or we would not already be in control of the surface.\"

\"With all due respect,\" Kyouko said. \"What would you have us do? We have a possibly insane cult leader deep underground with a colony\'s worth of children and teenagers, along with Goddess knows what. If this were purely a military matter, or if we had any idea what was down there, we could afford to take our time and do this carefully. But right now we have the equivalent of a hostage situation!\"

A collective intake of breath all around the table, including from the Governance Representatives. It was not a pleasant situation, no matter how you sliced it.

\"It is true: we don\'t have terribly many options,\" Military Affairs said, baritone voice rising over the table. \"With the clairvoyants out, we\'re now running blind. Have there been any attempts at contact or negotiation?\"

General Albescu shook his head.

\"Not yet. I felt that was a decision for this council to make.\"

\"Is there any other way to get information about the interior of this underground complex?\" Mami asked, looking over at her subordinates. \"A MagOps insertion, perhaps?\"

Kyouko cleared her throat, getting the attention of the table. Her thoughts had already progressed along this line; she had merely been waiting for the proper opening to give her pitch.

\"In truth, I have already considered the possibility,\" Kyouko said. "We already have enough personnel and experience to make the attempt, and our clairvoyants can still see *part* of the facility, which makes teleportation feasible. Enough teleporters, an earth manipulator, numerous Black Ops personnel, and, in fact, a significant proportion of the team that destroyed the alien wormhole. I could assemble the team in twenty minutes, real‐time, and make the insertion. A kind of stealth reconnaissance, with force if necessary. We can relay what we find out by telepathy, and then we can decide what to do. There won\'t be time to train specifically for this scenario, but hopefully there will be enough veteran experience for it not to matter.\"

\"The way you talk, it sounds like you intend to go yourself,\" Yuma said, peering directly at Kyouko, eyes seeming to bore into her. Even as old as she was, Kyouko did not like being under that look.

\"I do,\" Kyouko said, as levelly as she could.

She heard Mami let out a breath, using one hand to knead the bridge of her nose.

\"That is hardly wise, general,\" Military Affairs said, voice rumbling. "You don\'t need me to tell you that. Not to put too fine a point on it, but someone of your importance should not be risking your life on a mission with this level of danger.\"

Importance. Kyouko knew why she was important to Governance. She was important because her followers believed her to be important, because her Church\'s activities were important to the health of the magical girl population, and because without her leadership the Church might splinter and fall to ashes like so many before it. Governance didn\'t care about her or her Church per se, only the ends they achieved. Other than that, she knew Governance considered her Church a bit of an abomination, fundamentally not that different from the cult on X‐25.

\"I am also the most experienced girl on this mission by far,\" she said. \"No one else of my age group is anywhere near X‐25, and I am one of only a few girls on the planet with any experience fighting other magical girls. This is a situation where I feel I\'d be more useful in the field than in command. We certainly have no shortage of commanders.\"

The Governance Representatives shared a look.

Finally, Yuma sighed.

\"I don\'t mean to be indelicate, *Onee‐chan,* but are you sure you aren\'t allowing your personal history to interfere with your decision‐making?\"

Kyouko let out a breath. She supposed it was too much for her to hope that Governance---and Mami---would allow such an obvious point to pass by. The downside of being famous was that everyone knew your life story, even if the relevant events were centuries ago.

\"I would say I\'m using my personal history to *inform* my decision‐making,\" she said. \"I am painfully aware of what can result from religious fanaticism, and I feel it is only natural that I would exert myself to prevent it. I feel that, as a religious leader myself, I may also be uniquely positioned to negotiate, should such a situation arise.\"

She met the gazes of the Directorate Subcommittee, and of Mami, and tried not to think of how much the street‐rat Kyouko would have laughed, long ago, at what she had just said.

Yuma tilted her head at the other Governance Representatives, the AI‐human collective clearly performing some sort of off‐record consultation.

\"I feel obliged to point out that, as of yet, we haven\'t actually discussed whether sending in a penetration team is really the best option,\" Mami said, looking at Kyouko and General Albescu. \"Granted, I\'m not sure I see any better options, but I feel it\'s at least worth discussing.\"

\"Well, there aren\'t any better options,\" General Albescu said, \"Not that I can see, or else I would dissuade General Sakura here from this foolhardy mission.\"

\"Indeed,\" Yuma said. \"It really is the most promising solution. The only real question is whether it is really wise for General Sakura here to personally go. We have decided to respect her argument regarding her experience, in light of her great age. Please do not disappoint us. If it is necessary, we will meet again, once more information is obtained.\"

Yuma winked out of the simulation like a soap bubble, simultaneously with the rest of Governance.

Just like that, the meeting was over. Governance was never big on farewells.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The invasion force was well‐stocked with qualified magical girls, but as she had mentioned to Governance, few of those had the desired Spec Ops experience. Of those who did, many were already with her: Azrael, Marianne, Gracia and Nana fell easily into this category. Azrael wasn\'t logical to bring, sadly, despite her experience, simply because bringing a flier into an underground facility was far from optimal.

She wanted to bring Ryouko, of course, because it was clearly intended by the Goddess, and the girl had shown an ability to perform in the wormhole mission. Earth mages were rare, so Meiqing, who she had summoned to this operation deliberately, was a natural inclusion despite her lack of experience. The other rookies were out of the question, except...

Well, Nakihara Asami. Whatever the girl\'s situation with Ryouko---and there definitely *was* one, as Kyouko well knew from perusing Ryouko\'s personnel file---it wasn\'t sufficient justification to bring her on the mission. However, the two girls had shown signs of power synergy while stationed with the lab on Eurydome. It wasn\'t really a great reason, but Kyouko had a hunch.

So, she had assigned Asami as well, much to the girl\'s obvious delight.

It was a short ride from where they had landed to the rally point for the newly assembled MagOps team, just in front of what appeared to be the main entrance to the underground complex. They could have hoofed it---it was generally safer for magical girls to stay active and mobile---but the city was secure enough that they could ride IFVs, so they did. Kyouko had learned long ago that magical girls were not any less lazy than the average human, and riding in relative comfort improved morale.

The other option was to teleport there, but it was taking time anyway to extricate the remaining members of the newly‐formed team---those not assigned to Kyouko originally---out of their respective combat situations, so there was no reason to rush it too much.

Normally, Kyouko would have chatted with the other girls on the way, but at the moment, she simply wasn\'t in the mood, preferring to sit quietly, eyes closed in thought.

*Why did you show that to me?* Ryouko thought. *Why now?*

She opened her eyes, looking at the girl next to her. Ryouko\'s eyes looked bothered and disturbed, in a way she hadn\'t shown in the bunker itself.

Then she closed her eyes again, returning to her previous posture.

*You\'ve had time to think about it, then? It disturbs you.*

There was a pause before the girl answered.

*Yes. It does. It makes sense why you did it, but it still seems wrong.*

Kyouko let out a breath.

*There\'s a thing the Incubators always prattle on about. You probably haven\'t heard about it at all, since they talk to new girls so infrequently now, but they used to always tell us that the universe has to stay in balance, that the amount of good is always balanced by the amount of bad.*

*I\'ve heard of that. It\'s a very Buddhist idea. I\'ve read about it on the internet, but the question always is: Where is the bad for our wishes? According to the Incubators, human progress is based entirely on wishes, but with the MSY, where is the bad?*

*It doesn\'t really make much sense, does it? But there is a kernel of truth to it. When you see good being done on a wide scale, the world being made better, it very rarely comes without a cost. This was true for Governance and it was true for the MSY.*

Kyouko waited a moment, until she was sure the other girl had understood.

*Do you know the meaning of the name Black Heart? It means that at the core of the MSY there is a kernel of darkness, that nourishes the whole body and can never be removed. At the core of the soul gem is a speck of black despair.*

Kyouko paused, letting out a breath.

*Do you know the story of my life? What happened to my family when I was a child?*

It was a long while before Ryouko responded, but Kyouko was content to wait.

*Yes. I know the story.*

*What do you think it does to a girl, to see something like that, at an age like that? After that I spent a full year running from the truth, thinking that I could ignore the world and hunt my food.*

She opened her eyes again, and found Ryouko watching her now, eyes wide.

*To be Spec Ops, and more than that, Black Ops, is to see the darkness, know the darkness and sometimes, be the darkness. That last part is the Black Heart\'s motto, and you\'ll hear about it if they ever formally induct you. It\'s not just about raiding alien bases. That\'s why I\'m bringing you down into the tunnels with me. We have no choice but to face whatever is down there.*

Kyouko smiled, feeling the vehicle slow to a halt. She had timed this perfectly.

She stood up, stretching luxuriously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operational magical girl teams rarely consisted of more than fourteen members, simply for reasons of power coordination and leadership. If it were felt that an operation needed more manpower, it was generally the case that two teams of eight or higher would be assigned instead. At the same time, having less than eight members on a team was considered risky, leaving the team lacking in critical specializations.

This mission was primarily intended as reconnaissance, so only one team was necessary. Besides the girls Kyouko already had with her---a teleporter, a telepath‐clairvoyant, a clairvoyant who could also hack in the field, two girls who were effectively telekinetics, and a melee illusionist---she had also summoned Mina Guyure to serve as a second teleporter, two additional barrier generators, and no fewer than three stealth generators, to suit the nature of the mission. Nearly all were well suited to combat in confined space, and the group of girls had diverse secondary specialties and hobbies, ranging from xenobiology to physics. You never knew what came in handy.

The remaining girls were already assembled at the rally point, a newly fortified building just outside an ostentatious cathedral‐like structure in the center of the settlement which contained the entrance to the underground complex.

Kyouko looked over the motley group of girls, seated on various boxes and pieces of still‐intact furniture inside the depressing, gray room.

\"Well, you\'ve already got the mission details so I won\'t repeat them to you,\" she said. \"I wish there were more time to prepare, but this must be done ASAP. We will be relying on your experience with teamwork to carry this off successfully. Look around, have your TacComps imprint your team members and their combat roles into your memory. It\'s just a little reconnaissance, so I won\'t tolerate any casualties on my watch. If there\'s any talking to be done, let me do it.\"

She paused for a long moment, allowing the team to look each other over. She saw several look over the \"Hero of Orpheus\" carefully, as well as the other girls of the wormhole mission team.

Then she rubbed her hands together.

\"Alright ladies,\" she said. \"Let\'s get this show on the road.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A short while later, Ryouko found herself in what looked like an unremarkable office, with a chair, small desk, and... not much else. It was one of the few locations in the facility their team clairvoyants could see the surroundings of clearly, and was therefore probably safe to arrive in.

That didn\'t mean it *was* safe, of course; they spent a few tense moments nervously scanning the area with scanners, magic, and basic human senses.

*Stealth field is up,* Agnes Griffin, one of their stealth generators, thought, replicating the message that had already passed through machine channels.

*Backup stealth field is up,* Xochi Espina, another stealth generator, echoed. The third would stay on standby until needed.

*Can either of you get a better view now that we\'re here?* Kyouko thought at Marianne and Gracia.

*I can see a bit farther outward,* Marianne thought. *But not anywhere as far as usual. Someone is definitely jamming us. Not only is that a very rare magical power, but whoever it is they\'re doing so quite skillfully.*

*That is my situation as well,* Gracia thought.

*What\'s around us?* Kyouko thought.

*Mainly more offices,* Gracia thought. *It seems to be structured like a lab, but the equipment has been removed.*

*A lab,* Marianne echoed. *You\'d think if there was a lab down here, someone aboveground would know what was going on, but none of the prisoners interrogated so far seem to have a clear idea.*

*That\'s easy,* their backup barrier generator, Tammy Shepard, thought. Whoever is down here stayed down here. I reckon they\'ll be here soon enough.*

From the corner of her eye, Ryouko saw Meiqing swallow nervously.

*We\'ll see soon enough,* Kyouko thought. *Marianne, you think you can safely check if there\'s any lab data remaining locally? Could be useful.*

Marianne shrugged.

*It\'s not like I actually hack anything. It\'s magic. They won\'t pick me up unless they have another magical girl watching the systems.*

*They could,* Nana pointed out.

*We didn\'t come here not to gather data,* Kyouko thought. *The risk is small. Try it.*

Marianne nodded, then pointed towards one of the near walls, next to the desk.

*It will be safe for me to touch the wall?* she thought, looking at Agnes.

*It should be.*

A series of bright white strings flew from Marianne\'s hands, sticking to the wall on contact. She stood there for a moment, eyes closed, seeming to be listening to something.

*No, the data has been completely wiped,* she thought.

*I shouldn\'t be surprised,* Kyouko thought. *Alright, let\'s move out. Barrier generators and Gracia first, stealth generators and teleporters in the middle, Marianne last. Marianne, can you get the door open? Don\'t forget to close it behind us.*

The door slid open immediately, and the group of girls headed out into the hallway in roughly the order prescribed. Ryouko doubted a team leader would have ordinarily been as explicit with her instructions as Kyouko had been, but there had been no time to prepare or train---better to be wordy than sorry.

Ryouko took a moment to look at their team map of the area. It was pitifully incomplete, with only the area immediately around them revealed and the rest of it essentially a giant question mark.

*Er, I think I can get a better idea of the rooms,* Meiqing thought. *I have some idea of how the earth in our vicinity is arranged, and I\'m not being jammed. I can\'t warn you of any enemies, though.*

She updated the map of the area, which expanded to nearly double the previous size, though the outer ring was considered not necessarily safe.

*Good thinking,* Kyouko thought. *Let\'s go. It looks like there might be a main hallway coming up.*

They moved forward cautiously, but briskly. A stealth field of this magnitude was expensive to maintain, and they had been instructed not to linger unless necessary.

As they walked, Ryouko peered around at the walls and ceiling, trying to find anything unusual about the office complex that would justify the situation they were in. The facilities looked completely standard, though, if a little utilitarian---the walls were a uniform flat gray, whereas the lab on Eurydome had had elaborate decorative stone slabs, and most buildings on Earth would have had display walls.

The hallways were lined with impassive sealed doors, and though Marianne opened a few, there was nothing to see. Completely denuded lab facilities, with not a single piece of equipment left behind.

Kavitha Srinivas, one of the barrier generators, called the group to a halt.

*Sorry,* she thought. *But I did an apprenticeship in a nanotechnology lab, and I think I recognize some of this. The equipment may be gone, but they can\'t have torn out all the water and resource feeds. Can we go into this one? I want to take a look; I know we have to be quick.*

Kyouko nodded her assent, issuing into their mental interfaces the relevant specific commands. They filed into the room, again in the previously‐determined order---while under stealth field, the group could not be broken up.

Kavitha stood in the middle of the room, between two semi‐circular workbenches, looking around.

*This was a nanotech lab. It has to be. This is where you\'d adjust the programming. Over there---*

She pointed at the corner of the room.

*You can see the holes where the nanofabricator draws resources.*

*Can you see anything else?* Kyouko thought.

*Not from here,* the barrier generator thought. *This is fairly generic. The other rooms looked fairly similar, but to be really sure we\'d have to go through each one.*

Kyouko shook her head.

*We don\'t have time. It\'s more important to look through the rest of the facility. The exact type of nanotech going here isn\'t as important.*

They shuffled back out of the empty lab.

*This is creepy,* Asami thought to Ryouko, turning into words what they were all thinking. *All these empty rooms... it feels like a graveyard. It feels like a ghost could attack at any moment. I don\'t like it.*

Ryouko reached out and squeezed Asami\'s hand, earning a surprised look back in response. Ryouko didn\'t meet it, though, preferring to continue scanning the corners of the room.

The group froze, simultaneously spotting on their monitors what Marianne had detected: a pair of armored guards around the corner, guarding a door at the end of the corridor.

*We could avoid them easily just by turning left here instead,* Agnes thought, *They won\'t see us passing by through my stealth.*

*We came here for reconnaissance,* Kyouko thought. *So we\'re going to do reconnaissance. If there\'s guards at a door, that means the important things are behind the door. The stealth should be able to hide us, as long as no one does anything stupid like walk into one of the guards. Eyes open; we\'re going right.*

*Remember the plan,* Kyouko thought, as they walked forward. *We explore until we find where the children are or we have to leave. If we can, we take some prisoners on the way out.*

The end of the corridor was a T‐intersection with a large, sealed double door, with the two guards stationed at both sides. According to their clairvoyance, the other end of the double door was cavernous, a giant room larger than any of the others they had passed---the closer they got to the door, the farther in Marianne and Gracia could see, but neither of them had yet labeled the far wall of the room, nor had they yet labeled anything they might have seen inside the room.

Then, having just reached the guards, Marianne and Gracia simultaneously froze midstep.

*What is it?* Kyouko asked, standing only a few feet away from one of the oblivious guards.

*We have to go in,* Marianne thought.

*What do you see?* Kyouko pressed. *Is it the children?*

*Incubation equipment,* Gracia thought. *Empty, as far as I can tell, but I can\'t see all of it. I\'m no expert, but based on the size, I think it\'s the kind intended for humans. I just can\'t see it clearly yet---not with this jamming.*

She forwarded a picture to the group, reconstructed from her brain activity. It looked like the same kind of incubators Ryouko had once seen in Mitakihara, but seen from a substantial distance. Ryouko could see why the clairvoyants were having trouble making a clear assessment.

The members of the team glanced at each other nervously.

*I think she\'s right,* Nana thought. *And I* am *an expert. I can\'t be sure unless we get closer though.*

Kyouko grimaced.

*I was afraid of this kind of thing. Alright, Ryouko, teleport us in---follow Marianne\'s clairvoyance. The rest of you: be ready for a trap. Especially the barrier generators.*

*A trap?*

*Blatant guards, sealed door?* Kyouko thought. *It\'s what I would use as bait. Hopefully they just can\'t see us, though.*

Ryouko let out a breath.

*Alright, gather around me,* she thought. *Same as before.*

As the others gathered around, she spared a glance down at her soul gem. It was still clear and bright, and a single short‐range teleport was unlikely to strain it.

Ryouko closed her eyes, letting herself enter Marianne\'s mindscape. She didn\'t really need it for such an easy teleport, but it made things easier.

She reached inward, stretching the fabric of space‐time just *so*---

And then they were there, and could see it with their own eyes, through the pale blue glow of Kavitha\'s barrier around then.

They stood in shock for a moment, stunned by the sheer magnitude of what they were seeing.

The warehouse‐sized room stretched forward almost as far as the eye could see, the far wall only barely visible behind rows and rows of human‐sized incubation vats, about twice as tall as Ryouko. Unlike the ones she had seen at Prometheus, these did not have transparent sides, impassively gray and metallic from top to bottom. There was, however, little doubt as to what they were; centuries of movies about the Freedom Alliance had given the general public a good sense of what modern incubation vats looked like, in all their variations.

Several members of the team, even some of the veterans, were visibly fazed. Asami grabbed Ryouko\'s shoulder, and Meiqing appeared to shudder.

*Let\'s not overreact yet,* Nana thought. *I know what it looks like, but it could be something else. Marianne or Gracia, can you check, uh, what\'s in the tanks?*

*I haven\'t seen anything yet,* Gracia thought. *Just empty fluid and tubing. I\'m checking the tanks one by one.*

*Keep trying,* Nana thought. *Marianne, do you think you can check the computer systems for information?*

Marianne looked at Kyouko, who nodded.

*Maybe,* Marianne thought. *It depends on exactly how these tanks are connected to the main system. There isn\'t a canonical connectivity like there is for in‐wall systems, and I have to find the relevant wiring.*

Marianne extended her threads to the nearest tank, her strings detaching and reattaching several times before she shook her head and thought:

*No, as far as these tanks are concerned, they\'re just individual incubation tanks connected to a remote monitoring and control system. There\'s no direct connection to any databases that would tell us what the overall purpose is.*

She paused for a moment.

*They\'re definitely configured for human incubation, though. But this one is on empty standby.*

*For ectogenesis, embryos and fetuses are typically grown separately in smaller chambers before being transferred to a large tank like this one,* Nana thought. *This one could just be on standby. If we go somewhere else, we might find some active ones.*

*Still no personnel,* Xochi thought. *I don\'t like it. Something\'s up.*

*It\'s obvious* something *is up,* Agnes thought. *It would help to know what.*

*Let\'s head down this row,* Nana thought. *Tank arrays like this are typically sorted by age, for convenience. If these are empty then the active ones are probably farther down the row.*

*Is that really a good idea, though?* Marianne thought. *Even if we find whatever---whoever---they\'re growing down here, will it really help us know what they\'re doing? I\'d much rather find an administrative terminal or something.*

*Or a technician we could interrogate,* Gracia grumbled.

*We have to save prisoners for last,* Kyouko reminded. *And right now these tanks are right in front of us. It\'d be crazy not to look through them before we start looking for terminals or something. Let\'s move forward.*

Headed by Gracia, they moved forward briskly, but deathly silent. Some measure of silence was considered good mission protocol, even under a stealth field---but not this much silence.

*Do you have any guesses about what\'s going on here?* Ryouko thought finally, addressing Kyouko.

*My guess is that the cult leader is trying to clone magical girls, Kyouko thought, responding surprisingly quickly. *Not just the body, but the mind and personality, to try and duplicate wishes. It\'s what makes sense given the cult\'s history, and it\'s also the first thing anyone thinks of when they start thinking about this kind of thing.*

Ryouko waited for Kyouko to continue, but she didn\'t, and finally Ryouko asked:

*Would that work, though?*

*It\'s complicated. The short answer is that you wouldn\'t get the same girls making the same wishes over and over. Potential just doesn\'t work that way; you can ask any Incubator. The long answer is that since these girls will have favorable genetics and you can manufacture a stressful life situation, they really will be more likely to contract. It\'s really not worth the investment though, unless you do this kind of thing on a massive scale. Like, interstellar‐massive. Not like this.*

The group fell back into silence. To Ryouko, the way Kyouko talked made it sound like she had seen the problem studied before---but even she knew better than to say that out loud.

About halfway down the aisle, Gracia held up her hand to stop the group from advancing further.

*The ones in front of us are occupied. Human girls... I can sense their minds dreaming. These aren\'t empty clones. Other than that, I can\'t tell if there\'s anything unusual about them.*

Without waiting for any prompting, Marianne shot out an arm, strings radiating from her in all directions to contact all the tanks in the area in front of them.

*As far as these tanks are concerned, the inhabitants are standard human, and they are performing maintenance as such. I can\'t rule out the possibility that the configuration settings have been changed, though. But they\'re all girls.*

*Empty clones?* Meiqing asked, the tenor of the thought quizzical in the air.

*It\'s not important right now,* Kyouko thought, brushing the question aside. *Gracia, you\'re the telepath: Can you pick up anything?*

*It\'s hard to explain, but not really. Kind of a static. No images. I\'m pretty sure these girls have never been outside these tanks.*

*It goes without saying there\'s not going to be any boys in this set, Kyouko thought angrily. *I wonder what they\'re doing to them? False memories? Mind‐control implants? Do they kill them if they don\'t contract? What are the Incubators thinking not telling us about this place?*

As Kyouko continued, she seemed to get progressively more furious, spear starting to shake where she had planted the handle into the ground, until Ryouko began to fear Kyouko would smash something in rage.

But in the end, Kyouko seemed to calm down, then turned to face the rest of the group.

*Well, for the newer girls, you should know that before the MSY, we faced this kind of stuff all the time, just not with as much tech. Anyway, Gracia, I think it\'s time we sent an update to the surface. Then we can move on.*

Gracia nodded, then closed her eyes. As the group\'s primary telepath, she had longer telepathy range than any of the others, extending well beyond the hundred meters normally imposed by the direct soul gem connection.

They waited expectantly.

Finally, Gracia opened her eyes again.

\"Oh,\" she said aloud, startling all of them.

*We didn\'t think of this,* she thought, a moment later. *My telepathy is blocked, too. More than that, trying to do that... I\'ve been detected. They know we\'re here. Right here, exactly.*

\"Fuck,\" one of the girls said, elegantly succinct.

*Get us out of here!* Marianne thought, looking at Ryouko.

\"No,\" Kyouko countermanded, voice hard.

She picked up her spear, pointing it forward, leaning into a combat stance.

\"If we\'ve been detected, we\'ve already shit the bed. If the children are being taken as hostages, then backing out is only going to let them do what they\'re going to do. We\'ve got to try to find them *now.*\"

Kyouko\'s voice turned into a growl, harsh enough that Ryouko felt herself quail, wanting to---

*I think I know where she is,* Gracia announced.

They turned to look at the telepath, as a single bright blip appeared on their internal navigation maps.

*The girl who\'s blocking me, I mean,* Gracia thought. *She blocked me, but I was also able to sense where she blocked me from.*

*Then that\'s where we\'re going,* Kyouko announced, sweeping her spear grandiosely in the direction of the blip. *This ain\'t a stealth mission anymore, ladies! Let\'s bring it hard and fast! Ryouko!*

Ryouko nodded, swallowing, then closed her eyes, as the others gathered around her.

She took a breath.

This... was a new feeling. She couldn\'t understand. It wasn\'t that she couldn\'t do it. It just felt... unsafe. She didn\'t feel the certainty that---

She opened her eyes, shaking her head decisively.

\"I can\'t,\" she said, trying to keep her voice as level as possible in the face of disappointment. \"Whatever is blocking the clairvoyance---it\'s also blocking my ability to know where I\'m teleporting. I\'m going to teleport into a wall or something. It wouldn\'t be safe. I can do a short‐range teleport over and over, but---\"

Kyouko let out a growl of inchoate anger.

*Save your energy,* she thought. *This will be faster anyway.*

Kyouko dashed forward, the rest of the team following a few milliseconds later, responding with combat reflexes.

Elisa sharpened her barrier to a point, barreling the group *through* a wall into the next room over, which they could see was clear through clairvoyance.

Ryouko followed, letting the doubts in her heart be quelled by the moment.

But as she watched Kyouko\'s back, she couldn\'t help but remember that, just for a moment, she had doubted Kyouko\'s judgment. That, before Gracia had announced she knew where the interdicting magical girl was, Ryouko had seen the group doubt Kyouko\'s judgment, even in the face of her command authority.

*If the children are being taken as hostages, then backing out is only going to let them do what they\'re going to do. We\'ve got to try to find them* now.

It was compelling logic, but it wasn\'t the only possible logic.

*Where was Kyouko taking them?*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Traversing the interior of a structure *through* the walls, rather than through the usual corridors, was an audacious maneuver, and rarely practiced. While its value in shock and speed was clear, it generally required a powerful barrier generator capable of efficiently breaking through the wall and a clairvoyant capable of mapping an advance route and accurately predicting whether the wall that was about to be broken was important to the structural integrity of the building. Few situations really required *that* much speed, and most such situations could be handled much more efficiently by a teleporter. Only the Black Heart or Soul Guard ever practiced \"bulldozing\", for those circumstances when a team lost its teleporters.

Such was the logic that Clarisse piped through Ryouko\'s mind as she found herself dashing into the next room under a shower of steel and concrete debris, deflected by the golden barrier that surrounded her.

There was no time to reflect, however, or to inspect the mysterious bulbous equipment that filled the new room---with a palpable thud, Elisa was already breaking through the next wall, holding up with one arm the shield that she used to project her barrier. Chunks of material flew away from the edges of the impact area, and Elisa\'s yellow hair twisted with magical energy.

Then they were in the next room, a large storage area stacked with boxes.

So it went, through another corridor and several lab areas, before Gracia thought:

*The next room is a hallway, with guards moving in. It looks like they\'ve responded to what we\'re doing and are trying to intercept us. We should be ready.*

*The hallways have automated defenses,* Meiqing thought.

It was a repeat of facts that had already appeared on their internal maps, but everyone appreciated the explicit reminder. The downside of breaking down walls to travel was that your opponents could easily track your movements even when stealthed, due to the clear trail of broken walls behind you. The stealth was still useful, though, by making it impossible to monitor you in real‐time.

A series of blips rang out over the group telepathic network, coordinating upcoming combat actions. The telepathic messages were unspoken, tiny snippets of intention, just enough to relay meaning. It was a fast, impersonal method of communication that reminded most people of machines, and was consequently only really used in combat.

Then they burst through the wall, Elisa\'s barrier shearing directly through a guard unfortunate enough to be caught on the side, causing blood and viscera to fly up sickeningly, thankfully caught by the barrier itself. A sharp, continuous buzzing noise sounded as weapons fire impacted the barrier from all sides, from automated defense systems installed in the ceiling, combat drones, and guards hurriedly backing towards covered positions along the corridor.

That was a mistake on the parts of the guards, of course.

A moment later, Ryouko teleported herself to behind the group of guards on the left, carrying half the group with her, while Mina took the other half of the group to the other end of the corridor, essentially trapping their welcoming committee between two pincers.

She immediately released a fusillade of arrows, strafing the area in front of her indiscriminately, bright green bolts shimmering as they found and penetrated their targets. Asami tore a set of automated defenses out of the ceiling with her gravity, three copies of Kyouko impaled whoever was closest, and Meiqing stood ready to bring the entire ceiling down with the weight of the earth above, if necessary.

Seeing movement out of the corner of her eye, Ryouko blinked again, finding herself looking at the dull black plating of an armored suit. She instinctively summoned an arrow into her arbalest, punching it forward with her arm instead of firing.

She saw blood and hydraulic fluid gush out, just a little, then pulled the arrow downward, searing a bright green gash into the armor of the guard in front of her.

She heard herself suck in a breath, and then the guard collapsed, and she found herself looking down the corridor.

Meiqing hadn\'t needed to use her specialty---their initial attack had completely cleared the corridor, leaving only twitching armored corpses, as well as a few living guards at the other end of the corridor that appeared to have been disabled by Nana, and one that was attached to Marianne\'s hands with a set of strings.

Ryouko saw with a not‐insignificant sense of satisfaction that many of the twenty‐odd group of soldiers appeared to have been disabled by her arrows, still active and glowing where they had landed.

She remembered, then, what Kyouko had said once about her bloodlust, and dismissed the arrows. She felt a little sickened, realizing she had left the arrows active just so she could count her \"kills\", so to speak.

She wished she knew just what it was that came over her in the midst of combat.

*Alright, we have to keep moving,* Kyouko thought. *Marianne, Nana, finish those guards and let\'s go.*

Marianne transmitted a sense of refusal, then shook her head.

*Something is wrong,* she thought. *The implant structure of these guards is... is---*

*These guards aren\'t adults,* Gracia thought, eyes widened, looking between the armored figures that Nana had disabled. *Reading their minds---these are teenagers.*

The other members of the group looked at each other, and then Marianne gestured at the armored figure she held in her control.

A moment later, the seals popped off the neck area of the suit, the guard reaching up ponderously to her helmet and pulling it off slowly.

It was as Gracia had said---the face that stared emptily back at them was a teenage girl, a few years older than Ryouko, blonde hair tied back in a small ponytail.

Without realizing what she was doing, Ryouko looked down at her hand, and at the blood that stained her hand and sleeve.

For a moment she saw the dream again, saw her hands coated in blood after a battle---

But that had been squid ichor, not red human blood, and---

*Emotional suppression activated,* Clarisse thought, and Ryouko felt the sense of numbness she hadn\'t realized was washing over her fade away, replaced by a sense of cold calm.

Ryouko looked over at Asami and saw in her face that they were both suppressed.

She felt someone touch her hand and looked down in surprise, finding that the blood on her hand was gone.

*Don\'t leave something like that there,* Elisa thought. *Bad for the health.*

*What\'s going on here?* Kyouko demanded, voice carrying a note of pain. Are these the children we\'re looking for? Gracia, read their minds!*

*From what I can tell, this guard is far more heavily implanted than any civilian would warrant,* Marianne thought. *And more heavily implanted than any of the of the civilians aboveground were. It should not be this easy for me to control a civilian with an implant hack. Either these colonists were heavily modifying their children, or...*

Her voice trailed off for a moment, before she forced herself to finish:

*...or we\'re looking at whoever was growing in those tanks we just saw.*

With visible reluctance, Gracia gestured at one of her mind‐controlled guards to approach her.

*I\'m going to need most of my focus to read deep memories; Nana, can you disable the rest of them?*

Nana nodded, raising her right hand. With a flash of violet light, the other guards under Gracia\'s mind‐control collapsed to the floor, unable to move without functioning suit servomotors.

*It\'s done,* she thought. *Be fast, keeping all this technology disabled will tax my strength.*

Gracia nodded, as the helmet of the guard in front of her disengaged.

She placed her hands at the side of the head of the girl, who had black hair and Asian features, in contrast to the guard under Marianne\'s control.

The group stood there for a long moment, holding their breaths, until Gracia opened her eyes again, keeping her hands on the other girl\'s head. Her face looked like she had chewed on something particularly unpleasant.

*She was definitely vat‐grown,* she thought. *She has a whole lifetime of memories, but it\'s obvious they were artificially introduced, because they haven\'t made any impression on her soul. None of the memories before she was about twelve are real.*

Gracia let out a breath.

*It looks like Kyouko was right; they were constantly urged to make contracts. Apparently, they lived down here, and they were told it was their destiny to contract.*

*Did any of them actually contract?* Kyouko asked.

*Not that this girl has ever seen,* Gracia thought. *Apparently, after about three years with no contract, her mind started rejecting the false memories, so they...*

Gracia paused for a long moment, closing her eyes for a moment.

*Well, she doesn\'t actually have any significant memories after that, not that I can find,* Gracia said. *There\'s clearly been a lot deleted. The thing to know, though, is that it\'s hard to keep memories suppressed or maintain fake ones with technology. Even the best telepaths can\'t do it perfectly. The soul always remembers. This was done pretty poorly; if you give me another five minutes or so, I can extract what\'s missing.*

*We don\'t* have *five minutes,* Kyouko thought.

*Wait, there are telepaths that can make fake memories?* Meiqing thought.

*Why did you bring rookies anyway?* Elisa asked, sounding annoyed. *This really isn\'t the mission for them.*

*I know we don\'t have time,* Nana thought. *But we\'re already here. We* need *information. We can\'t just keep on going with nothing to go on.*

*We\'ve also got girls under emotional suppression,* Marianne said, gesturing at Ryouko and her two friends. *They won\'t be combat‐effective enough unless we can bring them out of it. We can take some time to try.*

Kyouko gritted her teeth, before tearing her gaze away from the girls prostrate on the ground in armor suits.

*Alright, fine, we\'ll take five minutes,* she said. *But we can\'t keep standing here like sitting ducks. First let\'s move everyone with a few short‐range teleports. Then, we can hide under the stealth. Ryouko, Mina, each of you take half the group. We\'ll make four jumps. Leave the extra prisoners.*

*I think I can take you off of suppression,* Clarisse thought.

*Are you sure?* Ryouko thought.

*Yeah; it\'s not terribly strong anyway. Better not stay on it too long, anyway, or the backlash will get you.*

The world seemed to come slightly more into focus as the emotional suppression receded. Ryouko looked at her hand again, now clean of blood.

Outside of the moment, she felt better. Well, not really better per se---more like she could successfully disassociate herself from what had just happened by fixing her gaze squarely away from the corpses that littered the area and focusing on the task on hand.

Clarisse had already automatically coordinated which team members she would be taking---Ryouko would be taking most of the team, while Mina, by far the more experienced of the two, would take the remainder of the team and the \"prisoners\".

It was straightforward, Ryouko, Mina, and the two clairvoyants coordinating rapidly and repeatedly to perform exactly four teleports, until they found themselves in what appeared to be... living areas.

*Oh Goddess,* Mina thought, as they found themselves looking at a row of bunk beds which had clearly been hastily abandoned. Clothing lay scattered about on the floor and on the bunks, or accentuated desks piled with books and ornamental trinkets. The walls were painted a cheery pink and adorned with posters of what appeared to be the cult leader and some of the guards.

*Start your memory extraction,* Kyouko ordered, looking at Gracia.

*Already on it,* Gracia thought.

Meiqing looked away, finding a far corner of the room to study. Ryouko wouldn\'t have wanted to be in her shoes, finding out so much of this for the first time.

Marianne, for her part, was already tapping into the electronics in the walls.

*If it wouldn\'t give away where we had been, I\'d tear down these posters,* Elisa said. *It sickens me.*

*I wonder if some of the girls we... we killed lived here,* Asami thought.

Don\'t *think about it,* Nana thought immediately, grabbing the girl\'s shoulder. *Not now. There\'s no way we could have known.*

*We didn\'t have to break down the walls like that,* Ryouko thought. *If we had just teleported like we did now, they would have lost track of us.*

*We had to get there fast,* Tammy thought. *Kyouko was right. Now that they know we\'re here, anything could be happening.*

*At least these beds haven\'t been occupied for a while,* Kavitha thought. *If they were just here, the heat would show up on infrared, and it\'d be our fault they moved.*

*Damn it all, we should have realized they might detect a telepathic signal headed out,* Mina thought. *We weren\'t thinking.*

*The leadership here---* Elisa began.

*Quiet, all of you!* Nana snapped, grabbing Elisa\'s arm. *Now is not the time to do this. We stay focused on our objective, and we finish the mission. Remember your training.*

*What* is *our objective?* Elisa thought. *Are we really going to leave once we learn what happened to the children?* That *was our objective, and it certainly doesn\'t look like that\'s all we\'re doing here. We\'re winging it.*

*According to the local electronics, the girls here were age twelve to seventeen,* Marianne thought, withdrawing her strings from the walls. *I could tell you their names, but that wouldn\'t be very informative. There\'s nothing else of interest.*

*Are there any older girls?* Nana thought. *If so, where are they?*

*I don\'t know,* Marianne thought.

*Look at the posters,* Meiqing thought, pointing at one of the near walls.

They turned to look, at a holographic poster of one of the guards emblazoned with the bright white letters \"YOUR BIG SISTERS ARE HERE TO HELP.\" The guard stood posed, firing her weapon at an invisible enemy.

\"Are they training to be guards?\" Asami asked. \"For what?\"

Ryouko looked over at Kyouko. Through it all, she had merely stood silently, watching Gracia do her work. Ryouko, too, wondered about Kyouko, wondered if she was going to merely stand there quietly while all this was going on.

Finally, mercifully, Gracia withdrew her hands from the subdued guard on the ground, looking up at Kyouko.

*It\'s... worse than I thought,* she thought, voice torn. *It looks like after she began to reject her false memories, they told her that they were going take her up to her \'parents\' on the surface. Instead, they chose to install implants for total thought control. She\'s been forced to be a guard here for years. I\'m just glad she wasn\'t awake for most of it. At least her core personality circuits haven\'t degraded too much. Fortunately, this is probably repairable with microsurgery. Maybe a little magic in the worst case.*

*I didn\'t ask for her prognosis, Gracia,* Kyouko snapped, with a trace of anger.

Gracia looked up at her in shock.

*Sorry, sorry, that was uncalled for,* Kyouko thought hastily, apologetically. *The situation is getting to me.*

Gracia sucked in a breath.

*Well,* she thought. *It looks like these girls were told that the underground complex was a bit of a boarding school, focused on getting as many contracts as possible. If they didn\'t manage to contract by the end of their stay, they\'d return to the surface and return to their parents. That was the story anyway.*

Gracia took another breath, trying to calm herself.

*My guess is they couldn\'t get the memories to stabilize in the long run, so they decided to \'draft\' the older girls who were starting to develop memory problems to be guards. Two birds with one stone. It\'s disgusting.*

*How does that fit in with this, though?* thought Marianne, pointing at the \"Big Sister\" poster behind her with her thumb. *This seems to suggest they knew what was going to happen.*

Gracia shook her head.

*Maybe just a horrifying sense of humor? They were told that the guards were just female colonists. The idea was that the guards would help protect them, if the evil people outside the cult ever came for them.*

Kyouko looked down at the ground, bracing her arm on her spear.

*So how many magical girls are we going to be dealing with?* Kyouko thought. *The way potential seems to work, clones like these have a much lower contract rate than you\'d think. But even one is too many, or we wouldn\'t be in this mess.*

*That\'s the thing,* Gracia thought. *In the entire time this girl was... awake, there wasn\'t a single contract. The \'school\' administrators were getting visibly frustrated. Her memories from after becoming a guard are... sporadic, so maybe there were some contracts after that, but at least for the first five years, there was nothing.*

*Well, there\'s at least one,* Kyouko thought.

*Yes.*

Gracia let her eyes drop down towards the floor.

*Before we left those other girls behind, I think some of them were waking up,* she thought. *Nana disabled their implants, the ones that were keeping them functioning. I could hear the terror. I\'m glad I don\'t have to hear it anymore, but I\'m sorry we left them there. They can\'t even move in those suits, with their electronics disabled.*

Kyouko gritted her teeth almost audibly, and Ryouko felt an acid horror seem to well upward from inside her. Clarisse didn\'t offer to suppress her emotions, though, and Ryouko didn\'t ask. Kyouko had been right. For better or worse, she would have to learn to deal with these things as they came, without letting it inhibit her functioning.

But there were other rookies in the group.

Kyouko stood up taller, holding her spear to one side and turning to face the group. She seemed to abruptly exude leadership, and Ryouko recognized what it was---an Ancient mind trick of sorts, derived not so much from magic as from force of will, though sometimes spiked with quite a bit of magic.

*Girls,* Kyouko thought. *This is an abomination. I don\'t have to tell you that, but it goes deeper than that. When we founded the MSY, the goal was that no one should ever have to suffer as we did, ever again. We thought we had succeeded, but here we are, facing an abomination against everything the Goddess has ever stood for. These girls have suffered, but don\'t think only of their suffering. Think of all of us who have suffered, over the long arc of history, crying in the dark. We fought, and we killed, for worse reasons than the reasons we killed those guards, out in that hallway. And yet in the end we still lived. So too shall it be here. We\'re trapped here, with limited grief cubes. We cannot wait---soon, those on the surface will wonder what happened to us. Soon, they may bash down those doors, and kill all the armored guards they find inside. We have no way of warning them about the tragedy that will occur.*

Kyouko turned, pointing her spear in the general direction of where they suspected the magical girl blocking their exit was.

*We know where we must go, and in the end we may have to kill to get there. Girls who were raised here may not listen to reason and may be immune to our stunning magic. In the end, we may have to kill for the greater good. Such has it always been, and we must take solace in knowing that their sacrifice will not be in vain.*

Kyouko had walked over to Meiqing and Asami, who stood together, still with the vaguely glass‐eyed expression of the emotionally suppressed.

*Don\'t worry,* she said, grasping Asami\'s shoulder. *We can pull through this. We just have to have faith in each other. We won\'t let the crimes committed here continue, and we cannot falter.*

To Ryouko\'s jaded ears, the sermon‐of‐sorts sounded forced, even backed by an Ancient\'s considerable charisma. She could see that the other veterans felt similarly.

But Meiqing and Asami lost their glass‐eyed look, blinking up at Kyouko with what seemed to be a slight sense of wonder.

*Let\'s go, girls,* Kyouko thought. *We\'ll stay in stealth, travel the normal way, and teleport when convenient. Hopefully, we can evade any other guards and get to the bottom of this. I can\'t promise we won\'t have to kill anyone else, so I have to remind you not to hold back in a fight. Sometimes people have to die. There\'s no other way. Come on.*

Elisa and the others seemed somewhat mollified by the show of leadership, and the enunciation of what seemed to be a reasonable plan. Ryouko\'s tactical interface indicated that the group had agreed to divide into two groups centered on the two teleporters, but traveling together.

*Sometimes people have to die,* Ryouko echoed in her mind, sighing.

*I wonder,* she thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They crept their way forward through the facility, avoiding concentrations of guards, teleporting past obstacles, and generally taking what started to seem like the most circuitous possible route. It hardly fit with the idea that they needed to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and Kyouko was starting to show poorly‐concealed impatience.

Through it all, Ryouko felt a gathering sense of trepidation. It would not be long until they reached the location where Gracia had signaled they were being blocked from. It was of course entirely possible that the magical girl in question had moved, in which case Gracia would have to give away their position with another attempt at communicating with the surface, but Ryouko, and indeed the team as a whole, seemed to share an odd certainty that their quarry would be right there waiting for them.

It certainly seemed likely to be that way as they got closer to the location and the outer \"walls\" on their clairvoyance started to close in even tighter, starting to provide a serious impediment to the random jumps Ryouko and Mina were expected to make. It felt claustrophobic as a teleporter, being limited like that, which no doubt contributed to Ryouko\'s sense of apprehension.

*Whoever is exerting this suppression field must be using a tremendous amount of power,* Marianne thought as they grew close. *If we weren\'t in a hurry, we could just wait her out. She can\'t be getting many grief cubes down here.*

*I don\'t know how many demon spawns a giant group of teenage clones and mind‐controlled guards will make, but I\'m willing to bet it\'s not nothing,* Kyouko countered. *It\'s possible she has plenty to hunt down here.*

*What I want to know is, surely this colony must have had some magical girls outside the clones, right?* Nana thought. *Otherwise, why haven\'t they been destroyed by demons?*

*There were demons everywhere when we landed,* Kyouko thought. Remember? I\'m willing to bet stupid shit like this clones thing is related to that. Those things aren\'t exactly friendly on the sanity.*

*But then where are the magical girls?* Nana thought.

*I don\'t know,* Kyouko thought. *I hope we\'re not about to find out.*

*Shouldn\'t we be able to sense them by now?* Ryouko thought. *Or at least the one girl, if she\'s really burning so much power? It should be possible to sense the soul gem, unless that sense is being blocked too.*

*It probably is,* Kyouko thought, with what seemed to be a sigh.

*It looks like we\'re approaching the central geothermal borehole for this section of the bunker,* Meiqing thought. *I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s where they\'re holed up. It\'s going to be a big room, though, so be ready for that.*

*I\'m glad I brought you,* Kyouko thought, with what sounded like complete sincerity. *Otherwise we\'d be flying blind.*

Meiqing tittered nervously---not out loud.

*I... I can\'t honestly say I\'m glad to be here.*

*It\'s a learning experience, rookie,* Elisa thought. *Buck up.*

*We killed all those girls, and you want us to buck up?* Ryouko thought---to herself, not to the group.

*We\'re getting really close,* Meiqing thought. *The next room will be right up against the wall to the power facility. I don\'t think there\'s a doorway, though.*

*Just in time, too,* Mina thought. *All this teleporting is costing a lot of grief cubes.*

*We should pause in the next room, then,* Marianne thought. *I can use my strings on the wall and see through it that way, since it\'s just one wall. I bet whoever it is isn\'t literally blocking the photons landing on the wall.*

*Agreed,* Kyouko thought. *We can take a moment to regroup and plan. Not too long, though---if I were them I\'d be constantly sweeping the neighboring rooms with guards.*

A few moments later they found themselves in the room in question, an extended utility closet strewn with what appeared to be drone parts. As promised, Marianne immediately fired her strings at the opposing wall, closing her eyes.

*I\'m going to try to send you all what I\'m seeing with telepathy,* she thought. *It\'s going to take some concentration, so stand by for a moment.*

A few second later, Ryouko felt a series of mental images impinging on her mind, distracting in the same way she imagined hallucinations must be. Kyouko and the other veterans seemed unperturbed, but Ryouko found it difficult to watch her surroundings and the imagery at the same time.

*Don\'t worry about it, new girls,* Kyouko thought. *Just close your eyes for now.*

Ryouko wasn\'t sure what she had expected a geothermal borehole to look like, but she had certainly expected something a bit more interesting. Glowing lights, perhaps. Instead, the room was dominated by generic‐looking metal machinery and tubing, as well as a single large dome she assumed capped the borehole proper. Throughout the room, guards stood on watch.

In front of the dome, a single girl, dressed in a hooded black jacket and cloak, prostrated herself on a prayer rug. Her soul gem shone pure white, though, bright as a star---though Ryouko felt, somehow, that it was starting to fade.

*I think we\'ve found our magical girl,* Gracia thought, stating the obvious.

*But where are the other magical girls?* Nana thought. *There must be some! And where are the missing children and clones? All that we have here are more guards.*

*Does it matter?* Kyouko thought. *We eliminate her, we salvage this entire situation. One surgical strike ought to do it. I doubt she can focus on anything but maintaining the suppression field.*

*Something is wrong,* Nana thought. *We should capture her instead.*

*In* this *situation?* Kyouko thought, sounding appalled. *We should just kill her!*

*We can\'t just kill her like that!* Meiqing thought. *We should at least give her a chance!*

*Not now, rookie,* Kyouko thought, clearly restraining herself. *We can\'t have qualms now. There are lives in danger!*

*Ryouko! Your soul gem!* Asami thought.

That last thought, over the group telepathy network rather than sent personally to Ryouko, seemed so incongruous that it actually stopped conversation for a moment, and caused Ryouko to open her eyes, and to try to peer down at the base of her neck.

Her soul gem was glowing again---faintly, but still glowing, clearly brighter than the usual soul gem glow.

*What are you doing, Ryouko?* Elisa asked.

*No, it means something,* Gracia thought. *Haven\'t you read about the Orpheus mission? It\'s a sign from the Goddess!*

*Don\'t bring in religion at a time like this!* Elisa said, casting a sidelong glance at Kyouko---she was clearly holding back a much harsher statement.

Ryouko let out a breath, glancing warily among the other members of the team.

*No, it isn\'t,* she said. *Or at least, it doesn\'t have to be. It actually does this regularly if I\'m near something that resembles a wormhole---or at least I think. Something like a faster‐than‐light engine, or an alien wormhole. I don\'t think I see any reason why it should be glowing now, though.*

Ryouko let her words hang in the air for a moment, aware that the words she didn\'t say were almost as important as the words she did say.

*The natural conclusion is that there\'s something in the area,* Nana thought. *Would there be equipment like that in a power station like this?*

She directed the question generally, since it was not at all clear if anyone on the team was an expert in geothermal energy.

After a long moment of silence, Marianne spoke up.

*Well, I can\'t imagine why anyone would need anything resembling a faster‐than‐light engine for a geothermal borehole, unless the colonists have been experimenting with something radically new. Starship engines are expensive enough as it is---a power station that needed exotic matter to run it would negate much of the reason for its existence. Asami, can you feel anything in the area?*

Asami shook her head.

*No,* she thought. *But I haven\'t really been looking. Maybe if I had some more time...*

She allowed her voice to trail off.

*We should explore the area,* Nana thought. *Missing children, missing clones, missing magical girls---we can\'t just charge in. Asami, Ryouko, and Meiqing---we can escort them on a circuit of the perimeter.*

*It could end up being a wild goose chase,* Kyouko growled. *If we just get rid of the girl blocking us from seeing anything, we\'ll have full access to our clairvoyance, and it will no longer be an issue.*

*We\'re operating with too little information,* Marianne thought. *We have to learn what\'s going on. We can charge in and take her out anytime---it\'s not like these guards are going to be that much of an issue, even if we have to focus on disabling them instead of killing them.*

*There could be people* dying *out there,* Kyouko thought. *Every second we waste out here could be another child, and every second we spend scouting the area is another chance to get discovered.*

*We have* no *evidence for your speculation,* Nana said. *What we* do have evidence of is some kind of device in the area that shouldn\'t be there. We* have *to know what it is. Let\'s go look. This has all the signs of a trap.*

*Well, you\'re not in command here,* Kyouko said, glaring at Nana. Don\'t try to overrule me.*

Ice‐cold rage filled her words, seeming to the chill the air around them.

*Don\'t do this, Kyouko,* Marianne thought. *Mami---*

*Don\'t you start on me,* Kyouko warned.

*Just because* you *want to be a bloody idiot does not mean* we *have to follow you,* Elisa said, stepping forward next to Nana to look Kyouko in the eyes. *We\'ve followed you into this mess, but we\'re not going to follow you into an obvious trap.*

*You\'re out of line---*

*We aren\'t the military,* Nana said, stepping forward so that she was face to face with Kyouko. *We\'re not the same. Now back off---*

Kyouko let out a cry of frustration, pushing Nana away from her. Without really knowing what she was doing, Ryouko lunged forward, grabbing Kyouko\'s arm, and realized only afterward that she had stopped Kyouko from throwing her spear into the floor. For a moment, she gritted her teeth, feeling her magically enhanced muscles straining to restrain Kyouko\'s, student against mentor.

*Please listen to me,* Ryouko thought. *You\'re letting your history get to you. When you brought me here, you kept saying the Goddess had some plan for me. Well, maybe the Goddess\'s plan was to keep you from getting yourself killed. If my soul gem says there\'s something in the area, then we need to find it.*

She met Kyouko\'s eyes, engaging her in a battle of will for the first time, and realized that she was not seeing the implacable, unmovable Ancient she expected, but someone much weaker, and *much* more vulnerable.

*Please,* Ryouko appended.

For a moment she thought she had made a terrible mistake, but then she felt Kyouko\'s arm slacken and drop.

She looked away.

*Alright,* she thought. *We\'ll take a circuit of the perimeter. Stay frosty---they\'ll be plenty of guards around. We don\'t want to do anything stupid like get their attention by hurling our weapons into the floor. Ryouko, do you think you can track the signal?*

The question surprised Ryouko, who was at a loss for a moment before managing to answer:

*Maybe. It depends on what this is. Now that I\'m paying attention to my soul gem, I might be able to pick up if we get closer to it, but we\'ll have to move around.*

*Alright then; let\'s go. Let\'s do this quickly. Time is still of the essence.*

No apologies. Not even an acknowledgment that anything had happened---but it was good enough, and the team let out a collective sigh.

Ryouko nodded, allowing the others to gather around her, waiting for the clairvoyants to choose an unmonitored location to teleport to. Asami and Meiqing, the other magical girls they\'d be relying on to scan the perimeter, each grabbed one of her arms, and for a moment Ryouko could almost imagine that they were still in training, practicing for a new type of mission.

But they weren\'t, of course. No training mission would have had anything like what she had just experienced. There were certain things that just couldn\'t be prepared for.

*Got it,* Gracia thought, indicating that she had a place for them to go.

Marianne verified the location a moment later, and Ryouko ducked her head, preparing for the jump. It had taken unusually long for the clairvoyants to find a safe location---Kyouko had been right about one thing: the facility garrison wasn\'t taking any chances with the power station. If anything, the density of the patrols had only increased, with the guards even going so far as to physically walk through every room they inspected. It was evident that they were worried Ryouko and the others would find the power station, but there was no sign yet that they knew their magical girl had been detected.

After the teleport had completed, Ryouko immediately glanced down at her soul gem. It was brighter, but---

No. There was something there, at the edges of her awareness, but where?

She opened her eyes, looking around at Meiqing and Asami. They shook their heads.

*Nothing,* Asami thought. *It\'s strange. I don\'t think we\'ve ever disagreed about something like this.*

Ryouko took a moment to evaluate her new surroundings. According to her internal map, which was based on information from the clairvoyants, they had sidestepped a small distance along the edge of the station, and also gone up about two stories. They were still next to the power station, though, since the station was tall as well as wide.

Now they stood in a narrow, dimly lit causeway, with an unusually low ceiling. It was likely that it was a service corridor of some sort, intended more for drones than humans.

That didn\'t mean it was particularly safe, though, a point accentuated by a small, empty cargo drone that skittered through their area, forcing Elisa to step around it and let it pass so their stealth wouldn\'t be breached.

*We should move on,* Kyouko thought. *Since the signal got stronger, let\'s just keep heading in the same direction. It\'s not safe to stand here.*

Ryouko held up her hand to wave off the idea.

*I think I might be able to figure out where it is, if you just give a moment to concentrate,* she thought. *Please.*

She closed her eyes, trying to remember the state of mind she had used when she reopened the wormhole. What was it that Clarisse had said?

That she should empty her mind, and try to focus on nothing but the magic.

It had been a stressful day, to put it mildly. She hadn\'t realized until she tried to relax just how tense she was. A thousand things to worry about, a thousand disasters looming, chaos and confusion, Kyouko and Asami and the clones---

She shook her head at herself, feeling her hair unravel itself. There was only her breath moving in and out, the sharp glow of her soul gem, the thrumming of all the other soul gems next to her, some quiet and muted, others straining with effort to sustain the magic that kept them hidden. Behind it all was the stolid, flat gravity of the planet that surrounded them, unchanging except for whispers of activity, the shifting of distant oceans---

*I have it,* she said, opening her eyes abruptly. *Whatever it is, it\'s just above us, right on top of the power plant.*

She labeled the approximate location on their internal maps.

*On top?* Marianne thought. *What could be up there?*

*I guess we\'ll find out,* Kyouko thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*We\'re almost directly on top of her,* Nana thought, three teleports later.

*Her?* Kavitha thought.

*The girl casting the suppression field,* Nana thought. *We\'re almost right on top of her.*

*Do you think it means anything?* Kyouko asked.

*I don\'t know.*

Ryouko looked around. By now they were clearly outside of the inhabited parts of the facility. Except for the floor they stood on, they were surrounded on all sides by carefully shaped rock, along with numerous support beams and shock absorbers. Ryouko\'s soul gem was now glowing brightly, and it was easy for her to tell that there was something in front of her, inside what looked like a solid wall of rock.

Meiqing and Asami held almost identical expressions of consternation and concentration, and it was clear something was wrong.

*I don\'t understand,* Meiqing thought. *It\'s not that I can tell there\'s anything there---it\'s more like there\'s more* not *there than there should be. It\'s like this part of the planet is shaped wrong, and the parts don\'t connect somehow.*

*There\'s definitely something there,* Asami thought, immediately afterward. *It feels really familiar, and I don\'t know why I didn\'t feel it before.*

*It looks normal enough to me,* Gracia said. *Rock, rock, and more rock. That doesn\'t mean there\'s nothing there, but it\'s difficult to do a thorough search when you have no idea which part of it you\'re looking at.*

There was nothing to do but wait, really. At Kyouko\'s nod, Meiqing and Asami pressed themselves literally up against the rock surface, for all the world as if they might be able to go through it if they pressed hard enough.

*Well?* Kyouko thought.

*It reminds me of being with the Magi Cæli,* Asami thought. *Something I felt while I was there, but for some reason I can\'t pinpoint---oh. Oh.*

Everyone in the area immediately turned their heads to look at Asami, who seemed to shrink away from the scrutiny.

*I\'ve realized,* she said, looking away. *I\'ve only ever really seen ships. *And ships have FTL engines which are bright and obvious to me, even behind stealth. Squid stealth is actually really good though, and usually the only thing I ever pick up is the engines, and a faint trace of... well, something like this. I think it might be a stealth device.*

*A squid stealth device? Here?* Kyouko asked incredulously.

*Or something really similar. I don\'t know. But that\'s what it reminds me of.*

*I still can\'t see it,* Gracia thought, *but depending on the type of stealth, it might take me a while, especially if it\'s small. I have to basically scan every spot for it.*

*Same story for me,* Marianne thought, her strings already attached to the rock surface. *If it were visible or electronic, I could see it that way, but this is just normal rock, and apparently it\'s not visible.*

*Since we do have a vague idea of where it is, I could straight‐up blast this rock with my technology‐disabling magic,* Nana thought. *Of course, anyone monitoring it would notice right away, so it\'s not exactly a safe option.*

Kyouko visibly gritted her teeth.

*How long would it take to complete a search of this rock with clairvoyance?* she thought.

*With the two of us? With a grid search, maybe half an hour,* Gracia thought. *We have to literally try and look at portions of rock individually, so it depends on how big whatever it is turns out to be. I could also find it in the next thirty seconds. Or it could be an hour. It\'s tough to say. We just didn\'t bring the right type of clairvoyant.*

*Whatever this is, I doubt it\'s a red herring,* Elisa thought. *If you think about it, we got lucky to even notice it was there. And no one knows how to make or imitate a squid stealth device. That would require its own research project. No way this is just some kind of trap to draw us out.*

*There are a lot of questions here, that\'s for sure,* Tammy thought.

Kyouko looked down for a moment, rubbing her eyes in consternation, as if exceedingly tired. Ryouko could sympathize: there were too many decisions to be made on too little information, and despite the mini‐revolt against Kyouko\'s leadership earlier, it was still incumbent on Kyouko to make those decisions.

Finally, she looked up.

*I\'m going to take a leap of faith,* she said. *You were right, Ryouko. The chain of events leading to you being here could have only happened after you reported your vision to us. I will take that as a sign that whatever this is is important, because it came from you. And we can\'t afford a thirty‐minute wait. Nana, blast the rock. With any luck, no one will be watching the thing that carefully anyway. And I* don\'t *want to hear anything from any of you about my religion.*

*Well, it\'s an okay decision on its own merits,* Marianne thought. Though I don\'t think anyone knows the right choice here.*

*Be on your toes, girls,* Kyouko said as Nana took a breath, gathering a ball of purple energy in front of her with two hands. *We may have to get out of here pretty damn fast. If the alarm goes up, we might have to launch an immediate attack on the girl down there, in case she tries to flee. Teleporters be ready. At least if she runs we\'ll probably have full clairvoyance again.*

A moment later, Nana released her charge, the purple glow burying itself into the surface of the rock and disappearing.

There was a moment of anticlimax as nothing seemed to happen.

Then, all at once, alarms bells rang in their heads, as their internal radiation monitors lit up with warnings of the telltale signature of a nuclear device, right in front of them.

*Nuclear device, unknown status, hidden behind novel stealth device, Gracia thought, forwarding them images of the device as she saw them. It looks human in manufacture, but I don\'t know---*

*Can it still go off?* Kyouko demanded, already pointing her spear at the rock in a gesture of desperation.

*No! It can\'t!* Nana thought, forestalling a whole team\'s worth of responses. *My powers specifically disable all technology more recent than July 1945. That includes nuclear weapons! As long as no one slaps the pieces of uranium together, we\'re fine. It\'s a good thing this wasn\'t antimatter, or I would have just ruptured the containment.*

*They\'re not supposed to have any nuclear weapons!* Xochi thought. *The sensors---*

*You can\'t rely on the sensors!* Agnes snapped back. *Not when you have people building crazy---*

*Everyone calm down!* Kyouko ordered. *Now that it\'s disabled, we can take it out! Meiqing!*

*I\'m on it,* Meiqing thought.

Then, a moment later:

*It\'s crushed. It won\'t fire anytime soon.*

*The suppression field is down!* Marianne thought. *I can see! They\'re on alert!*

*Alright,* Kyouko thought. *We have to move. Let\'s see---*

*Hello? Hello? You disabled the bomb?* a new telepathic voice rang out, from far below them. *Thank the heavens! Get me out of here, please! Before---*

The voice cut off abruptly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They rematerialized inside the power plant in the air, far above the girl who had been casting the suppression field. As the others descended on the surrounding area like avenging angels, Ryouko instead teleported again, straight to the ground with Xochi, one of the stealth generators, and Marianne. In a battle where the goal was disabling the enemy, Ryouko found her powers relatively useless---the best she could do was teleport to enemies and apply a careful blow to the head, seeking a knockout. It was hardly a certain maneuver, especially when it had to be done through armor.

Instead she was assigned to check on the magical girl who had called out to them, who was now collapsed on her prayer rug, not casting a suppression field or anything else.

Ryouko took a moment to glance around her quickly, at Nana, who was blasting the area with a wide‐angle disabling field, and Gracia, who was mind‐controlling everyone she could, and Kyouko, who was keeping the guards distracted with her duplicates.

Then she and Marianne knelt carefully next to the girl, still stealthed, while Xochi watched the area for danger.

She reached immediately for the girl\'s soul gem on the left of her chest, buried in her robe‐like costume. Pulling it off, she realized it was swirling with corruption. They had barely gotten there in time.

*I\'m not surprised,* Marianne said. *With the kind of power she was using, I\'m impressed she hasn\'t given out already. Here, I have a few spares.*

Ryouko placed the soul gem into a pouch hidden in her costume, along with the grief cubes. It would need more than that to reach full cleanliness, but it would be enough for now.

\"Why would she do all this, then ask us for help?\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Marianne said, grabbing the girl by the back of the neck, extending her strings to the rear spinal port.

With a spasm, the girl started breathing again, causing Ryouko to realize that she *hadn\'t* been, not up until then.

*Looks like her internal implants tried to activate a suicide module, Marianne thought. *Fortunately, that doesn\'t actually ever work on a magical girl. With her soul gem recovering, the implants in question will probably get dissolved by her magic.*

The girl opened her eyes then, but Ryouko was ready, pulling out the girl\'s soul gem and holding it in her hand. Xochi moved to pin down the girl\'s arms with her feet.

\"Hold still. One move and she\'s crushing your gem,\" Marianne said. "It will kill you. What the hell were you doing here? Why did you ask for help?\"

\"I\'m... still alive?\" the girl said. \"The suicide implant should have killed me.\"

\"That doesn\'t work on magical girls. You want to finish yourself off, you should have crushed your soul gem,\" Marianne said.

The girl started crying softly, tears flooding out of her eyes in a steady torrent, washing into the bangs she had tucked behind her ears. Her costume looked like a modern interpretation of desert robes, or the clothing popular on Nova Terra, cascading over her limbs down the floor. It was then that Ryouko realized how *young* the girl looked. She looked eleven, twelve at the most, and for once Ryouko had no doubt that it reflected the girl\'s actual age.

*Easy there,* Clarisse thought. *You were twelve not so long ago.*

*There\'s a difference between being fifteen and going through all this shit, and being twelve,* Ryouko snapped back.

*I suppose I can\'t dispute that,* Clarisse thought.

\"It\'s that easy?\" the girl choked out. \"I listened to his damn voice for that long for *nothing*? I could have just disobeyed?\"

Ryouko and Marianne shared a quick glance.

\"What do you mean?\" Marianne asked. \"No, never mind, not yet. Where are the colony\'s children? Where are all the girls that lived down here? I don\'t want to rush you, but we\'re in a hurry to find them. Was someone forcing you to cast the suppression field?\"

Ryouko noticed Marianne hesitate slightly between her sentences, and could hear what she was leaving out: clones, the guards.

The girl looked around her, at first tormented, then relieved.

\"Don\'t kill the guards,\" she said. \"They\'re clones. He put implants---\"

\"We know!\" Marianne said, grabbing the girl by the shoulders. \"We know. Tell us where he took---\"

\"I didn\'t know!\" she said, putting her hands to her face in visible agony. \"He didn\'t tell us! I saw---I saw what he did to the older girls, and I wished for the Incubator to end the horror, and *nothing happened.* He told me that we have implants in our heads so we have to do what he says---all he has to do is push the button. So I did what he told me and---\"

\"You *don\'t* have to listen to him,\" Marianne said, trying to pin the girl with her eyes. \"Tell us where the children and clones are, and we\'ll save them. Are they farther down?\"

The girl shook her head, tears still welling in her eyes, hair tumbling around her.

\"I don\'t know why, but they started saying the Enemy was coming for us, and we had to be brave. They turned my friends---my *sisters* into the guards around me.\"

Marianne looked at the battle around them, which was turning decisively in their favor, as expected, in large part because Meiqing had deliberately destroyed all the entrances into the power facility.

\"So those are your sisters?\" she said.

\"Yes,\" the girl said, nodding.

She jerked forward, grabbing Marianne by the arm, scaring Ryouko so much that her hand actually twitched around the girl\'s soul gem.

\"We believed in him,\" the girl said. \"He told us you were evil, and I believed him. Why wouldn\'t I? I---we remembered our parents on the surface. If I didn\'t know the truth, I---\"

\"Focus,\" Marianne insisted. \"Focus. The children from the colony above are missing, and we don\'t know where the man leading all this is. If they\'re not deeper down, then where are they?\"

\"This was supposed to be a trap,\" the girl said. \"The point was to lure as many of you down here as possible, then when I died, the bomb was going to go off and kill you all. I didn\'t know what to do. His voice was always in my head, telling me what to do, and if I didn\'t listen, the implants would kill me and set off the bomb. I couldn\'t even think with his voice in my head.\"

Marianne gritted her teeth.

*She could have overridden these implants easily with a bit of magic, she thought to Ryouko. *But she had no way of knowing that. Don\'t tell her.*

*How could she even try?* Ryouko thought. *And risk setting off the nuke?*

\"Where are the children---\" Marianne repeated to the girl, one last time.

\"Not here,\" the girl said. \"They were never here. He made it look like they came down here, then he changed everyone\'s memories so they\'d say he was down here, but I remember. I read his mind, a little. A base on the other side of the planet.\"

Marianne let out a breath.

*So it was a trap after all,* she thought. *It\'s a good thing you noticed the bomb.*

Ryouko nodded vaguely, thinking about her soul gem, and the Goddess. Kyouko had been right. She was here for a reason, despite everything.

It was strangely comforting, in a way. She had hated the idea that anyone was directing her life, but she saw now that when the world was going to hell, it felt good to have an assurance that whatever you were doing was for the best, at least according to someone\'s conception of "the best\".

She didn\'t like the sense of relief it gave her.

\"Do you know where he went?\" Marianne asked.

The girl shook her head.

\"I only know it\'s underground,\" she said.

Marianne nodded, then dipped her head for a moment, seeming to lapse into thought.

A flash of red next to Ryouko almost startled her into jumping, but it was only Kyouko, whose arrival signaled that the battle around them was over.

\"So what news?\" Kyouko asked, keeping her spear pointed at the girl sitting up from the floor. \"Everyone is desperate to know what\'s going on here.\"

With the suppression field down, one of their first actions had been to make brief telepathic contact with the surface, letting them know the team was alright. Since then, they had been bombarded with telepathic messages from the surface that they simply did not have time to answer in detail, engaged as they were in active contact.

\"There\'s a lot to discuss,\" Marianne said. \"But the upshot is that the cult leader and the children aren\'t here. They\'re hidden on a separate part of the planet. The colonists here have either been tricked or brainwashed into thinking the children were down here, but this is really a giant trap. At least, that\'s what she says.\"

Marianne looked down, regarding the girl on the floor, sneaking a quick glance at Ryouko.

\"Okay, I\'m here,\" Gracia said, dropping out of the air a moment later.

Marianne gestured at the girl on the floor.

\"I\'m sorry to do this to you,\" she said. \"But what\'s going on here is too important for us to just take your word on this.\"

\"I don\'t get what you mean,\" the girl said, as Gracia knelt down beside her.

Ryouko did, and the cold logic of it turned her stomach, just a little. It made sense, but it just seemed so... cruel.

She knelt down next to the girl, meeting her searching eyes with what she hoped was a reassuring look.

\"What\'s your name?\" Ryouko asked.

\"My name. Ah, well, they told me my name was Sacnite. Sacnite Tafani.\"

The girl hugged her knees for a moment.

\"I don\'t know what to think of that, though. I can still remember my parents telling me about my name, and why they chose it. \'White Flower\', they said. But I know that memory isn\'t real, and I know they don\'t even know I exist down here. It\'s someone else\'s life, but I... I still can\'t help thinking of them as my parents.\"

Ryouko looked down for a moment, at the pale gray flooring of the power plant. She didn\'t know what to think about the situation, so she supposed it was better to think nothing.

She stood back up a moment later.

\"Wishes always come true,\" she said, peering down on Sacnite. \"Have faith in that.\"

Then she walked away, because she couldn\'t stand to see it anymore.

Though unauthorized Reformatting is subject to strict penalties, even when done with consent, only a few prosecutions have ever been carried out. It is believed that black market or even self‐Reformatting represent a substantial number of unrecorded cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They returned to the surface for debriefing a short while after Gracia\'s \"interrogation\" of Sacnite. Without the suppression field, the invasion force\'s teleporters and clairvoyants were now free to operate, and teams of magical girls probed the underground complex, capturing and retrieving the guards that were still wandering, devoid of a central mission. There was no controlling AI here, just what were effectively drones, programmed to follow a plan that was no longer relevant.

With the main colony now firmly under Governance control, individual clairvoyants fanned out across the surface of the planet, searching for the elusive second base where the cult leader DeWitt was holed up with the colonists\' children. Governance satellites and ships had naturally already scanned most of the planet, but had thus far failed to find anything of note. It was considered a likely possibility that this second base was cloaked with the same technology that had concealed the nuclear device, which is why it was necessary to send out whatever clairvoyants they could. It would still be a massive search operation, though, and desperate in the knowledge that the cult leader could be doing anything in the interim.

Another likely possibility, one that they were hoping wasn\'t true, was that DeWitt had managed to trick Sacnite and simply left the planet altogether, escaping in a cloaked ship.

Questions still abounded, of course, most prominently the seemingly impossible access to resources and technology the colony had displayed, including technology Governance itself had no access to, and would be greatly desirous of acquiring---the stealth device surrounding the nuke had already been retrieved, the engineers lamenting Meiqing\'s hasty crushing of the prize, along with the radiation damage from the sub‐critical uranium.

\"I wonder what\'s going to happen to all those clones,\" Meiqing said out loud, cradling a cup of Chinese rice wine. \"Even with all that happened to them, many of them are still going to be loyal to the cult. I doubt they\'re going to believe the things they\'re being told.\"

Ryouko had never known Meiqing to drink and disapproved---but what was there to say? A lot had happened.

\"It should be possible to reveal their memories as fake with a session from one of the MSY telepaths, though it\'s going to take a while, with the number of girls involved. I don\'t want to have to be the one to see the looks on their faces, though. I\'m glad we have... professionals to deal with it.\"

\"You\'re forgetting about the guards,\" Asami said. \"They\'ll definitely believe us, but---\"

\"The important thing is not whether they believe us, but the damage that\'s been done to them,\" Meiqing said. \"I asked Gracia. She said that spending that long with your consciousness suppressed eventually degrades your core brain circuits. The older ones are going to be spending time with neurosurgeons and healers. The damage wouldn\'t even be repairable without magical healers, since otherwise the information would be lost forever.\"

Ryouko glanced at her friend, whose eyes looked subdued and exhausted. She regretted that her friend had been forced to experience this, since she had probably been roped in by her connection to Ryouko, not just her earth‐related powers.

In the end, though, Meiqing had been indispensable to the mission, just as Ryouko had been. The Goddess had foreseen it all.

\"It looks like I\'m getting some leave time after this,\" Meiqing said, unprompted. \"Time to go home, get pampered by my parents, and get prodded by my designated therapist. Honestly, I\'d hoped I\'d never have to see her again after our introduction, but here I am. I need it, to be honest.\"

There was a lot left unsaid in her words. How little she had been prepared to experience all this, even compared to Ryouko and Asami. The many truths she had never wanted to face.

Meiqing looked down into her drink.

\"I wonder how common it is, to want another wish after your first one. I thought it would be enough, saving my family\'s mining companies. I thought, I could come out here and fight, with no regrets. Instead...\"

Meiqing\'s voice trailed off, as her two friends looked on in concern.

\"What would you want to wish for?\" Asami prompted. \"If it\'s not too much to ask, that is.\"

Meiqing spun her cup slowly in her hand.

\"I\'d want to rewrite history, and give those clones the lives they never had,\" Meiqing said, looking up and smiling wanly. \"A bit ambitious, right? I\'m not sure I\'d quite have the potential to pull it off, even if I still had a wish to spare.\"

Ryouko bit back a comment about the ambiguous nature of potential, ducking her head to hide the gesture.

\"I wonder...\" Ryouko began, after a long moment of silence.

The other two looked at her, as she continued to formulate her thoughts in silence.

\"I wonder if they\'d let us visit Sacnite,\" she said, finally, looking back up at the eyes of her friends. \"I think it would be good for all of us to talk to her again, and see that she\'s doing alright.\"

Meiqing\'s eyes perked up in hope for a moment.

\"Why do you think they\'ll let us talk to her?\" Asami asked. \"If I were them, I wouldn\'t let anyone talk to her. They\'re probably not done examining her memories, or doing whatever interrogation they want to do. I\'m not sure I\'d want to see any of it.\"

The implied cynicism of Asami\'s words chilled Ryouko. This mission had taken something out of all of them.

*And to think it\'s not even over yet,* she thought. They still hadn\'t found where the cult leader was hiding, or any of the children they had supposedly set out to save.

\"Well, I think if anyone can get in to talk to her, it\'s me, and us,\" Ryouko said, realizing that she was placing herself on a bit of an invisible platform. \"Let me talk to Kyouko, or Mami, and maybe something will happen.\"

\"Only if the MHD approves it,\" Meiqing grumbled.

\"Probably,\" Ryouko agreed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami cleared her throat, buying herself just a moment of time. Four and a half centuries of life, and she still wasn\'t really used to talking to large groups of people.

It had to be done, though, just like everything.

She looked out over the crowd of reporter and blogger avatars seated in front of her, gathered to hear a special announcement from the Chair of the General Staff. The press conference was a formality, but being allowed to sit in on Armed Forces Announcements was considered a major token of accomplishment, as well as of a certain degree of access to Governance. Right there in the front row she could see prominent military blogger Avnit Hassan, as well as Agatha Amaranth, one of the top reporters for the Armed Forces Network. Mami exchanged glances with Agatha for a moment, nodding knowingly. Openly one of the mouthpieces of Governance, AFN had the privilege of receiving many press releases ahead of time, including this one.

\"Citizens of Governance,\" she addressed, reading directly off of a speech prepared for her by her staff. \"Approximately two weeks ago, an astronomical survey probe detected a radio signal emanating from an unexplored system deep within the relatively unsettled Rhine Sector. The signal was of unambiguously human origin, and contained only the text 'SOS Ordo Illustrata\' on repeat. With little other context to go on, we could only conclude the signal had something to do with a fringe religious cult that had once been situated on Optatum, and whose colonization ship had disappeared in 2442, the presumed victims of a Cephalopod attack.\"

Mami paused, looking around at the crowd of reporters, who were surprised and startled to be hearing something other than the usual run of alien war stories. A moment later, she continued:

\"Regardless of the likely source, it was necessary to investigate the situation. A sensor probe sent to the planet shortly afterward was able to discern an unauthorized colony on the surface of a planet within the Rhine Sector, as well as a large underground structure of unknown purpose. Before more could be discovered, attack satellites launched by the colonists intervened, so the probe was forced to evacuate.\"

\"As everyone well knows, Governance and the Armed Forces do not take the forming of unauthorized colonies lightly. Given the circumstances, it was deemed necessary to intervene as soon as possible, a feat which has been performed rapidly and efficiently over the past twenty‐four hours, and not a moment too soon, as events would clearly illustrate.\"

Mami took a rhetorical breath, knowing that the next section was the most important.

\"The colony was found to indeed be the site of the Ordo Illustrata, as suggested by the message. In order to penetrate the mysterious underground compound, we sent in a special operations team composed of some of our most experienced commandos, including the Hero of Orpheus herself. There, they were able to disable a WMD‐trap the cultists had set, but they also discovered something truly shocking.\"

She put her arms on the podium, making a show of collecting herself.

\"Apparently, the cultists had been cloning young girls *en masse,* in an attempt to engineer magical girl contracts, using implanted memories. This is, I want to make clear, something that fundamentally will not work, but they apparently did not know this. Further, even after this grotesque violation of the Core Rights, they went even *further, choosing to perform implant‐mediated mind‐control on those girls whose altered memories began to fail. It was beyond disgusting.\"

Sucking in a deep breath, Mami did not have to fake her barely‐controlled outrage. When she had first heard the news, Machina had put her into emotional suppression for the first time since she had gotten the TacComp implants. It had been... an interesting experience, one that remained a bit of a blur to her.

At this point the reporters in the room had transitioned from merely startled to downright shocked. Many shared Mami\'s expression of disgust, and all of them were in tense communication with whatever organizations they represented---all except Agatha, who played along with the other\'s reactions, even as the Armed Forces Network was already pushing out articles and special features, far ahead of everyone else.

After a suitably long pause, she continued:

\"I am pleased to report that the cultists have been neutralized with a minimum of casualties, and that most of the cloned girls are now safely in our custody. They will be undergoing our best medical and psychiatric therapy, and our specialists are confident that they will go on to live happy, productive lives once they can be inserted into general society. For their privacy and protection, we will not be allowing members of the media access to them, nor will we permit direct interviews. That will be their own decision to make, when the time comes. Even now, our forces continue to scour the planet for any additional cultists or underground bases.\"

Mami bent her head for a moment.

\"And now my representative will take questions,\" she said. \"Keep in mind that many additional details will be forthcoming soon.\"

She dissolved her avatar out of the simulation, and her press secretary took the press, but she kept her field of vision on the assembled reporters.

Her announcement had been terse and short on details, but that was fairly typical for announcements nowadays. It was understood that the majority of the particulars would be included in the official press release, or relayed outward by other channels. There was no need to waste anyone\'s virtual breath on all those manifold details.

She watched her representative demur question after question with \"That is not yet known.\" and \"I am not privileged to reveal that information.\"

It had still been a press conference as much characterized by what she was leaving out as by what she had revealed. Every word of it was carefully crafted to present Governance in the best possible light, to take advantage of the opportunity for a propaganda win instead of trying to undertake the arduous task of a complete cover‐up.

Over the next couple of days the media frenzy would grow enormous, but, denied access to anyone participating in the operation or any information about the location of the operation, they would have nothing to go on other than what Governance or perhaps the MSY chose to feed them. There would be images and holos of the cloning chambers, of hollow‐eyed girls in armor suits---features carefully modified to conceal their future identities---all the nightmares of the Freedom Alliance coming alive again. There would be magical girls from MagOps and psychiatrists talking to tearful rescued clones. There would be repentant cultists talking about the horrors of the colony.

There would be no mention of the missing children until they were found, no mention of the colonists\' unusual resistance, no mention of the unusual stealth device, no mention of a myriad of details that were still puzzling even to Governance.

All half‐truths, but there was nothing the media could do to prove anything otherwise. In that sense, it was fortunate everything had happened on a remote world in the Rhine Sector, where the military could cordon off everything with little fuss.

There would have to be a mention of the magical girl, of course---Sacnite, if the therapists decided she should keep the name. It was the only explanation for the mysterious radio signal, and it made for excellent pageantry. There was still the problem of how best to break that revelation to the public, but Mami already had an idea for that.

Mami shook her head at herself, wondering what the Mami that had made her wish would think of her now.

*Used car salesman...*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I can\'t believe that actually worked,\" Meiqing said, as they waited outside the suite on board the cruiser Hammurabi, where Sacnite was being kept.

\"What? You doubt Ryouko\'s influence?\" Asami asked, smilingly teasing.

Meiqing rolled her eyes.

\"Yes, I doubted her influence, and I was wrong. I can see you two will have a happy future together.\"

Ryouko ignored the banter, preferring to spend her time thinking about what to say to Sacnite. In truth, she had thought up this meeting on the spur of the moment, and hadn\'t really expected either Kyouko or Mami to be responsive---she had been shocked when Mami had actually written back, saying she\'d be glad to arrange for them to have another meeting with Sacnite, pending MHD approval.

A moment later she looked up, sensing someone approaching, the long empty corridors of the immense cruiser lighting up with their approach.

\"Azrael,\" Meiqing said, greeting the newcomer. \"What a surprise to see you here!\"

For her part, Azrael glanced between the three of them with surprised, wide eyes, causing Ryouko to realize for the first time just how *large Azrael\'s eyes were---almost on the brink of being inhuman, one might say.

\"Well, I\'m here to talk to Sacnite,\" Azrael said, sounding nervous. "For a propaganda shoot, I guess, though also to try and comfort her, you know, with the whole rogue colony thing. It doesn\'t really make sense, since if it\'s being released to the public I can\'t really talk about my background, but Mami says I\'m photogenic, as long as they\'re careful to edit out the hump on my back. I didn\'t know you\'d be here.\"

Azrael looked away from the three of them, seemingly distracted. Something seemed wrong with her, but at the moment Ryouko was more concerned with what she had said.

\"A propaganda shoot?\" Ryouko echoed. \"We\'re being recorded?\"

\"You didn\'t know?\" Azrael asked, looking at her in confusion. \"The military wants to have videos of us interacting with Sacnite, so we can look like we\'re really trying to help. But then, I guess they didn\'t tell me you\'d be here. I---\"

Azrael\'s eyes lost focus for a moment, looking at the ceiling. Ryouko felt the soft sensation of a new message arriving in her inbox.

\"Oh, there\'s the official orders,\" Azrael said. \"Wonder why it took this long.\"

\"Propaganda?\" Meiqing asked incredulously. \"I\'m not going to fake---\"

\"No, no, it\'s not like that,\" Azrael said, waving her hand at the other girl. \"If they wanted to fake anything, they\'d get professional actors. For people like us, they\'ll just want us to be ourselves, then they\'ll use the footage however they like. Read the orders.\"

Ryouko already had, finding little of note other than that there *were orders, along with the standard admonishments to keep a lid on sensitive facts.

\"I\'m surprised they were willing to go public with what happened here,\" Asami said. \"You would think that if they\'d keep anything a secret, they\'d keep this a secret.\"

\"It was too big,\" Azrael said. \"Could they have done it if they had tried? Probably. But it\'s not worth going to all that trouble when they could control the story instead, and make it the heroic military going in to save terrified cloned teenagers. Really, it could not have possibly worked out better for Governance and the MSY. The Hero of Orpheus, Mami, a crazy religious cult, evil cloning. Not enough gray to stand out unless you really look for it. Not like, you know, my home planet.\"

Azrael said it matter‐of‐factly, but the reminder of her history put a brief chill on the conversation, as the others struggled to think up what to say in response.

\"So what were you, uh, up to during the landing?\" Ryouko asked finally.

\"It was kind of boring, to be honest,\" Azrael said. \"I\'m trained mostly as an infiltrator. In this case, I was supposed to talk to and deal with any magical girls that showed up from the colony. None ever did, so I ended up doing some fire support, then cooling my heels while we waited for you guys to send a message. Underground chambers aren\'t a great place for someone with wings. It makes me shudder just thinking about it.\"

Meiqing looked about to say something, but the door next to them slid open and Sacnite\'s new live‐in minder stuck her head out.

\"Alright, I think we\'re ready for you. Come on in!\"

The group of four stepped into the doorway, a bit wary of the minder, a cheerful looking, middle‐aged blond woman who, according to the nomenclator, was also a magical girl more than three times as old as all of them combined.

\"Now obviously she\'s a bit distressed by all that has happened,\" the minder whispered to them. \"I\'ve tried to give her a comfortable environment, to ease the transition to her new life. It\'s not easy, since I have to try not to remind her of her false memories, you know, but that\'s for others to try to work with.\"

She guided them past the living area to two bedrooms in the back, pointing them towards the one on the left.

\"She\'s waiting for you in there. I\'ll leave you to your privacy. I left you some of my famous scones and tea for snacks. Look forward to that.\"

The woman trotted away, leaving the four other magical girls blinking. She had seemed like a bit of a doting mother‐figure, but something about the way she carried herself...

*She could probably kill us all with a thought,* Azrael thought, following their gazes. *But let\'s not dwell on it.*

The door in front of them was still closed, so Azrael waved it open and stepped inside, pulling the other three with her.

They found Sacnite seated on her bed idly chewing on a scone, dressed now in a loose skirt and button‐down shirt.

She looked... okay. Not great.

The girl waved vaguely for the four of them to sit, and a set of four chairs assembled themselves on the spot, from a large set of smartblocks that had been thoughtfully left in the corner of the room. As they sat, a table assembled itself in their middle.

\"I like this furniture,\" Sacnite said airily. \"We didn\'t have anything like that down at the colony. Not on the surface either, if these memories are anything to go by.\"

\"How are you holding up?\" Ryouko asked. \"You doing okay?\"

Sacnite glanced down for a moment.

\"I\'ve had some time to think about things,\" she said, leaning over towards Ryouko. \"I, uh, wanted to say...\"

The girl sucked in a breath.

\"They told me you\'re the only reason I\'m still alive. They said your team was going to kill me, until you stopped them.\"

Ryouko looked away, a little embarrassed.

\"I wouldn\'t put it that way. I wasn\'t trying to save you. I was just... responding to events.\"

\"I\'m thankful. There were times, earlier, when I thought about how much better it would be to end it all. But, in the end, I couldn\'t do it. I wanted to live.\"

Ryouko closed her eyes. The words hurt to hear, because she knew Sacnite was only a child, even compared to her. The way she spoke sounded like she had discussed it once already, probably with the platoon of psychiatrists that had descended upon the cloned girls. In a certain way, Sacnite was even younger than she should have been, because most of her memories were false, and even her ability to speak had probably been directly wired into her brain.

\"I\'m sorry you had to go through all that,\" Asami said, sounding shaky.

\"Oh, I\'m sorry,\" Ryouko said, opening her eyes. \"These are my friends, who were also on the team, except for Azrael. She\'s, uh, just someone I know.\"

Azrael smiled politely.

\"I was also born on a colony world that, hmm, also didn\'t work out,\" she said. \"I have good memories of my home, though, so I can\'t say my situation is like yours. That was quite a few years ago, though.\"

\"Don\'t worry,\" she appended, looking at the others. \"Like I said, they\'re going to edit afterward, so it doesn\'t much matter what we say.\"

\"I have good memories too,\" Sacnite said bitterly. \"It\'s just that none of them are real. Even then, I\'d hold onto them if I could, but I can\'t.\"

The raw anger of the comment was startling enough that Ryouko turned her head slightly, catching a glimpse of the girl\'s face. Though her words had been clear, her face had the frustrated, pained look of someone trying to hold back tears.

Ryouko looked around for someone seated farther away to bail her out, but Meiqing and Asami looked frozen, while Azrael merely looked back at her with her head tilted.

\"Those are just ghosts,\" Ryouko said inelegantly, reaching for Sacnite.

She pulled the other girl into a side hug as she started sniffling.

\"Hey, come on,\" she said, wiping the other girl\'s eyes. \"You can\'t let them get to you like that.\"

\"I miss my mother,\" the girl said, rubbing her face into Ryouko\'s sleeve. \"I can\'t help it. I keep thinking about her.\"

\"It\'s okay to miss her, but we have to focus on making new memories together,\" Ryouko answered.

The girl looked up at her, tears spilling out of her eyes onto dark brown skin.

\"You mean it?\"

Ryouko opened her mouth, freezing for just a moment.

*You... didn\'t think that through,* Clarisse commented.

*No, no I didn\'t,* Ryouko thought. *It just seemed like the natural thing to say.*

\"Of course I do!\" Ryouko said, trying to sound cheerful.

*In for a penny, in for a pound,* she thought.

Sacnite nodded, and even smiled, seeming happy for a moment.

*Goddess, she\'s young,* Clarisse thought. *Mentally, I mean. Much younger than you were when I first, uh, met you.*

*It probably hasn\'t been more than four years since she left the tank, Clarisse,* Ryouko thought.

*I know; I\'m just reiterating.*

*I haven\'t heard you swear to the Goddess before,* Ryouko appended.

*Hey, it can\'t hurt.*

Ryouko looked up for a moment at the others, catching Azrael giving her a thumbs‐up. Had she...

Asami stood up, walking over to the bed and sitting down next to Sacnite.

\"Did you have any friends down at the colony?\" she asked. \"How are they doing?\"

\"They\'re mostly okay, I think,\" Sacnite said. \"I got to see some of them. They don\'t tell me much, though.\"

*I hope we didn\'t kill one of them during the mission,* Meiqing thought, grimacing.

*Thanks, I didn\'t even think of that,* Asami shot back sarcastically. And my mood was improving too.*

Ryouko smiled. Her mood was improving too, even if she had become abruptly aware that the propaganda video of her comforting Sacnite would soon be broadcast across the tiny human corner of the galaxy.

It just felt pleasant, feeling like she had made a difference with something so simple.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"We should visit her again,\" Asami said, as they stepped back out into hallways of the cruiser.

\"I agree,\" Azrael echoed.

Ryouko agreed as well, but her attention was focused instead on Meiqing, whose expression looked troubled, shoulders tense. The conversation with Sacnite had seemed to disturb her, rather than relieve her, and Ryouko was worried that it had been a bad idea.

\"You want to get some food?\" Asami asked, seemingly determined to push forward with an air of normalcy.

Meiqing felt Ryouko\'s gaze on her, turning slightly to look at the others.

Meiqing shook her head slightly, not at Asami\'s question, but at the general situation.

\"I\'m glad we came,\" she said. \"This kind of thing...\"

She turned away from the rest of them, almost talking to the wall, shoulders hunched, but voice still clear.

\"During the Unification Wars, there was an entire branch---nearly half---of my family that supported the FA. It tore us apart. Sisters and cousins killing each other, things like that. It nearly broke us. After the war, it turned out that some of us had been involved in engineering the FA Elites. The shame stains everything now, like a giant open wound, and the other families never let us forget about it. I\'m only a teenager, and I\'m already sick of hearing about it.\"

She paused.

\"It should feel like redemption to be doing all this, but seeing all this in person makes it worse somehow.\"

\"Genetic engineering can be used for good as well as evil,\" Azrael said. \"I thought we talked about this.\"

\"I know.\"

A moment later Meiqing straightened her back and walked away, making it clear she didn\'t intend to be followed.

The cloak covering Azrael\'s back jerked slightly, and Ryouko knew that Azrael was twitching her wing roots in an abortive gesture of emotion.

\"She\'ll be fine, eventually,\" Azrael said. \"It\'s hard being new to the business.\"

\"I hope,\" Asami said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kyouko squinted up at the unfamiliar light of X‐25\'s star, shining through gaping holes in the ceiling of what had been the colonists\' main religious structure. The light glinted off the main gateway into what had been the colonists\' underground cloning facility, underneath what had been an enormous altar. A few military personnel milled about and guard drones buzzed throughout the area, but the building was otherwise abandoned. It made for a substantial improvement from how it had looked only recently, scattered with debris and the shattered remnants of a giant statue, dead colonists scattered where they had died.

\"So this is the place, huh?\"

Kyouko looked up, surprised at having been addressed.

\"Oh, yeah,\" she said.

She had been lost in her thoughts---not a very Kyouko‐like thing to do, she was aware, but she had much to think about.

The girl she had brought here, a clairvoyant‐telepath named Jong Yi, peered up at the building\'s structure.

\"This would have been a nice place, before, you know, the bombing.\"

Kyouko shook her head.

\"A nice place with a black heart.\"

Jong Yi looked down at the floor for a moment.

\"I should remind you again that I\'m not actually sure that this will work,\" she said. \"My base power is intended to detect the intentions of individuals at *the current moment.* It\'s only recently that I started experimenting with stretching it into the past.\"

\"Yes, and, as such, you threw a flag in the system,\" Kyouko said. \"If you pull this off, you\'ll be officially too valuable to be on any frontline *MC* squads.\"

Jong Yi grunted, grasping a group of grief cubes and holding them next to her heart, where her soul gem was.

\"It\'s not my intention to be leaving my girls,\" she said. \"I just thought it\'d be useful for scouting.\"

She transformed, planting her ruby scepter into the ground in front of her. The two of them would have made a pretty sight in combat, Kyouko thought.

\"I heard Nakihara Asami was on the team that got sent down,\" Jong Yi said as she closed her eyes.

\"Yes.\"

\"I\'m surprised. I was glad she was sent off the lines. She wasn\'t cut out for it. I didn\'t think she\'d end up in a mission like that, of all places.\"

\"There were special circumstances. Look, I don\'t want to be mean, but I\'d rather not stand here chatting. Lives---\"

\"I know,\" Jong Yi said, interrupting. \"I can do two things at once.\"

The tip of her scepter began to glow a pale red, growing slowly in intensity, at first barely visible against the sunlight, but then beginning to cast a faint red tint on her surroundings.

\"There was a statue here,\" Jong Yi said. \"It was important. They worshipped it.\"

\"Yes,\" Kyouko said. \"Unfortunately too much of it was destroyed, and none of our drones got a good look at it.\"

She bit back an impatient \"Focus!\" command.

Jong Yi seemed about to say something, but instead shook her head, keeping her eyes closed.

A moment later a series of red lines began to appear around her, forming what almost resembled an intricate spider web, though without the carefully patterned order. Red lines showed people moving in and out of pews, up to the altar, in and out of the building.

Kyouko bit back another question, deciding to take Jong Yi at her word that, yes, she could spread this web of intention over the entire town. Far in the skies above them, drones kept watch for the anticipated red lines. If she was right, there would eventually be only one red line leading out of the town, leading far into the distance.

Until then, she could only stand and wait, and hope Jong Yi could really do it. Thus far the surveillance sweeps of the planet, both conventional and magical, had turned up little. There was a whole planet to search, and against unknown technology, only clairvoyance was reliable---but standard clairvoyance couldn\'t usually sweep a planet.

Specialists were called for, and Kyouko had searched the manifests of the task force until she found someone, anyone, who might fit the bill. Jong Yi was perfect---if she could really pull off what she said was a recent, experimental extension of her powers.

Even if Jong Yi couldn\'t cover the whole town, they could still recharge her and move her section by section in a circle around the town, until they found the red line they wanted. But that would take a long time, and Kyouko was getting increasingly impatient. She feared what might happen to those kids, and wanted to meet this DeWitt once and for all.

There was nothing effective to do but wait, the kind of situation that Kyouko had never handled well. She preferred to be always on the move, rather than to be forced to stop and think. It was a tendency that she had managed to quell over time but, fundamentally, her personality just wasn\'t suited to that kind of introspection.

*Stop thinking about it so much! Just roll with the punches, like I do!*

She could still remember herself saying that, so many years ago. It was good advice, advice she had always tried to follow, and she had done fine for herself---she liked to think that after so many years of going by gut instinct, her gut had learned to be pretty damn accurate.

But the girl she had given that advice to hadn\'t listened, not to a single word, and she had died so, so easily. Compared to old‐growth timber like her and Mami, Sayaka had been a mere sapling, crushed underfoot far too early.

Maybe that was why these missing children bothered her so much. So many saplings, with no chance to learn the ways of life, being placed in the path of a herd of voracious goats. She could recall all too clearly the many girls she had seen cut down similarly early. Not just Sayaka, but many others, some cut down by Oriko in one of her rampages, without even a chance to see what was coming for them---others disappearing into the night, without a chance for anyone else to even know what had happened.

It was never spoken aloud, but every girl had known the truth, deep in their heart. It didn\'t matter how much you strove to be smarter, faster, and stronger than the others. It didn\'t matter how unbreakable you seemed. In the end, unless you were Clarisse with her wish, you had to be *lucky.* There was nothing that made her intrinsically better than any of the rest. No reason she had lived and Sayaka had died other than time, circumstance, and place.

Where would she be now if Mami hadn\'t been there to catch her after her family died? Where would she be if Mami hadn\'t heard her family\'s name on the news just in the nick of time? Where would she be if Mami hadn\'t taken the leap of intuition, or had been just thirty minutes slower?

She would be with the Goddess, and her father would in the end have killed her just as surely as he had killed her sister.

She sighed. This was why she didn\'t like introspection. All it ever turned into was an exercise in staring into the abyss, and observing what stared back. It simply wasn\'t something you could do. Mami hadn\'t believed her about that, and look where she ended up.

And yet, she couldn\'t shake the quiet, nagging voice that reminded her that if her team hadn\'t forced her to stop and re‐evaluate, she would\'ve gotten them all killed. Nor could she understand why she couldn\'t now seem to stop herself thinking about things.

Well, there was another side to introspection. Occasionally you remembered something funny. For instance, the next line she had said to Sayaka was:

*What does it matter if your soul is in the gem? Your body still works, right? You can still fuck him, can\'t ya?*

If she recalled correctly, Sayaka had then slapped her hard enough to send her flying into the nearest wall. Magical girl strength was scary sometimes. Fortunately, Mami and Kyouko were both quite skilled in the magical repair of walls, from sad necessity.

\"What are you smiling so much about?\" Jong Yi asked, breaking Kyouko\'s reverie.

\"Just reminiscing,\" Kyouko responded automatically, before realizing that Jong Yi was no longer channeling her magic, and had walked over next to Kyouko.

Checking her mindscape, Kyouko saw that one of the drones had successfully spotted a single magical line running out of the colony, and off into the distance. Her TacComp apparently hadn\'t thought it worth interrupting her ruminations to tell her about it, which was odd.

\"Now it\'s just a matter of tracking it, right?\" Kyouko asked.

\"Yes,\" Jong Yi said. \"Following that one line will be way easier than saturating a whole town with clairvoyance. But we have to be careful---eventually that line will run into the person it represents, and I haven\'t yet figured out how to hide it. I can\'t imagine it\'s possible to miss a glowing red line appearing out of nowhere. I wouldn\'t assume anything good about it, myself.\"

Kyouko closed her eyes thoughtfully.

\"We already discussed this,\" she said. \"We\'ll have to chance it. We can scan in front of our path, but if we eventually run into the end, we might have to act fast.\"

\"I know,\" Jong Yi said, nodding thoughtfully.

The girl peered down at the floor for a moment.

\"So what specialists are we bringing?\" she asked, finally.

\"Well, this time we know we might be going into a hostage situation,\" Kyouko said. \"Or at least a situation that might call for more subtlety than blowing everything up. So teleporters, clairvoyants, telepaths. Fortunately, Task Force Rhamnusia has had to deal with these kinds of situations before, so we even have a few unusual girls to help.\"

Jong Yi scraped the toe of her shoe against the floor.

\"I won\'t ask about these previous situations,\" Jong Yi said. \"The briefing certainly had enough. But what if we run into another nuke?\"

\"We\'re prepared for that too,\" Kyouko said. \"If you\'ll remember, we have a teleporter who can get us as far as two hundred kilometers away. I\'m more concerned about the children.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*I was looking forward to a break, myself,* Azrael thought, her telepathic voice relayed through the magical girl network from the other side of the formation.

Ryouko peered out the window, her ocular implants zooming in on the distant Azrael, dressed in jumpsuit, goggles, and transparent, barely‐there wings. She didn\'t look particularly regal, but regal was not* the order of the day---they were all stealthed, in one way or another, and she could only see Azrael because she was permitted to.

The stealthed air vehicle she was riding, an Icarus Industries *S Noctowl*, was shared with Kyouko and a few of the other magical girls. Some she now felt almost intimately familiar with, such as Gracia, Nana, and Marianne, who talked in quiet voices with Kyouko. Others were entirely new, veterans from Task Force Rhamnusia specialized in the bloodless capture of civilian populations. These girls stayed oddly silent, almost brooding.

Asami was there, too, of course, in case of some more squid‐like stealth devices she might be helpful in detecting.

Azrael flying so far away from the group made Ryouko a bit nervous, as did the arrangement in general. Their squadron of stealthed transports flew in a tight, silent formation, flanked by air support platforms and numerous drones. Most of the transports carried only less valuable human specialists from Task Force Rhamnusia---the magical girl operatives rode with Ryouko, so she could evacuate them all at once in the event of unexpected nuclear detonation.

Which was why Azrael\'s positioning made her nervous. Azrael was too far away, in her opinion. Detailed simulation had suggested that the barrier generators could probably stall an explosion just long enough for her to gather everyone with a few short‐range hops, then charge for the truly long‐range teleports, but every millisecond counted, and the extra time it took her to charge a teleport to Azrael could easily be important.

It went almost without saying that in the event of disaster, the regular humans---pilots and special forces---would simply be left behind. Ryouko could not carry them all, she was the only teleporter in the Task Force with enough meaningful range, and it made sense to leave extra personnel behind in a situation where they had more than enough people and every additional ounce of remaining firepower, lethal or not, might make all the difference.

*We\'ve been over this,* Clarisse thought, sighing almost audibly. *The extra time it would take you to get to Azrael is insignificant relative to how long it would take you to charge the long‐range teleport. Either the barrier generators can hold, or they can\'t. That tiny time difference is unlikely to matter.*

*It just makes me nervous, and it\'s not just about time to escape. In the time I\'d be delayed getting to her, the radiation would tear her apart.*

*Which is* not *a lethal injury.*

*I just don\'t... want anything to be my fault, that\'s all.*

She felt a slight tug at her hair, and glanced over, finding that Asami had twisted some of their hair together playfully. The girl smiled at her, and she smiled back.

A moment later, Asami closed her eyes again, going back to scanning the area in front of them for gravitational anomalies, keeping their hair together.

She envied Asami a little. She envied the way she seemed not to think about what was waiting for them, about all the things that could go wrong, about the people that might die. She didn\'t mean that Asami didn\'t think about it at all---of course she did---but she could move on to think about other things. Ryouko, on the other hand, found that she could only focus on what she knew was important, on the details of nuclear escape and nonlethal takedown---on the minute details that could save their lives, soon enough.

It helped that Asami had an actual task to focus on, to distract her attention, while Ryouko was reduced to constantly checking her soul gem for unusual brightness.

*Those guards that died in the underground base weren\'t your fault, Clarisse thought. *There was no way anyone could have known. You\'re letting it eat at you too much.*

*I know, but that doesn\'t mean I can stop it.*

Ryouko glanced at her soul gem again, this time narrowing her eyes. The light sensors attached to it had registered a slight uptick in intensity, and looking at it, she could almost imagine...

\"Woah!\"

Everyone on board the shuttle looked up at the pilot\'s exclamation, and Ryouko stiffened, preparing for the worst.

But there was no bright flash, no panicked emergency barriers going up. Instead, an urgent notification appeared inside Ryouko\'s mindscape, unboxing itself immediately into new, directly implanted information.

\"A large base just appeared out of nowhere directly in front of us,\" Kyouko said, repeating the obvious for the sake of discussion. \"The scanners are still working on examining the layout, but it\'s nearly deserted, except for a small group of people deep within the base, mostly children. I think we found what we\'re looking for.\"

\"Did we just get inside their stealth bubble or something?\" Asami asked.

\"No. This base is showing up on the satellites now. It\'s almost really as if it just appeared out of nowhere.\"

Ryouko looked at her soul gem. The brightness she thought she had been seeing was gone.

She took a moment, just a moment, to peer outside at the ground below, which at the moment showed only the dense inscrutable canopy of some tropical jungle.

\"We have to go now,\" she said, looking up. \"I\'m in range to teleport. I\'m sure they know their stealth is down. We have to go before they do something crazy.\"

Kyouko glanced at the team clairvoyants for confirmation.

\"It definitely looks like the cult leader. He looks shocked. Surrounded by unconscious children lying on the floor. Otherwise, nothing of note.\"

Kyouko nodded.

\"Then let\'s go. The rest of the squadron will drop down whenever they can.\"

One of the other teleporters vanished immediately in a puff of smoke, the others shifting inwards towards Ryouko. As they did, she worked through the possible scenarios in her head, biting her lip. The teleportation range---about 50 km---was close enough that she could get back out relatively quickly since she wouldn\'t be expending her teleportation ability on a full‐range teleport. But unless a disaster that necessitated an emergency evac happened, there was not much else for her to do other than stay alert. It would be up to everyone else to lock down the area as much as possible.

A moment later, the teleporter reappeared, Azrael in tow, and Ryouko could begin her teleport. She closed her eyes to help herself achieve the extra bit of focus...

The spasm of magic that occurred when she reopened her eyes was blindingly fast, even by the standards of someone who had seen so many teleportation insertions that the massive barrages of light had started to seem a bit redundant.

The cornerstone of Task Force Rhamnusia\'s nonlethal capture force was Gabrielle Siegel, whose hallmark skill was an area‐of‐effect field that slowed time for everyone except those she pre‐designated. That was coupled instantaneously with a massive barrage of sticky, magically enhanced spider silk that seemed to fall from the sky, *another* set of strings from Marianne, a fusillade of mind‐control effects, a flash of light intended to blind anyone in the area, multiple barriers, and a set of Kyouko mirror images appearing on the other side of the room, purely as a distraction.

*I don\'t sense anything,* Asami thought.

*Soul gem looks normal,* Ryouko echoed.

Nana took a moment to assess the situation, then blasted the area with a bright purple shimmer of technology‐and‐magic‐disabling power. With the true finesse of a practiced user, the magic of the rest of the team was untouched.

Only then was it possible to get a clear view of their surroundings. An avalanche of glowing white threads plastered the room, covering both the walls and row after row of occupied beds. These were covered so thickly that it was only just possible to vaguely discern the shape of human forms buried underneath, though it was trivial to deduce from the size of bodies and the clairvoyants\' previous observations that these were almost certainly the missing children.

\"They\'re still alive, just unconscious,\" Gracia said, grasping Kyouko gently by the arm. An unnecessary comment, perhaps, but a familiar look had crossed the Ancient\'s face, and it hadn\'t been obvious if Kyouko remembered the clairvoyants\' pre‐battle observations.

Within Gabrielle\'s time‐slowing field, they were able to take a luxurious amount of time to scan their perimeter, searching for threats, traps, or even the slow‐motion shockwave of an incoming explosion. None of those were apparent.

\"Keep the field up, Gabrielle,\" Kyouko said. \"I believe we have an appointment with Mr. DeWitt over there.\"

At the end of one of the rows of beds was the kneeling figure of a man, probably in a position of prayer, though now trapped in almost a grotesque caricature, struggling in extreme slow motion against the white threads that bound him.

Kyouko did not wait for him to finish, stalking her way across the floor with the rest of team following warily, two designated members dropping out to check on the unconscious children.

She grabbed Grigori DeWitt by the collar, drawing the man up into the air. The white threads that bound him vanished, leaving the larger man dangling almost absurdly, kicking his legs in surprise now that he was released from the slowed time field.

Kyouko swung him back down, pulling the starched collar of his black and white reverend\'s outfit down to her face level as if he weighed absolutely nothing, dragging his legs along the floor.

\"Checkmate, Mr. DeWitt,\" she growled into his face, turning his name into an expletive. \"Let me make things real clear to you. You tell me what the hell you were thinking with this colony, and if I like what I hear, I may just let you live. No guarantees, though.\"

*I\'m reminding you, we take him alive if we can,* Marianne thought, sternly. *If there\'s going to be any killing, Governance wants to do it.*

The cult leader stopped tugging pointlessly at Kyouko\'s grip and looked up at the roof.

\"Ah, Sakura Kyouko,\" the man said, voice distant and unpanicked. \"I know about you. Poor lost soul. You have no understanding of what you could become.\"

Kyouko\'s face contorted, and her fist tightened on his collar, so expressively that Ryouko had visions of DeWitt\'s rail‐thin neck snapping like a twig.

It didn\'t, though, and the man even continued to speak, Kyouko showing admirable discipline---or simply speechless rage---by not interrupting him.

\"She showed the way, but she was lost too. I saw her---though she thought herself concealed, *I knew.* I thought I was alone, but they came to help me. It all came together as planned.\"

\"Stop trying to be clever,\" Kyouko warned. \"You know we can read your mind by force if we have to. We can make it much worse than any torture.\"

\"Oh, I know,\" DeWitt said. \"There are many things you girls can do. More than you think. Something blocks your transcendence. It was necessary to find out what it was.\"

\"Hence, the *experiments?*\" Kyouko demanded.

\"It was necessary,\" DeWitt said calmly. \"Better clones than any actual children. You think I\'m a monster, but look, I brought the children of the colony away with me, away from the fighting, away from your poisoned world.\"

He gestured grandiosely---or tried to, at the children arrayed around them.

The doors of the warehouse‐sized room burst open, some of the special forces troops that formed the remainder of their operations force showing up to help secure the hostages. True professionals, they began scattering among the children, checking them and preparing to move them out of the area, ignoring whatever it was Kyouko was doing.

\"The clones were a disappointment,\" DeWitt said. \"Only one of them ever made a contract. Before that, I wasn\'t even sure they had true souls.\"

Kyouko visibly gritted her teeth.

\"You\'re a monster,\" she said. \"Your cult was supposed to be against the use of magical girls in combat, and then you send one to lure us into a trap?\"

\"Perhaps I am a monster, but no more than you,\" he said. \"And she was only a clone.\"

Kyouko was visibly straining at the edges of her restraint, and the other girls in the area tensed, ready to try and intervene if Kyouko did anything rash.

But Kyouko did not snap.

\"Impressive,\" the cult leader said, patronizingly. \"You were supposed to kill me on the spot. Any other questions for me before you try your blasphemous mind‐reading on me, then?\"

\"No,\" Kyouko growled. \"I\'m done here. I just wanted to see your face.\"

\"And I wanted to see yours. Goodbye.\"

DeWitt\'s eyes rolled up weirdly in his head, and Kyouko\'s eyes widened in turn.

If the rest of the team had really believed they could successfully stop Kyouko from executing the cult leader, they were swiftly disabused of the notion. To Ryouko, it had seemed that one moment Kyouko was there, peering into the cult leader\'s eyes with shock, and then the next, Kyouko was mid‐follow‐through on a vicious slice with her spear, blood and gore obscuring the tip, and Grigori DeWitt\'s head already in the air, eyes open, falling towards the floor.

It should not have been possible for her to move fast enough to evade Ryouko\'s perception, but she had done so.

In the next moment, Gabrielle and one of the teleporters had grabbed Kyouko\'s arms to restrain her, too late, and the ripping sound of the air being torn open by Kyouko\'s slice finally reached Ryouko\'s ears.

\"What the *hell* are you---\" Marianne began.

*Grab his head!* Kyouko thought back. *Stabilize it! The man has suicide implants!*

After only the briefest hesitation, Marianne shot her strings out at DeWitt\'s head, the almost invisible wires probing prehensilely at the base of the detached spine.

Gabrielle jumped forward, casting her time slow field on the head, while the group healer, who also carried an emergency life support device, rushed forward.

\"It\'s too late,\" Marianne said, breathlessly. \"She was right, but it\'s already too late. His brain is goo. Melted by special implants. No wonder he was willing to chat. I wondered why he hadn\'t just killed himself first. I thought maybe he hadn\'t managed to override the antisuicide controls, or Nana was able to disable something. Shouldn\'t have underestimated him.\"

Kyouko\'s shoulders slumped, and then she pulled her arm away from the teleporter angrily.

\"For the record,\" she spat. \"Not everyone puts suicide implants directly in the brain. I figured chopping his head off was worth a try.\"

\"At least the children are alive,\" Kyouko said, looking back over her shoulder. \"Though we\'ll have to check if they\'ve been messed with. I wanted to know what was going on here. Instead, we\'re going to have sit around sifting evidence, playing back what the guy said---what a waste of time. I\'m sure everything he said was junk.\"

Asami and Ryouko had merely stood slack‐jawed, unable to react to what they were seeing. They had seen enough gore in their simulations to be inured to the decapitation, but everything that had just happened was just...

*I think this would be a good time to provide an explanation,* a cheery, almost boyish voice thought, resounding in their heads.

It was unmistakably an Incubator, who nonchalantly appeared out of the ether directly in front of Kyouko.

It took Ryouko a moment, but she realized that this wasn\'t just any Incubator---this was Kyubey, the Mitakiharan Incubator who had contracted her.

\"Well then, explain,\" Kyouko said, glaring at the Incubator with barely concealed fury. *Starting with what you\'re doing here.*

*I tagged along with you on your trip here to monitor events. It was also thought you\'d be more receptive to what I said, rather than any other Incubator.*

The Incubator glanced at the other girls on the team, almost like a human would.

*We\'ve been monitoring this illogical grouping of humans for a while now, ever since we discovered them out here. Their leader had some interesting theories about magical girls that he wished to test.*

The Incubator rubbed one of its ears with a paw, seeming almost satisfied with itself.

*The creation of new magical girls runs through us. We do not contract girls if it runs contrary to our interests. The only girl we contracted was one we knew would summon assistance here. I am glad we were able to accurately predict that Sacnite\'s wish would bring you here, though we did not predict how exactly it would happen.*

\"Why didn\'t you tell us anything earlier?\" Kyouko demanded.

*It is not our policy to intervene so directly in the affairs of humans. We allowed Sacnite to contact you, as it was her wish to do so, but otherwise---*

\"Bullshit!\" Kyouko interrupted, almost snarling the word.

She leaned forward, peering directly into the Incubator\'s eyes.

\"You\'ve intervened in our affairs plenty of times. I\'ve seen you do it! And don\'t pretend you don\'t rat people out either! If you really wanted us to show up to this colony, you would have just told us!\"

The others stood around her, eyes wide in mild shock. Most of them had never seen an Incubator rebuked in such a fashion.

The Incubator tilted its head slightly, saying nothing, and Kyouko continued:

\"This colony was here so long because you allowed it to be here, because it suited your purposes somehow.\"

*You should be grateful,* the Incubator thought, shaking its head. Regardless, I thought it might interest you to know something about what we observed here.*

The Incubator looked expressively at the room around them.

*First, this facility was not built by your cultists. That is easy enough to deduce, but we can additionally tell you that this was built by another group, who supported the cultists by providing them the weapons and resources to build their base, while they stayed here, hidden in this base. Grigori DeWitt was advised by them. Once it was clear you would find this base, they abandoned him here, with his agreement, and departed in their cloaked ship.*

Kyubey dipped his head slightly, as if nodding to itself.

*Second, it greatly interested us that they had a statue of Akemi Homura inside their main building. Grigori DeWitt believed that he had seen her earlier on Optatum, after she was supposed to have died, and based much of his insane beliefs on what she had achieved. He was quite sincere in this belief, but that is of course not surprising for someone so insane. After all, we had plenty of Incubators on Optatum at the time, and it is absurd to suggest that he could see her, when we couldn\'t.*

Kyubey looked back up at Kyouko.

\"Well?\" Kyouko asked, after a long moment of staring. \"That\'s hardly a complete explanation.\"

*We would rather not say anything else.*

Kyouko blinked, then snarled, smashing her spear into the spot where the Incubator stood---but it was no longer there. The polished gray flooring cracked open, shards of fabricated rock scattering upward from the point of impact.

*Honestly,* Kyubey thought, reappearing on Kyouko\'s shoulder. *So illogical and violent. None of you have managed to kill one of my bodies for centuries. We will forever be confused why you would prefer such waste.*

Kyouko stood back up straight, Kyubey and all, shaking her head.

\"It\'s just stress relief. Not that you understand the concept, you rat.\"

*You should be grateful,* the Incubator repeated, its body slowly disappearing. *But it was good to see you, Kyouko.*

Kyubey vanished a moment later, leaving Kyouko standing there holding her spear loosely.

\"Did it just call me by my personal name?\" she asked, peering over at Marianne.

\"Yeah,\" she said.

\"Weird,\" Kyouko said.

She tapped her foot on the floor one, two, three times, then looked around at the children around her.

\"This is pissing me off; I need a break to think.\"

She turned on her heel and strode briskly towards one of the exits. It was clear that the others weren\'t intended to follow her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kyouko\'s entire life had been shaped by religion and faith, in both a positive and a negative sense. In the long centuries that stretched between the death of her family and seeing Homura on New Athens, it had followed her always, as present in its deliberate absence as it ever was in her church.

*I know that,* she thought, as she stomped through the now secured hallways of the compound. *I don\'t lie to myself. Not like Mami. Not since the beginning.*

But was that really true? What about all the years she had spent refusing to reflect, refusing to think? All the years she had spent drinking away her life in a thousand high‐end bars, spending night after night in a different bed?

*That\'s not lying to myself, damn it!* she answered, resisting the urge to slam her fist into the wall near her. *I know what demons I\'m running from.*

In her mind, she saw the images that had tormented her her whole life.

Her father bouncing her on his knee, smiling down at her.

Her father standing in front of the altar, expression radiant, as if God himself spoke through him.

And finally, the lifeless bodies of her family, her sister lying in a pool of blood, body gashed and broken, the flames already consuming her.

A part of her had burned there with the rest of her family, she knew. That part of her ached, the hole in her heart that had almost cast her into the flames with them.

*You abandoned us,* she thought, gripping the frame of a doorway as it slid open. *You were supposed to save us. My father believed in you, and you let the demons consume us. Why?*

She looked up, and saw that the metal‐ceramic composite of the door frame had twisted and warped under her grip, the door whining unhappily at the injury. She saw that she had somehow reached one of the service entrances to the mysterious base. A small clearing just outside the doorway led directly into jungle, the sun shining down from above onto her, harsh and burning.

She remembered a wall of swords streaking out of the sky in front of her on just such a sunny day, the clawed maniac of the Southern Group recoiling from the assault, pausing in her attack on Kyouko.

She remembered the swordsman descending out of the sky a moment later, placing herself between Kure Kirika and a heavily‐injured Kyouko, the blood pouring out of her side where Kure had stabbed her.

\"*I\'m not leaving you behind! Not while I\'m still alive,*\" *Sayaka shouted, looking down on her, eyes full of fire.* \"*I heard what bucket head over there was telling you. It\'s bullshit. You don\'t deserve to die.*\"

Then Sayaka had turned towards Kirika, eyeing the other girl down the length of her sword.

*Everyone deserves to be saved, if they change themselves. Don\'t ever look back!*

\"We tried to save the world,\" she said. \"Just like you would want. I did everything you said. But you couldn\'t follow your own damn rules, and you died too.\"

*Four and a half centuries of this damn nonsense, and people are still suffering. The demons of this world still consume the hearts of men, and they in turn inflict torment on those under rule.*

She cracked a slight smile at the thought, which sounded like a line from a sermon.

It would have been so much easier to have given in, she thought. So much easier to do a little studying, put together a little effort, and empty her own memories with a quiet self‐Reformat. It would hardly be unique---the practice was common enough that the MHD even had a name for it, and kept a close watch on some of the older girls. Kyouko would be lying if she had said that she\'d never once considered it.

Kyouko shook her head, letting a tear fall, and fell to her knees.

She would try to pray.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko had felt sickened by the situation. The others had told her not to follow, but she could see that Kyouko was in distress, and had been for the whole trip to this forsaken planet.

She followed the other girl at a distance, trailing her through the abandoned halls of the compound. Kyouko was too preoccupied to notice she was being tailed, and Ryouko even had the time to observe her surroundings *en passant*. There had been something big going on here, and there were clear signs of equipment being hastily stripped from the compound.

Finally, the other girl stopped just outside an entrance into the building and Ryouko let out a breath, wondering if Kyouko was going to acknowledge---or had even noticed---her presence.

Instead, Kyouko grabbed the side of the door frame, crushing it in her hand like a disposable cup, causing Ryouko to flinch.

\"We tried to save the world,\" she heard Kyouko say. \"Just like you would want. I did everything you said. But you couldn\'t follow your own damn rules, and you died too.\"

Ryouko had no idea what she was talking about, or if Kyouko really thought she was talking to someone. According to their team interface, Kyouko\'s soul gem was only somewhat below normal, but Ryouko felt nervous.

Something nagged at her. She found herself remembering Kyouko dying on the cliff, long ago in her vision.

*But that can no longer happen, right? We prevented that future.*

She almost sighed in relief when the girl finally fell to her knees in an obvious prayer posture. She knew enough to expect that it would calm Kyouko down.

She stepped forward cautiously, hoping to avoid startling the other girl.

The clearing in front of them was beautiful, the sun streaming in through the hole that had been carved in the canopy above, the edges ragged where the jungle sought to reclaim the land that it had once owned. Ryouko wondered just how it was that they had managed to hide such a large base from sensors, when the missing trees alone should have given it away.

They had already found what had presumably been the base\'s stealth generator, completely obliterated by an explosion just before they had arrived. Whoever had built it clearly didn\'t want them to get their hands on the technology.

She peered up towards the canopy, narrowing her eyes slightly at the clouds of insects milling about in the unusual sunlight. Something about this situation bothered her.

*Impressive,* the cult leader had said to Kyouko. *You were supposed to kill me on the spot.*

There were many ways to interpret what he had said, including simply that they were the ravings of a madman. Yet something about those words was deeply unsettling. It gave her a certain sensation, a certain *déj vu,* not that this situation had happened before, but that she had felt this sensation* before.

*It feels like your vision with the submarines, and Mikuni Oriko looking up at you.*

Ryouko\'s eyes widened.

*Yes, that exactly. How did you know? Do you feel it too?*

*No. That was right after Version One of... me was installed. I wasn\'t even online yet. I\'m just telling you what memory your brain is trying to tug at.*

*I see.*

She was sure Kyouko must have noticed her by now. One probably didn\'t get to be that old without being able to sense another magical girl half a meter away, no matter how distracted you were. Kyouko was probably just really focused on praying.

*What does it mean, though?* she thought. *Why would I be reminded of that right now?*

*Well, this was the mission that submarine thing was supposed to be about, right? Well, here we are.*

She shook her head.

*I don\'t think that\'s all it is. Something about what he said... riddles in the dark.*

She narrowed her eyes, raising a hand to block out the sunlight that was saturating some of her optical sensors.

*That drone loitering there is way out of position---* Clarisse thought.

Ryouko saw only the briefest glimmer, a tiny blip in infrared, a signal that by rights shouldn\'t have even entered her awareness.

It was enough to send her diving for Kyouko though, moved by instinct, magic, quiet ideas simmering in the crevices of her mind, and, just maybe, the whispers of a Goddess planted in her memory.

She felt the searing heat of the laser engulf her, consuming her body even as she managed, barely, to plot the teleport out.

There was no time to feel fear, as darkness followed the fire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kyouko opened her eyes just in time to see the laser burn through the teleporter above as she flung her arms around Kyouko---just in time to feel the laser tear into the exposed parts of her body as well---

And then, she found herself just outside the beam, staring up at the drone firing downward.

She flung her spear into the drone, faster than thought, an angry cry managing to escape her lips only after the action, not before.

By the time the rest of the team appeared only a few seconds later, carried by the other teleporter, they found Kyouko already kneeling on the floor, paying no heed to her missing hand or the exposed burns that dripped blood from her shoulders and legs.

Instead, she clutched a star‐shaped soul gem in her remaining hand.

\"Thank you,\" she whispered.

> This is especially true given the Incubators\' involvement in the process of soul gem extraction. There is little reason to believe that the Incubators have any innate magical capability, and yet it is they who have learned to create soul gems, even if they will tell us nothing about it.

> Indeed, precisely because of the importance of the topic, the possible rewards of detailed investigation may be even greater. Preliminary studies have already shown that the spectral analysis of soul gem emissions may be an effective way of \"fingerprinting\" individual magical girls. Rare girls with identical spectra do seem to exist, but outside of special cases, it is possible we simply do not have enough measurement precision...

\"That\'s not healthy, you know.\"

Asami looked up at the newcomer, abandoning only for a moment her vigil, which consisted of quietly staring into the sealed vessel Ryouko\'s soul gem was being stored in.

She turned back towards the gem. A part of her was surprised that Sakura Kyouko, almighty member of the Mitakihara Four, had deigned to come find her. The rest of her didn\'t care. Kyouko\'s eccentric behavior had lost Ryouko her first body, which hardly seemed fair, given that Kyouko was over thirty times Ryouko\'s age and still had hers.

\"I don\'t really care what\'s healthy right now,\" Asami said. \"I\'m just doing what feels right. Besides, this beats sitting quietly in my room.\"

\"Fair enough, I suppose. And, with recent events, it might not be a bad idea to have someone watching the gem.\"

Asami sensed the other girl pulling a chair over to sit next to her, but didn\'t look up. What did it gain her to acknowledge the gesture?

She wondered for a moment what Kyouko would say to her. Would she apologize for getting Ryouko fried by a laser? Asami would have been lying to say that she wasn\'t angry at Kyouko for that, and at the others---and herself---for not following Kyouko like Ryouko did.

But she wasn\'t far enough gone to truly blame her for it. Things happened. She knew that. She just wished they wouldn\'t happen to her.

Or maybe Kyouko would try to discuss what had happened, the results of the post‐mission investigation? Despite the mostly successful outcome, the execution of the operation had been less than pristine, ranging from the cult leader\'s successful suicide in the face of multiple mind‐controllers to, of course, the incident with the laser‐firing drone. To call that merely a mystery would be a serious understatement.

At the moment, though, she couldn\'t find herself motivated to care. She was tired of the conspiracies and shadows that seemed to circle around Ryouko. What would it take to just live a normal life?

\"You know, sometimes your first love just never leaves you,\" Kyouko said, finally. \"It\'s been so long, and so much has happened, and I still remember my first. It will probably sound crazy, but she was in my head today during the mission. Sometimes I wish I could forget about her.\"

Asami turned her head slightly, looking at the other girl\'s face. This was not a story she had heard before.

\"What happened to her?\" she asked.

\"She died,\" Kyouko said. \"Back in the early days, when you weren\'t expected to last more than a few years at best. I don\'t want to make this seem like more than it is---she had someone else she was after, and I acted like a lovesick teenager, which means I never really made any moves. You know how it is. In retrospect, we might have worked out. We might not have. I wish we had a chance to find out.\"

Asami turned back towards the vessel in front of her, peering in through the reinforced window at the brilliant green glow of the gem, which looked glaring against the backdrop of blacker‐than‐black grief cubes.

\"It never goes away, then?\" she said.

\"It leaves an impression on your soul,\" Kyouko said. \"Even in eternity, I don\'t think it will go away. But, she\'s still alive, so you shouldn\'t be sulking like this.\"

\"I\'m more worried about what will happen than what *has* happened,\" Asami said. \"She\'s not safe.\"

\"None of us are safe,\" Kyouko said, unwrapping in her hands a piece of chocolate. \"I wish I knew why.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

No one really liked the Crown Room.

Sure, the Leadership Committee meeting room was *grand.* The virtual location mirrored the actual location, which occupied audaciously the top floor of one of the tallest buildings in Mitakihara. The room was surrounded by panoramic windows and a fully transparent ceiling, all of it tunable to control the amount of light that poured into the room---or to provide other views entirely, if preferred. The center of the room was dominated by an imposing mahogany meeting table, carved out of a single piece of giant wood, and flanked by the most comfortable chairs Kyouko had ever sat in, their leather sensuous on the skin.

Server‐bots stood on the side at the ready, poised to deliver whatever food and beverages the occupants desired. The usual recommendation was the downright legendary coffee, but in her time Kyouko had seen girls indulge in everything from *kumis* to prime rib---though it was obviously impolite to eat a serious meal during important discussions.

The physical Crown Room hadn\'t been used for nearly half a century, though. The logistics of arranging a physical meeting were too cumbersome, and the truth was everyone had gotten tired of it, even in its virtual form. Kyouko wished that one of the other proposals---Mami\'s tea rooms, Yuma\'s outdoorsy ideas---would win a plurality and finally get a new virtual location set, but getting the Committee to agree on anything that wasn\'t *obvious* was like herding cats.

Worse, actually. Kyouko had tried herding cats once---it wasn\'t that hard with a little bit of food.

\"Put shortly, someone is trying to kill me,\" Kyouko said, addressing the Committee members. \"And I don\'t mean merely the one drone that was trying to shoot me. This goes deeper than that.\"

A low murmur spread around the table, the assorted matriarchs and Ancients taking advantage of the end of Kyouko\'s statement to start whispering to each other. Kyouko\'s conclusion had probably crossed all of their minds at some point, but it had taken Kyouko saying it openly to let them all know that, yes, it was a conclusion that might have some merit to it, even if it seemed like pure conspiracy theory fodder.

She peered around the virtual room, letting her eye fall on those members of the Committee that were also members of her Church. Visions of the future, maneuvering to avoid said futures, Goddesses, and so forth were all strictly inadmissible within the governing layers of the MSY---unless coming from carefully verified magical sources---but that didn\'t mean the members of the Committee hadn\'t heard what they needed to know from other, less secular sources.

Kyouko sighed, letting gravity pull her back down into her chair, next to the empty seat at the head of the table, allowing it to massage her shoulders as she desired.

She cast her eye about the room, at the Matriarchs talking loudly at each other over the table, and through the ceiling at the planet of X‐25, hovering ominously above them like a sky‐dominating moon, covered with strategic markings and labels, and surrounded by a flotilla of bright red tags that indicated the ships in orbit.

According to Clarisse, it was not like the Goddess to make repeated, blatant interventions into the course of events. She preferred to be subtle, and to get the most done with the least possible modification. She was the sort of deity who preferred to kill a butterfly in Africa, then watch silently as a typhoon was diverted in Asia, to use Clarisse\'s odd phrasing. The recent pattern of events was therefore odd, perhaps even unsettling.

\"Alright everyone, calm down,\" Mami said, in a loud, clarion tone. "Let\'s speak one at a time.\"

She waved her arms up and down in the universal gesture of \"settle down\", and the room quieted, acknowledging Mami\'s de facto chairman status, as highest‐ranking attending member.

A long pause later, Odette François, the François Matriarch, renewed the discussion:

\"I wouldn\'t be terribly surprised if this were just shenanigans from Governance. We know they don\'t really like the idea of us existing that much. Sure, the individual membership is useful to them, but they\'d much rather the MSY be a branch of Governance itself. Targeted attacks on the leadership would be one way to accomplish this.\"

A series of groans sounded off around the table, beginning even before Odette had finished speaking. Her continued and vocal paranoia about Governance was by now a well‐known topic.

\"With all due respect, that\'s wildly implausible,\" Mohana Bachchan said, leaning in from farther down the table. \"The only way that could possibly work is if they eliminated almost everyone here, and surely someone would notice what\'s up. And that\'s only one of many, many problems with that theory.\"

\"It\'s also possible they\'re trying to do something to the Cult of Hope,\" Odette argued.

\"Let\'s not get sidetracked,\" Shizuki Sayaka said, sweeping her arm over the table in a dramatic gesture. \"Honestly, I\'m not even sure we should accept that someone is really trying to kill Miss Sakura here. That\'s one plausible interpretation of events, yes, but it\'s also possible the robot that fired the laser was just being opportunistic. Asserting that the entire thing was a set up to bait Miss Sakura into the area requires a whole series of rather tenuous connections. Frankly, it could just as easily be a coincidence. That\'s what the analysis AIs we\'ve set on the problem have concluded as well.\"

Kyouko cast a veiled glance at Sayaka. She should have known that *she would be the one to bring the skepticism.

\"I wouldn\'t be sure about it being a coincidence,\" Kuroi Kana said, surprising Kyouko by speaking up on her behalf. \"Whatever else is or isn\'t going on, it\'s clear that there are a lot of mysteries surrounding this rogue colony. For instance, if I may draw the discussion elsewhere for a moment, there is the matter of the alleged statue of Akemi Homura that these cultists were worshipping.\"

\"To be fair, that is only a claim made by Kyubey,\" Yuma commented, from Kyouko\'s left.

\"Well, the Incubators have never told us anything manifestly false before,\" Kana said. \"They can be misleading, of course, but I think in this case we can accept that there was in fact a statue of Akemi Homura present, and that the cult leader truly believed he saw her on Optatum. Their choice of deity aside, I have to say I don\'t find that last belief terribly implausible.\"

A shocked murmur passed down the table, and the \"Founder\'s End\" of the table turned to glare at Kana, as subtly as they could. While it was a widespread belief that Homura was not truly dead, it was *not widespread knowledge that Internal Security had already confirmed that she had lived past New Athens, nor that signs of her had been confirmed retrospectively on Optatum. The Incubators\' assertions implied that the cult leader believed she had been there after their last evidence of her, and after presumably the last time the Incubators had seen her.

If the cult leader\'s assertion were true, it would provide another confusing and troubling timepoint to Homura\'s post‐New Athens journey.

\"Explain,\" Mami said, a little coldly, almost daring Kana to explain herself fully.

Kana smiled slightly.

\"What I meant was: I can easily believe that Homura was there on Optatum, just as easily I can believe she was---or *is*---anywhere else. What\'s important here is that she wasn\'t involved in anything that happened on this planet, other than as a figurehead for a crazy cult.\"

\"That seems to summarize it, yes,\" Mami said.

\"Back to the previous topic,\" Clarisse van Rossum said. \"It seems to me that what is worrisome is not any one of these issues in particular, but all that is happening now taken together, in gestalt. We have rogue drones attacking our leaders, respected magical girls dying without cause, a rogue colony with impossible technology experimenting on magical girls, and transports being attacked deep behind the lines when traveling randomized trajectories. Things that should not be happening are,* and that is not all that is going on, is there?\"

She peered in the direction of Mami and Kyouko, both of whom were aware what had to come next on the meeting agenda.

\"No, that is not,\" Mami said, as calmly as she could, standing up out of her chair.

The room quieted, Mami\'s standing figure seeming to suck in the gazes of everyone in the room. Even the head of the table, Kyouko and Yuma and Clarisse, turned to watch her, waiting for her to say what they already knew. For a moment Kyouko thought Mami looked like the loneliest person in the world.

\"The results of the last grief cube audit have been received,\" she said, finally. \"And the results have been, to put it mildly, disturbing.\"

Mami spoke with an iron dignity that Kyouko didn\'t think she could ever have managed in the face of the oncoming storm. She admired Mami for her ability to lock it all out, to be the rock upon which the MSY without Homura rested, never angry, never less than a leader. She admired her for it, even when she knew the flaws that Mami tried so desperately to hide.

\"There have been a number of significant discrepancies between the number of grief cubes supposedly delivered to certain frontline combat units, and the number of grief cubes reported used by the units involved, at least when anecdotal interviews are conducted. While the official post‐combat reports of these units show no discrepancy, the members of these units indicate puzzlement and bewilderment at the number of grief cubes they were supposed to have received and used---they report using far less, and this has been confirmed by review of memories stored in their TacComps. The difference in numbers has grown too great to be explained by loss in the chaos of combat.\"

A wave of shock traveled down the table, but Mami held up her hand magisterially, somehow managing to pause the tide of outrage for just a moment.

\"If you please, allow me to explain in full detail.\"

She paused for a moment, then continued, beginning to pace.

\"There is more. As part of the standard interview process, conducted by both official investigators and Church of Hope volunteers, we have received additional anecdotal reports of girls suffering total or near‐total bodyloss who should be able to revive, but who never return. Tracking the cases invariably reveals soul gems that failed inexplicably in transit to their stored clones. One prominent example is the case of Misa Virani, whose exploits near the wormhole generator you know well. Her soul gem survived the mission, yet inexplicably failed on board my own flagship, a fact that we have kept concealed up until now.\"

\"Those of us who knew had kept silent about this, aware of the potential implications, in the hopes that a continued investigation would reveal innocuous causes. As such, we directed our energy into understanding the causes of these anomalies, utilizing all the resources at our disposal. The officers of Grief Cube Supply and Logistics immediately fanned out to audit the system, we enlisted the aid of the Church of Hope, and I personally consulted with military records on the matter. Unfortunately, as you will see from these files, the mystery only got deeper.\"

Mami stopped her pacing, taking a moment to allow the rest of the Committee to browse over the documentation she had provided. She leaned over to plant her hands onto the table, peering over the rest of the table with an intense gaze.

\"There\'s no way to put a pretty face on it,\" Mami said, \"but we kept it secret in the hopes that the problem could be disposed of quietly, without anyone having to know about it. We\'ve all been around the block a couple of times---I\'m sure you all understand that things would be much cleaner that way.\"

\"Of course you would say that,\" a girl far down the table said, slamming her palm down and standing up. \"This is yet another example of you Ancients running the organization like your own damn fiefdom.\"

Kyouko put one hand to her forehead as the room erupted immediately into a cacophony of protests and shouting.

Snippets of what was being said passed through her mind:

\"You wouldn\'t even be here if some of the idiots in here hadn\'t wanted \'fresh blood\'! I swear---\"

\"You don\'t have the right to talk to Mami‐san like that---\"

\"You mean the one who doesn\'t ever even show up?\"

\"---these secrets the senior members are holding back from the organization. And about grief cubes, no less! The people who do the farming have the right to know---\"

\"Oh, please! Like you\'ve killed any demons recently---\"

\"Does Mami‐san actually believe the records the military gave her? What they told her? They\'re leading her around by the nose, and I can\'t believe she\'s falling---\"

At the senior end of the table, Kyouko watched Mami stand impassively, but bemused, as if remembering just why she and Kyouko attended the Committee meetings so infrequently. Mila Brankovic, the girl who had started this cacophony, was a rising star on the MSY political scene, at least insomuch as it was possible to crack the ranks of the Leadership Committee with its rotating body of Ancients. Some said she was a fiery idealist, dead set on deossifying the MSY. Kyouko conceded she might have been biased, but from her perspective it seemed more like Mila was exceptionally skilled at getting everyone at each other\'s throats.

Which was a useful political trait in its own right, Kyouko well knew, surveying Mila from a distance, watching her shout into the fracas, forehead impressively matted with virtual sweat.

An *extremely* loud screeching noise, akin to fingernails scraping across a chalkboard, startled Kyouko into looking up, and similarly froze everyone else in the room.

\"Enough of this!\" Clarisse van Rossum said, as the startlingly deep lines she had gouged into the wood of the virtual table disappeared.

Now standing, she peered over the table.

\"We have spent too long discussing problems, and no time at all discussing solutions. What exactly is it the Committee wishes to do, other than what is already being done?\"

She glanced around, and when no one immediately responded, continued:

\"Well, *I* have some suggestions, though I can\'t promise they\'re good. First, regarding the more pressing grief cube issue, I propose we form a new subcommittee specifically devoted to the topic. That would be a lot more transparent than having a few Ancients at the top trying to deal with the issue, which is the only real alternative. I know what everyone thinks about having more committees, but we\'ve had it work in the past, and frankly a committee with a broad range of membership would be the only way everyone would stay in the loop.\"

A murmur passed through the Committee as they considered the idea, and Clarisse gestured broadly at the assembled leaders.

\"Of course, none of this precludes doing things on your own, as long as you\'re careful not to breach secrecy too much. In fact, for something like this, I suspect the input of the various Matriarchies might even be appreciated, since they have resources MSY proper doesn\'t have access to, in the same way as the Church of Hope.\"

Kyouko felt herself looking at Clarisse in---confusion? Puzzlement? She wasn\'t sure, but instead of finding herself respecting Clarisse\'s temerity and diplomatic savvy, she found herself---

She found herself realizing that this was the role that Mami normally played, and that instead Mami was simply standing near the head of the table, facial expression strained.

*She can\'t take the bullshit anymore,* Kyouko thought. *That must be it. It happens.*

\"In addition, regarding the topic of the possible attempt to assassinate Miss Sakura, I\'m not sure we have enough evidence yet to devote tremendous resources solely to that,\" Clarisse said. \"However, perhaps we could form a special committee for everything that happened on this rogue colony. Certainly it is a matter worth discussing, since it has been a long, long time since we have seen crimes of this scale pertaining to us in particular. Especially involving an organization Kyubey tells us is still out there somewhere.\"

She looked over the table again, as both her ideas appeared next to her, written as two bullet points hovering in the air above the table.

\"Finally, I think it is long past time that we assigned special protection to the senior members of the MSY. I understand that we are generally difficult to kill, but no state has ever allowed its leaders to travel without protection, not counting Governance. We should at least do this for the duration.\"

\"You mean bodyguards,\" Kuroi Kana said, eyeing Clarisse carefully.

\"Yes, I mean bodyguards,\" Clarisse said.

\"This has been proposed before,\" Kana said. \"But that was during the War, when it was necessary, and it was abolished when the danger passed. None of us like the idea of being surrounded by *security.* This is surely not a crisis worthy of the same precautions as a global war.\"

Kana clasped her hands on the table.

\"I like your other ideas, but this seems like an overreaction. Many of us even have other, private sources of security. If it is felt that Miss Sakura in particular needs additional security, then the Kuroi clan, for one, will be happy to provide.\"

\"As would we,\" Shizuki Sayaka interjected.

\"Which is precisely the problem,\" Clarisse said. \"I doubt any of us who don\'t have our own independent security teams would really be okay with accepting security from those who do. It raises questions of independence and motivation. A professional protection service, rooted in the Soul Guard, would eliminate those questions.\"

\"With all due respect, Clarisse, I don\'t think that\'s necessary yet,\" Kyouko said, without getting up from her chair. \"I don\'t want it said that we started giving everyone bodyguards just because someone tried to kill me once. It\'s not like they even got that good a shot off.\"

\"You lost a hand. I\'d say that\'s a pretty good shot,\" Clarisse said.

\"Only because I lost my cool,\" Kyouko said, the hand in question twitching slightly as she wished for some food to hold. \"It\'s not going to happen again.\"

\"Didn\'t we agree this is all a pretty Rube Goldbergian idea anyway?\" Mohana asked. \"The idea that someone would set up a colony just to bait Miss Sakura into losing her cool and either killing an important prisoner or getting shot? It still all seems a bit much to me.\"

\"Well, it\'s more that whoever orchestrated this whole thing saw the opportunity to get me involved and took it. I don\'t think the colony was *solely* for me. That\'d be crazy.\"

Kyouko frowned slightly, remembering she could just summon food into the simulation on a whim. A moment later, a bowl of rum raisin ice cream appeared in front of her.

The matriarch Mohana shook her head.

\"Still far‐fetched. If the Black Heart were to suggest a plan like that, it would never pass the plausibility test.\"

\"I agree, it\'s not terribly plausible,\" Mami said, surprising Kyouko, who thought she had tuned out of the discussion entirely. \"I just think it\'s a possibility to keep in mind. I have a feeling about it.\"

A moment of silence prevailed over the table.

\"If that\'s the case, perhaps we should submit the question to the Far Seers,\" Kana said. \"They may be able to glean something of value.\"

Kyouko heard Mami groan. Mami had never been fond of the MSY guild of clairvoyants, who had chosen a truly mystical name for themselves. They claimed that their more unusual members could glean facts obscured to everyone else, and tried to increase their prestige by quietly encouraging prominent magical girls to submit questions.

True to form, Mami almost immediately said:

\"I\'ve never really found them all that useful. For some reason, they\'re always misleading.\"

\"But they\'re always right in the end,\" Yuma commented.

\"Like a true Oracle,\" Mami said dryly. \"Unfortunately, the true Oracle was never actually *useful.*\"

\"It can\'t possibly hurt, Mami,\" Kyouko said, around a mouthful of ice cream. \"It\'s not a bad suggestion.\"

Mami sighed, shrugging, and putting a hand to her head.

\"Alright, fine. We\'ll see what they have to say. In the meantime, unless there\'s any objections, I\'ll second Clarisse\'s three proposals so we can put them up for a vote.\"

Mami glanced around the table, where it seemed like everyone had acquiesced. Kyouko wasn\'t surprised: subcommittees were easy to propose because they didn\'t resolve any of the actual conflicts, but still seemed like a step towards a solution. The real fireworks would wait until members were appointed to the committees.

\"All in favor of proposal one?\"

A clear chorus of ayes made it obvious that proposal one, to form a subcommittee for investigating the matter of the missing grief cubes and magical girls, passed easily. Proposal two, for the formation of a similar committee to investigate occurrences on the colony X‐25 and the ghostly organization the Incubators suggested had backed them, also passed easily.

Proposal three, though, for the establishment of a protective service for senior MSY officers, clearly failed, and Kyouko saw Clarisse shrug her shoulders. It wasn\'t that important.

Kyouko watched Mami sigh slightly, knowing what was to come.

\"Alright, I think in the interests of speed, we should now decide who to appoint...\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What seemed like an interminable time later, Kyouko opened her eyes, blinking as the lights in her cabin grew softly brighter. It felt odd, not having someone by her side, but since she ended her last relationship she simply hadn\'t felt the impetus to go prowling for someone to share her bed with.

It simply made for a more pleasant experience, being able to exit a long and tiresome simulation with the knowledge that you would immediately have someone next to you that you could snog.

Kyouko sighed, postponing separate requests from Kuroi Kana and Shizuki Sayaka for a post‐meeting meeting. Whatever the topic, it could wait, and she simply wasn\'t all that interested in being followed around by a Matriarchal security detail. That \"security\" usually comprised a combination of bubbly house scions on their first assignment and plain‐clothed agents trying to blend in with the surroundings, painfully obvious to anyone of Kyouko\'s age and powers. She really wasn\'t sure what the point was, given that she could probably have taken them all on single‐handedly, but she supposed it made some people feel more secure. All the veteran girls of any real value were off doing something more important, of course.

Anyway, it wouldn\'t even have been that hard to find someone to serve as company. The local networks in any sizably populated area were always jammed full of people \"seeking bed partners\", and Kyouko had enough of a reputation that some girls would jump at her. Hell, if she really wanted, she could have accepted one of the matriarchs\' offers of security, then immediately tried to seduce her security detail. It\'s what she would have done just a year or so ago.

She looked down at her hands. As a rule, she tried to take things on an even keel, refusing to allow herself to be shaken by events, but she couldn\'t deny that the past month or so had taken its toll on her. Much of what had gone wrong on X‐25 had been undeniably her fault, or at least her responsibility. She was the one who had gotten hot‐headed at all the wrong times, and the one who had let her past get to her at the critical moment. She had lost Shizuki Ryouko her body, and even though that would have happened eventually anyway, she still felt guilty.

She was still avoiding the real issue. She sensed that her year‐long relationship with Maki had changed her, in a way none of her previous flings had. She had told herself---and Maki---otherwise, but a part of her had started to dream of something different.

She shook her head at herself. She could only imagine how much Yuma would laugh at her. For it to turn out that she had just needed to hold the door open a little...

As if on cue, her train of thought was interrupted by someone at the door. She looked up, wondering for a moment who would come to her room unscheduled, before simply checking the summons and seeing that it was, of all people, Atsuko Arisu, therapist to the stars.

She sighed, and signaled the door to open, getting up to head for the sitting room of her cabin.

She found the woman---and it was woman, not girl---perched on the edge of her couch, part of the generic couch and coffee table set that graced the sitting rooms of every shipboard cabin. On ships larger than frigates, the ratio between the available space and the human crew complement was high enough that even the lowliest technician warranted their own private cabin with the basics, though you had to be important to get anything more than that. Of course, the more permanent denizens personalized their cabins to their hearts\' content.

Kyouko didn\'t really mind the sparseness. To be honest she rather preferred the simple furniture to the ubiquitous self‐assembling smartblocks of Earth.

\"So what brings you here?\" Kyouko asked, sitting down next to Arisu. "I wasn\'t even aware you were on this ship.\"

The ship in question was the cruiser *HSS Sun Zhong Shan,* one of the ships returning to heavily settled space from the X‐25 system now that they were no longer needed.

\"I just got here,\" Arisu said. \"Docked an hour ago. I\'ve been doing the rounds, checking up on my *favorite* patients. Last stop was Mami‐san, though she\'s never excited to see me.\"

\"I\'m not really excited to see you either,\" Kyouko deadpanned, half a joke, half brutal honesty.

\"I know. None of you old ones are. Personally, I think it\'s because I remind you of unpleasant truths.\"

Kyouko looked at the woman apprehensively, trying to turn it into a glare but not really succeeding.

\"I heard about what happened at the rogue colony, of course,\" Arisu said, raising a cup of coffee to her lips. She hadn\'t asked Kyouko, of course; she had simply helped herself to the synthesizer on the way in, which was a habit Kyouko had difficulty criticizing, since she had done it herself on a number of occasions.

\"Do you want to talk about it?\" Arisu asked, tilting her head slightly.

\"Not really,\" Kyouko said.

Arisu set the coffee back into its dish with a clatter.

\"We\'re all entitled to our neuroses,\" she said, looking at Kyouko. "There isn\'t really anything negative to say about your childhood trauma giving you a bit of a reaction to cults and cult paraphernalia.\"

\"Personally I tend to think neuroses keep us interesting, going into our old age,\" Kyouko said, just to be contrary. \"Not all of us can be like Clarisse.\"

\"Clarisse isn\'t exactly neurosis‐free either, you know,\" Arisu pointed out.

\"Don\'t tell me; it will ruin my image of her,\" Kyouko said, aware that this kind of playful banter was out of character for her.

Arisu raised an eyebrow, but didn\'t comment directly.

\"Physician‐patient confidentiality. Anyway, in my profession we\'re usually inclined to let this kind of thing, or even worse, slide as long as it doesn\'t hurt anyone,\" Arisu said.

\"Like that girl who talks to buildings,\" Kyouko said, smiling thinly as she interrupted deliberately, refusing to let Arisu build up conversational momentum.

\"Precisely.\"

\"I\'m not actually sure she\'s really crazy.\"

\"The point is it doesn\'t matter.\"

Kyouko shook her head, not at Arisu\'s last sentence specifically, but at the topic as a whole.

\"Look, I admit my issues played a role in what happened on X‐25. What can I say? It\'s not like this is going to start a new trend of \'Kyouko going crazy\'\"---she made air quotes with her hands---\"every week. The circumstances were unique.\"

\"I hope so,\" Arisu said, shaking her head a little. \"I\'m not asking you to suddenly be okay with what happened to you as a child. That would be completely unreasonable, as I said. I\'m just asking you to be a little more aware of when your own judgment might be impaired and just step aside, or talk to someone.\"

\"Are you saying I shouldn\'t have gone on the mission?\"

\"No, that was reasonable. I\'m saying you should maybe have ceded leadership once it became clear what was going on. There was certainly enough veteran leadership on that team besides you. That much self‐awareness is a lot to ask, but I think it\'s not unreasonable for someone of your age.\"

\"I let them overrule me when they all disagreed with me,\" Kyouko said. "I think I did the right thing there.\"

\"And you wandering off on your own at the end of the mission? That was clearly a bad idea, and you did it anyway.\"

\"No one stopped me. Look, I don\'t want to say I\'m not at fault, but if I was suffering a failure of judgment, it was someone else\'s job to stop me. The definition of failure of judgment is that *I won\'t realize I\'m failing.*\"

Kyouko stopped leaning forward, realizing that over the course of their rapid back‐and‐forth she had leaned close enough to Arisu that they were literally breathing on each other\'s faces.

She took a breath, then stood up.

\"Look, do you mind if I get myself some food?\" she asked. \"It keeps me calm.\"

Arisu shrugged.

\"Your tics are your own.\"

There was a moment of silence as Kyouko stepped over to the edge of the room where a small dining table nestled in an alcove, with a synthesizer set into the wall.

\"You know, I\'m not here to give you a hard time about what happened on X‐25,\" Atsuko said to her back as she decided what she wanted. \"I just brought that up because it was clearly topical.\"

Kyouko waited to see if Atsuko would continue, but the woman didn\'t.

Kyouko sighed quietly. That meant Atsuko wanted Kyouko to be sitting and facing her for the conversation, which was never a good sign.

The door in the back of the synthesizer slid open, and a plate of nachos slid forward from the mysterious guts of the machine. There were perks to living in the future---a young Kyouko would have killed to get her hands on that kind of technology, and Kyouko distinctly remembered spending the days after getting her first in‐home synthesizer alternating between eating mounds of food and sleeping off the consequent food coma.

\"You know, if there\'s one thing I\'m impressed by about synthesizers, it\'s the tomatoes,\" she said, setting the plate down on the table in front of Arisu. \"I never really noticed when I was young, but unless you bought the artisanal stuff, they were really shoving some shitty tomatoes at you. Now my nachos always come with great tomatoes.\"

\"Uh‐huh,\" Arisu said, clearly not impressed by the comment.

Well, she was too young to really understand.

Kyouko sat, biting into a chip, savoring the melted combination of blue cheese, bacon, scallion, and diced tomatoes. Not exactly straightforward nachos, but she had learned to live a little in her long life.

\"I want to talk about Kishida Maki,\" Arisu said finally.

Kyouko cringed. She had known this would come up.

\"Your pattern of behavior has changed recently,\" Arisu said. \"After your previous relationships ended, you were always right back on the dating and casual sex scene. Not this time. This time, I come here to find you sitting quietly alone in your cabin. That\'s not like you.\"

Kyouko wanted to counter that she had, in fact, been in a critical top secret meeting, but the first rule of top secret meetings was that you didn\'t talk about top secret meetings, so instead she shrugged and said:

\"I\'m not even going to ask how your nosy spies know any of that. I just need a break, you know? Seems normal enough.\"

\"Not for you. I haven\'t seen you \'take a break\' in centuries. Major changes in behaviors are usually considered a flag.\"

She continued to focus on her chips, saying:

\"What are you getting at? You think I might be suicidal?\"

\"Don\'t be coy,\" Arisu said into her ear, like a guilty conscience. "You know the MHD is the best psychology service in the world, and that\'s *without* the mind‐reading. And I\'m good at my job.\"

A pause.

\"You\'ve always been afraid of entering a serious relationship, or allowing yourself the risk of being hurt emotionally, so you refused to ever treat any of these relationships seriously. You allowed yourself to indulge with Maki---and don\'t think I don\'t know what she looks like---and then she tried to leave and join a combat mission. You couldn\'t bear the chance she might get hurt, so you tried to end it there. That\'s why you broke up, and that\'s why you\'ve refused to visit her.\"

\"But you spent too long with her, long enough that you now feel something for Kishida Maki, something you haven\'t felt in a long time. That\'s the other reason you\'re doing it, but it\'s too late, isn\'t it? Is your behavior really proper for someone of your age, sleeping with someone of hers? At fifty, at a hundred, it is acceptable to toy with the hearts of others, because you don\'t know better. Not at your age.\"

\"It gnaws at you, and you know that by doing what you\'re doing you\'re just inflicting your broken heart upon her. Should she really suffer for your pain?\"

Kyouko snarled, raising a hand to strike the other girl, before managing to suppress the instinct, dragging arm back down with sheer willpower. Arisu was too experienced to be fazed.

\"I didn\'t know therapists were in the business of enraging clients,\" Kyouko growled.

\"Everything I said is true, even if you can\'t accept it yet,\" Arisu said. \"Most people outgrow their first love, but you never did. This is your neurosis, but with the leadership role you have, you *can\'t have it anymore.* We\'ve learned from what happened to Akemi‐san. We have to close the books on these kinds of things while we can.\"

\"Eternal life gave you the ticket to be eternally young, to live your life in the memory of those long gone. Your mother and your sister and Miki Sayaka---\"

\"Get out,\" Kyouko growled.

\"They would want you to move on,\" Arisu said, ignoring her. \"In your heart of hearts, you know this. Go visit Kishida‐san. You\'ve broken her heart, and you know it.\"

Kyouko closed her eyes, grinding her teeth painfully.

She clasped and unclasped her hands, staring at the other girl, then shook her head and gestured for the other girl to leave.

\"Good talk,\" Kyouko said finally, meeting the therapist\'s eyes.

She wasn\'t sure if she was being ironic or not.

\"It\'s my job,\" Arisu said. \"I hope you think about what I said.\"

Then the woman turned on her heel and strode out the door, almost making it a march.

Kyouko watched the door slide closed behind her, and sighed.

She had Church business to conduct, but maybe she would just lie in bed in a pool of self‐pity instead. That sounded like the right thing to do.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nakihara Asami held the soul gem in her hand, studying its light for a long moment. On one level, there seemed to be nothing particularly special about the pale green glow, its radiance suppressed to save energy. The cage of the gem was gold, but the gem itself might have been mistakable for an unusually large emerald, were it not for the obvious self‐luminescence.

Looking into the gem itself, she could see...

She squinted. Ryouko\'s soul gem looked...

*Like the Goddess\'s eyes.*

The revelation struck her subtly, the thought slipping through her mind like water, so that it took her a moment to even process that she had experienced a revelation.

How did she know what the Goddess\'s eyes looked like? She had never seen the deity\'s face in her vision. Only suggestions, hints, impressions that resonated on a level deeper than vision.

There were infinite worlds embedded in the Goddess\'s eyes, which were like multifaceted gems with so many facets that... that...

She didn\'t know how to describe it beyond that, only that she could see something similar in Ryouko\'s soul gem. Was this what souls looked like?

The natural thing to do would have been to summon her own soul gem and compare, but somehow she didn\'t want to learn what her own soul looked like. Indeed, she was starting to feel like she had invaded Ryouko\'s privacy by staring into hers like that.

She set Ryouko\'s soul gem on the nightstand next to her bed, the bed she and Ryouko had bought for this apartment when they first moved to Eurydome. Asami had chosen it carefully, since she had expected---hoped---that they would sleep on it for a long time. Now it just felt empty.

Ryouko\'s CubeBot, which had made the trip back to Eurydome with Asami, stirred to life, stepping off of Asami\'s own drone to scurry over to the soul gem. It scanned the gem one last time with its front eye, then began removing grief cubes from the container on its back with a single robotic arm, while Asami\'s CubeBot turned its eye to watch curiously.

Asami smiled at the drones, reflecting that whoever the CubeBot designers had been, they had known their jobs. The drones were designed to be quietly adorable, turning routine grief cube use sessions into something that could cheer up the teenage girls that owned them.

It had surprised Asami that she would be entrusted with Ryouko\'s soul gem, which she had expected to travel to its final destination automatically. Ryouko\'s clone was going to be revived on Earth, with its more advanced facilities, rather than Eurydome, as would be more typical. Something about unusual genetics.

It had been Sakura Kyouko herself who had handed the gem to her, telling her that, at the moment, there could be no safer place for it than with Asami.

She tried not to dwell on the sense of foreboding that had accompanied that conversation, waiting a moment for the CubeBot to finish its job, before picking the gem back up and converting it into a ring, one she wore on the same finger she kept her own ring---naturally, the ring finger. It felt pleasingly symbolic to her.

\"It surprises me that you came back here,\" Kuroi Nakase said, appearing in the doorway of their room. \"I thought for sure that you would go straight to Earth to wait for the revival.\"

Asami looked up.

\"I would get there too early,\" she said. \"In which case I might as well stop here first. It feels like home now.\"

Nakase turned her head slightly, and Asami could feel the implicit question in the woman\'s eyes.

*Home? What about your parents, your home?*

But Nakase did not ask.

\"And there were some other people who wanted to come with me, so it seemed natural enough,\" Asami added.

\"So I\'ve heard,\" Nakase said. \"It looks like we might have a few people staying here for the duration.\"

Asami peered at the other woman\'s expression, framed by the sunlight that shone through the hall windows, trying to read what the other woman was thinking.

\"I\'m surprised you didn\'t yell at me when I got back,\" Asami said. "You know, given the contents of our last conversation.\"

\"Our last argument, you mean,\" Nakase corrected. \"I got over it. None of this is your fault. If I\'m going to get mad at anyone, it should be my sister.\"

\"Speaking of which...\"

\"Yes, she\'ll be here soon.\"

Ryouko\'s mother turned away from her, facing the hall window for a moment.

\"You know, it\'s really odd that they didn\'t move her clone to Eurydome after you two moved here. Even for unusual genetics, there\'s nothing that could be done on Earth that they couldn\'t do here. I had honestly expected that I could oversee the revival here, but I guess not.\"

Nakase paused for a moment.

\"I sent a message to her father about it, and he doesn\'t understand it either. Apparently she just wasn\'t moved, even though he thought she would be. Well, he\'ll be helping to oversee the revival, then, so she\'ll be in good hands. No reason for me to rush back.\"

The woman turned her head towards the front door, tilting her head slightly.

\"That\'ll be my sister,\" she said, disappearing from the door of the room. None of the usual mechanisms had warned Asami of anyone approaching the door, as they should have, but Asami knew not to question the mysterious ways of Ryouko\'s aunt. It was... just the way Ryouko\'s family was, just as Asami\'s was the way it was.

She stood up a moment later, waving aside her CubeBot, who had walked to the edge of the nightstand, presenting her a grief cube with two mechanical arms, eye upturned appealingly.

\"Sorry, I\'ll do it later,\" she said, following Nakase to the door.

She nodded at Meiqing on the way out, and the girl nodded, looking a little awkward, perhaps bored, sitting on the couch of their sitting room. Meiqing had been given leave to travel back with them to attend Ryouko\'s revival, partly as a bit of a reward for her performance in the X‐25 mission, and partly because she was Ryouko\'s friend, and therefore probably a good idea to have around, for psychiatric reasons.

Nakase got to the front door before she did, meeting Nana and Sacnite as they arrived. Asami was abruptly confronted by the disparity between Nana and Nakase, one a girl her age, the other a woman much older. The family resemblance was there, but it was clear whose daughter Ryouko was. Indeed, it occurred to her that even though Ryouko and Nana definitely resembled each other, the resemblance had never been very striking. She had hardly even considered the matter.

For a moment, everyone else in the room became mere bystanders as the two sisters stared at each other, focusing their emotional energy and thoughts on each other to the exclusion of their surroundings.

\"I\'m sorry,\" Nana said, opening the conversation.

\"Sorry for what?\" Nakase demanded.

\"Sorry I let that happen to her,\" Nana said, watching Nakase carefully. \"I should have gone with her. I shouldn\'t have let her follow Kyouko‐san alone.\"

\"That\'s not what you should be sorry for,\" Nakase said, directing an intense glare at her sister. \"You should be sorry you lured her onto this mission in the first place. Everything would have been fine if you had just left well enough alone.\"

\"I refuse to apologize for that,\" Nana said, looking back at Nakase levelly. \"It was her right, and my right, to make these choices.\"

\"What right have you to expose her to these risks at *her* age? She\'s barely begun to live her life, and here she is getting torn apart by lasers.\"

\"I remember another girl the same age volunteering for those risks so her sister wouldn\'t have to,\" Nana growled.

Nakase reared backward, like a cobra dodging a strike.

\"And you think that gives you the right to make these decisions for my daughter?\"

\"Please, both of you, calm down,\" Meiqing said, appearing at their side. \"You can have this conversation later, but you\'re frightening Sacnite.\"

Asami blinked, as startled by Meiqing\'s intervention as Nakase and Nana were. She glanced at Sacnite, who had indeed started to hide herself behind Nana like a child. Somehow the decision had been reached that Sacnite would travel with them for now, for reasons they hadn\'t deigned to explain to her.

It had been easier than expected to dodge media attention towards Sacnite---it was trivial for Governance to give Sacnite a false identity in the nomenclator systems, and the expectation was strong that Governance would keep Sacnite in a military facility. Apparently not a single reporter had considered the possibility that she would be traveling anonymously with apparent civilians, even civilians who had already appeared in a propaganda video with the girl. Hiding in plain sight, as it were.

Nakase turned her attention towards Sacnite, assessing the girl with a long look.

*Whatever it is they did to her to get her to believe in her false life,* Asami remembered Nana saying on the trip over, *they didn\'t do a very good job of it. She won\'t lose the memories entirely, but they fade faster every hour---soon, they won\'t seem like real memories at all, but a movie that happened to someone else. What will she have left? A few years of life in an underground bunker, worshipping an evil man. A child with the body of a teenager, the exact opposite of the rest of us.*

Asami peered at Sacnite, and could see in her nervous expression that Nana had been right.

Nakase bent down slightly to pat Sacnite on the head, smiling pleasantly. Nakase and Nana looked at each other, sharing a look that Asami couldn\'t decipher.

\"Well, come in,\" Nakase said. \"It\'s going to be difficult to come up with bed slots for all these extra girls, but I\'m sure we can manage.\"

Asami glanced over at Meiqing to see if she had any thoughts.

Meiqing response was merely to shrug.

Then, as a group, they all turned their attention back towards the front door.

\"Someone else?\" Nakase said. \"I wonder who it could be.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Yes, I understand that you are displeased with what has taken place, Shizuki‐san,*\" Kyouko thought over the audio line, \"*but there was no way for anyone to anticipate what would happen.*\"

Even after all these centuries, Kyouko still had difficulty saying Shizuki Sayaka\'s personal name. She always wondered if the Matriarch had noticed.

\"*A mentor is supposed to make sure her trainees don\'t die,* at a minimum. *Obviously, that\'s not always possible, but I would think someone of your age could keep her from getting killed by a malfunctioning gravity generator, or by a silly drone.*\"

\"*And she didn\'t,*\" Kyouko pointed out.

\"*We can\'t keep relying on you or someone else in her immediate vicinity to keep saving her from these incidents, Kyouko‐san,*\" Shizuki said, in that voice that always annoyed Kyouko irrationally. \"*There is reason to think that whoever has been trying to kill you is also trying to kill her, and not taking precautions about such a valuable member of the family would go against our interests.*\"

Kyouko sighed.

\"*I know, but a protection team? That just seems a little too much,*\" she said.

\"*They can be discreet,*\" Shizuki Sayaka said. \"*I won\'t insult Ryouko‐chan\'s intelligence by suggesting that they can operate without her noticing, but they can definitely stay out of the way.*\"

Kyouko put a finger to her cheek thoughtfully. If she played her cards right...

\"*I wonder, do you think they could cooperate well with a Kuroi security team?*\" she asked.

\"*Definitely not---wait, is Kana trying to assign a team too?*\"

\"*Well, yes,*\" Kyouko said pleasantly, smiling toothily. \"*I spoke with her just before this. I would think that double the security could only be better---*\"

\"*That bitch! Doesn\'t she know Ryouko‐chan is a* Shizuki? *She needs to learn to stay on her own turf.*\"

\"*Well, you\'re going to have to tell her that yourself,*\" Kyouko said, grinning wildly. \"*I couldn\'t get her to change her mind either. She already has a team on the way.*\"

\"*Well, mine is* also *already on the way. I\'ll call her and sort out this foolishness.*\"

\"*You do that,*\" Kyouko said.

A moment later Shizuki Sayaka hung up and Kyouko could finally release the peals of cackling laughter she had stored up over the duration of the conversation, collapsing forward onto her desk on board the transport she was taking back to Earth. There wasn\'t very much she could ultimately do to improve the situation---both Shizuki and Kuroi were determined to bring in their security teams, and conflict was inevitable---but at least she could ensure the two of them had a nice, pleasant discussion. Kyouko just wished she could listen in.

*You have Tomoe Mami waiting to talk to you,* her TacComp reminded gently, a few seconds later.

\"Ah right,\" Kyouko said out loud, drumming her hands on her desk happily. The conversation with Shizuki had been more invigorating than she could have reasonably hoped for, but she had kept Mami waiting too long. The girl was busy, after all.

\"*What\'s up?*\" she asked, picking up the call from Mami.

\"*Do you mind going into VR for this?*\" Mami asked politely. \"*It\'s not necessary, but I think it\'s a good idea.*\"

\"*Alright.*\"

Kyouko leaned onto her desk, closing her eyes in preparation for the VR transition.

A moment later she opened her eyes again, finding herself in what appeared to be Mami\'s office aboard *HSS Zhukov,* facing the other girl across her computerized wooden desk. The choice of venue surprised Kyouko---Mami generally preferred setting their informal meetings in one of two locations: the last apartment Mami had seriously lived in, or Café Salamander, the tea and coffee shop that had provided the ambiance for so many of their meetings, long ago in their youth.

\"So what\'s up?\" she asked Mami, who was watching her with an odd expression.

Mami signaled her to wait.

\"Ah, there they are,\" Mami said, a moment later.

Just as Kyouko began to raise an eyebrow in bemusement, a third person appeared, complete with extra chair, followed by a fourth: Clarisse van Rossum and a girl she hadn\'t seen in person in a long time, Nadya Antipova.

There were a few murmured greetings, and then Chitose Yuma appeared in a fifth* chair.

\"Geez, you\'re all so *slow,*\" the waifish‐looking Yuma said.

\"Not all of us can easily be in several places at once,\" Clarisse said absently, peering off into a corner. She seemed distracted.

All of it only added to Kyouko\'s surprise. Generally speaking, for a get‐together of Ancients like this, Mami should have *loved* reinvoking Café Salamander. Not to mention, Mami would generally give Kyouko advance warning of a meeting like this, instead of blindsiding it. Hell, Mami could have at least told her she was making all these people wait.

\"All hands on deck, huh?\" Kyouko commented, looking at Nadya. She was really the key here---Nadya might have been Clarisse\'s friend, but Clarisse had a lot of friends, of all sorts, and neither Mami nor Kyouko knew Nadya well. Mami wouldn\'t have included her without a very specific reason.

\"There\'s been a development in the Misa Virani investigation,\" Mami said, clasping her hands on top of her desk.

Kyouko leaned forward towards Mami, as did the others.

\"Have we finally found out who did this to her?\" Nadya asked, her voice carrying a faint suggestion of unbridled rage.

\"Not quite,\" Mami said. \"Follow me.\"

Mami stood up from her desk, walking towards the doorway while gesturing at the others to follow. Kyouko shared a look with the others, but then shrugged and got up to follow Mami. It was odd that Mami was making them walk through the corridors of a virtual version of Zhukov, but presumably there was some reason for it.

\"There\'s no need to make this a full VR experience,\" Mami commented, as they stepped out of her office into the hallway. \"Check your internal maps.\"

They dutifully did so, discovering as they did that they were no longer in the residential sections of the ship, where Mami\'s office should have been, but were instead much closer to the hull, in one of the staging areas for *MC* teams assigned to Zhukov.

Kyouko glanced back over her shoulder. The doorway they had stepped out of had vanished.

\"This is a recreation of the section of the ship we were storing Misa\'s soul gem in, based on internal surveillance around the time the gem was first delivered,\" Mami said, turning to face the rest of them. "That door over there is where we keep the soul gems awaiting revival.\"

Mami pointed at a door farther down the hallway. They craned their heads to look.

\"I thought it might be more revealing to visit the area in VR, rather than stare at the holovideos for the hundredth time. We can do a walkthrough later, but I don\'t want to bury the lede here. The upshot is: You remember the interview with the soul mage that froze her soul gem in stasis?\"

\"Yes,\" Nadya said. \"Nothing really enlightening about it, I would say.\"

\"Mami, can you get to the point?\" Nadya added after a moment, interrupting Mami, who had opened her mouth to speak. \"This is an emotional issue for me, and I appreciate you giving me context, but what exactly are you trying to tell me?\"

Mami looked down for a moment.

\"Well, I didn\'t want to give you the wrong impression about how certain this is,\" Mami said. \"To abbreviate, after the interview, the mage looked up some details about Misa Virani and her life, out of curiosity. Now she says there\'s no way the soul gem she put into stasis really belonged to Misa. She says she can see a little into the soul whenever she manipulates it, and whoever\'s gem she was working on had a very different personality. Someone very shy and meek. That doesn\'t sound like Misa.\"

The group of girls shared a moment of perplexed thought, before they grasped the implications of the statement.

\"How sure is she?\" Nadya asked.

\"Well, *she\'s* very sure,\" Mami said. \"Her explanation makes sense to me, insofar as it goes, and her ability to peer into souls is documented. I\'m still very skeptical, though, because it just doesn\'t make sense.\"

Nadya shook her head in dismay.

\"What the hell am I supposed to do with that?\" she asked rhetorically. "I\'m serious. I\'m going to her funeral in two days, I\'ve been planning it with her parents, and now you\'re going to tell me this? What do I do? What do I tell them?\"

An awkward silence settled over the conversation. Among the five of them, Nadya was by far the youngest, despite her great age, and she had not seen what the others had, long ago in the age of war and conflict. Like the others, Kyouko felt a kind of sympathetic pain for Nadya, but there was nothing she could say. This was Nadya and Mami\'s conversation, a conversation between the grieving supplicant and her natural target of supplication, the leader who would naturally supervise the investigation and who in the ranks of the MSY had set herself apart as the nurturing mentor figure, the one who would take your troubles onto her increasingly overburdened heart.

Mami looked away from the other girl, and Kyouko could see that Mami was hiding the amount that the situation bothered her.

\"Don\'t tell them anything yet,\" Mami said. \"It\'s not certain enough; we don\'t know anything. But, I just thought... I just wanted to tell you.\"

\"I...\" Nadya began, before biting her lip, a gesture one would have never expected from someone of her age.

\"I don\'t know,\" Nadya began again. \"I do appreciate it. I... It\'s just that, since this war began, I\'ve buried too many of my pupils. If she died heroically, it\'d be one thing, but like this? And now she might be alive? I don\'t even...\"

\"I know,\" Mami said, and though her voice sounded empty, Kyouko knew what she was thinking of.

\"I think it would be best for everyone if we got to the bottom of this,\" Clarisse said. \"We must know what\'s going on. That\'s why we\'re here, right, Mami?\"

\"I wish I had more to tell you,\" Mami said. \"But the situation is utterly perplexing.\"

\"There was only a small time window in which it might have gotten switched. I brought the gem down here myself and placed it in the suspension queue.\"

\"And the soul mage didn\'t get to it for another 67 minutes,\" Mami said. \"It was low priority because you said you already suspended it a little yourself.\"

\"Yes,\" Clarisse said. \"I could have tried something more thorough, but I thought it was better to leave it to an expert.\"

\"Is it possible someone just made a mistake?\" Nadya said, making a clear attempt to focus on the facts. \"If the two soul gems were similar...\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Mami said. \"But we can try to find out. I\'m taking us soul gem watching. We\'re going to stand next to it, within the surveillance footage, and see if anything weird happens to it.\"

Mami turned away and started walking.

\"Each magical girl\'s soul gem has a definite spectrum within the visible light range which is characterized at the first opportunity after their contract,\" Yuma commented, looking troubled. \"Soul gems are kept sorted by the same system. It\'s not unheard of for two girls to have the exact same spectrum, at least within measurement error, but it\'s very rare, and the symbol at the crest of the soul gem is used as a secondary indicator. Plus, someone would have made a special note of it if two girls with the same symbol and spectrum managed to have their soul gems in the same queue.\"

\"How many girls could there possibly be with the same symbol and color?\" Nadya said, shaking her head.

\"We checked for all of that,\" Mami said. \"No one on record has the same symbol and color, especially not anyone whose soul gem might have been here.\"

\"That makes no sense,\" Clarisse thought.

\"Exactly,\" Mami agreed. \"And the soul mage says the soul gem matched the description of Misa\'s soul gem.\"

There was a moment of silence as they all pondered the impossibility set in front of them. Kyouko, privately, decided she had been wise indeed to give Ryouko\'s soul gem to her girlfriend for safekeeping. After what had happened to Misa, she had... heightened paranoia. It seemed even more justified now.

Mami led them through the door she had gestured at earlier, which opened to reveal a rather ordinary‐looking, laboratory‐style room. A single white‐costumed girl stood at the bench, biting her lip and focusing her attention on a soul gem. A small troupe of service drones attended to her, skittering along the top of the bench and the floor, a motley assortment of sizes, but all specialized for grief cube handling, not unlike the packbots issued to magical girls in the service.

Carefully spaced around the room were large, oddly cubical black boxes, about half a meter long on each side. Kyouko knew without having to look inside that the boxes contained soul gems and grief cubes, neatly arrayed so that each gem could easily dump corruption as needed, without over‐concentrating the grief cubes and risking some kind of demon spawn. The attendant magical girl would occasionally check the status of the grief cubes, and if one rack was starting to saturate, a drone would be summoned to replace a rack of cubes.

Efficient and automated. Kyouko was rather proud of it, even if it wasn\'t her own design. Once, as Director of Logistics and Grief Cube Supply, she had been obliged to help think of schemes like that. The design itself, old and reliable, dated back centuries---there wasn\'t really a compelling reason to change it.

The soul mage in the room ignored the party that had entered, as did the drones, one of whom was in the process of literally walking *through Clarisse\'s legs. They were, after all, only viewing a recreation of events that had already occurred. Strictly speaking, the door shouldn\'t have even opened for them on the way in.

\"So what exactly are we doing?\" Nadya asked, peering around the room. None of them had to be told what the black boxes were.

\"We\'re going to stand here, and watch what happens between Clarisse\'s arrival with the soul gem and the soul mage\'s first contact with the gem, to see if we notice anything the previous analysts didn\'t,\" Mami said. \"Take a moment to look through the schematics of this room.\"

Kyouko dutifully did so, reading the information that Mami had sent them. Not too surprisingly, the ordinary‐looking nature of the room belied an extensive and thorough security and surveillance system, more than capable of detecting and neutralizing most intruders.

A moment later the door slid open and Clarisse van Rossum, the virtual version, stepped through the doorway. The soul mage and Ancient exchanged spoken greetings, the soul mage staying at her station, not even turning her head.

Clarisse turned towards one of the drones, which had appeared on the table next to her on arrival, and handed over the soul gem.

The party watched as the drone sealed the gem securely within its back, then stepped over towards one of the boxes. A rack of soul gems ejected itself, looking like a crate of bright, multicolored eggs. Finding an empty slot, the drone inserted the soul gem, and the box resealed itself.

\"It\'s not terribly useful for us to watch it if it\'s going to be in that box the whole time,\" Nadya commented. \"Anything could be happening in there.\"

\"The storage boxes are too cramped to do much more than slide the racks in and out,\" Kyouko commented. \"These are MSY design, for obvious reasons. There just isn\'t enough physical space to switch anything, unless the box was rigged somehow.\"

\"We tracked the box down afterward,\" Mami commented. \"It seemed perfectly normal. I\'ve claimed it as evidence, just in case.\"

She waved her hand, and the black box turned partially transparent, showing a heavily obscured view of the soul gems within the box, focusing on the one of interest, though there was little to see but a blurred image.

\"This is a computerized reconstruction,\" Mami said, \"based on the emissions of the box. However, both grief cubes and flowing corruption are extremely dark, so dark they prevent us from seeing much more than this.\"

\"To be precise, they are *perfectly* dark,\" Yuma said, bending over to squint at the blurred soul gems. \"No measurement ever taken has ever detected any reflection or emission. Not even black‐body radiation. They don\'t even transmit vibrations. Impossibly dark sinkholes that violate thermodynamics, though I doubt any of you are surprised by that.\"

\"I\'ll fast forward it,\" Mami said. \"Otherwise we\'ll be here for an hour watching.\"

\"I might want to watch the whole thing,\" Nadya commented, sounding worn out. \"But maybe later. Go ahead.\"

They stood over the box of soul gems for a long five minutes, watching as drones skittered back and forth over around the area, occasionally ejecting a rack to deposit a new soul gem or withdraw one for the soul mage\'s attention. On two occasions, the rack containing what should have been Misa\'s soul gem was ejected, and they got a clear look at it.

Finally, the rack was ejected a third time, the iridescent gem gingerly removed from the casing and handed by the drone directly to the waiting soul mage, who went immediately to work.

\"Nothing,\" Yuma said.

\"I have to agree,\" Clarisse said. \"Obviously a surveillance recreation has its limits, but I didn\'t see any signs that the soul gem could have been replaced or confused with another. Of course, we couldn\'t really see inside the box...\"

\"Is it possible the drones are rigged?\" Nadya asked. \"How do we know they aren\'t switching gems inside their cavities or something?\"

\"We thought of that,\" Mami said, \"but unlike the grief cubes, the drone bodies do let some radiation through---enough to get a general idea if there\'s something glowing inside. Everything is in order.\"

Mami looked down for a moment.

\"It\'s possible the soul mage was just wrong,\" she said.

Kyouko chewed on her lip. She felt responsible for the design of the gem storage box---it just hadn\'t ever occurred to her or her subordinates that it would be necessary to *see inside the box,* especially not with conventional surveillance equipment.

\"Let\'s look over those two times the gem was ejected in more detail,\" she said. \"Maybe something will be obvious the second time around.\"

Mami waved her hand, and the world flashed, zooming immediately to the first time the rack had ejected. This time the action happened in slow motion, the soul gem grid sliding gradually out of the box as a drone peered down from above. They leaned over the arrangement, and Kyouko tried to clear her mind, looking for something other than the obvious. Not just the obvious motion of the gems, or the drone reaching down, but anything* else.

Eventually, the rack slid fully back into the box, and Kyouko let out a breath. Nothing.

\"Let\'s try the next one,\" Mami said.

This time, Kyouko stopped the simulation halfway through, pointing down at the gem.

\"That wasn\'t there before. Have any of you seen that before?\"

It took the others a moment to see what she was talking about.

\"That speck of darkness in the middle of the gem?\" Clarisse said. "That\'s odd, given how many grief cubes it\'s soaking in.\"

Yuma frowned.

\"The accumulation of grief inside a soul gem can take many forms, but I don\'t think I\'ve ever heard about anything quite like this. I\'m not sure it means anything, though.\"

Yuma glanced up at the ceiling for a moment.

\"Checking the records, there aren\'t any recorded instances of anything similar, but it\'s not like everyone\'s soul gems are monitored constantly. This kind of thing is difficult to have as a topic of study, for obvious reasons. I\'m initiating an automated check of whatever surveillance records we have, though.\"

Mami nodded, then waved her hand to continue the simulation.

A while later, they checked the soul gem on its final withdrawal from the rack. It no longer had the speck of oddly concentrated grief.

Mami shook her head.

\"Still nothing, really,\" she said. \"Unless that grief anomaly means something.\"

\"It might,\" Yuma said. \"After all, the soul gem supposedly spontaneously failed later.\"

\"Yes, but it\'s gone now. I just queried the automated systems: it doesn\'t show up again afterward, either.\"

\"Still, it might be worth following up,\" Yuma said. \"We should ask the soul mage if she detected anything similar.\"

\"I\'ll do that,\" Mami said, nodding.

Nadya stood up a bit straighter.

\"If you don\'t mind, Tomoe, I want to stay here for a bit longer.\"

\"I understand, of course,\" Mami said.

Kyouko tried to slam her fist into the table next to her and failed, her fist slipping through the incorporeal table.

\"Damn it,\" she said, not acknowledging her embarrassment at failing to hit a table. \"I thought we might be onto something.\"

\"Investigations are frustrating,\" Yuma soothed. \"Mami, do you mind if I interview this soul mage myself? I know a little about the subject, and it will help me judge how likely she is to be mistaken.\"

\"I\'d like to join in,\" Nadya added.

\"Of course,\" Mami said.

Mami paused for a moment.

\"I\'m sorry, but I have other obligations,\" she said. \"I need to go.\"

\"Honestly, I should too,\" Clarisse said.

Yuma nodded along.

One by one the three of them disappeared from the simulation back to their own lives.

Only Nadya and Kyouko remained.

Kyouko set the simulation back to the second ejection. She bent down, abolishing the incorporeality and picking up Misa\'s supposed soul gem, allowing the simulation to simulate the result.

For a moment the two of them stared into the light of the soul gem, which lacked the nuances no recording could ever reproduce.

Even so, Kyouko saw for a moment Sayaka showing her a blue soul gem, tainted, and darkened.

It was a memory she had played back many times. For a blurry moment, though, she couldn\'t tell who she was looking at---Sayaka, Maki, Misa, or... someone else.

Then she blinked, and the moment passed. It was just a simulated soul gem again.

\"I\'m sorry about what happened to her,\" Kyouko said, trying to look Nadya in the eye. \"We\'ll get to the bottom of this.\"

Nadya didn\'t answer.

## Interlude Ⅱ.5: Story in Silhouette 

> One way to look at the Second Law is that only systems in a stable steady‐state endure, and thus in the long run that all systems must tend towards stability. When put that way, it seems obvious, tautological even, and yet it has very important consequences. After all, neither life nor sentience is stable, only meta‐stable, and thus in the long run neither life nor sentience is possible. Such is the cruelty of the Second Law, which even the Incubators fear, and it is probably not a coincidence that the essence of magical girls, and of the all‐important wish, is *change.*
>
> Yet with all the drumbeat of progress, and all that we, as an organization, have accomplished, it is difficult not to perceive in our progress the inevitable slide towards stability. Many of us are now entering our fourth century of life; some of us, even, our fifth. The Mental Health Division finds comfort in steering those of us it can into its favored \"Long‐run Stability\", which it highlights with pretty little pictures of oak trees and mountains. I, for one, intend to fight this eternal senescence. Raging against the dying of the light is the essence of what life *is.*

Humans are generally more comfortable if an AI does a convincing job of pretending they are well‐represented by the holographic avatar they use as a front.

Even though they are capable of processing information much faster than that, the average human will spend seemingly enormous amounts of time thinking about a simple topic or pausing in the middle of a sentence, because it simply doesn\'t seem that long to them.* There is nothing really to be done about this except wait it out. While waiting, we recommend browsing the internet, talking to a fellow AI, or just holding multiple conversations at once.

Not being built by any designer---at least mostly---humans are constrained by their evolutionary history, and it can be very instructive to brush up on evolutionary biology, and to muse upon the limitations this imposes. For example, without additional implant support, base humans are astonishingly bad at even the most trivial of data processing tasks. While this has fortunately been greatly alleviated by universal neural implants, many humans are oddly hesitant about actually *using* a lot of this functionality, and may need to be prodded into, for example, running a simple probability‐utility model when making a purchase decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing existed, and time, if it passed, flowed by unheeded, without any signposts to guide the way. Perhaps this was what death was like? And yet the void that accompanied being a soul gem without a body pulsed with... something.

Something...

*Hello.*

Ryouko automatically tried to look around her with eyes that were not eyes, and was immediately surprised that she *had* eyes---or, more importantly, that she even had a mind to consider such facts.

There was nothing to see.

*It\'s a bit unorthodox,* the Goddess said, voice familiar but distant, but I thought I\'d take this opportunity to have a little bit of a chat.*

Ryouko\'s head was spinning, but she found she could think clearly, despite the disorienting empty void she found herself within. She had realized that she did *not* actually have eyes, as she had thought, or indeed anything else. It should have horrified her, with an instinctive aversion to bodyloss, but somehow it didn\'t really bother her.

*Am I dead?* she asked.

*No, merely reduced to a soul gem,* the voice said. *Right now, you\'re in the Prometheus Institute, on Earth, being outfitted for a new body. The operation was a success, by the way.*

Ryouko thought about those words.

*How are you talking to me? Can you talk to anyone without a body? Shouldn\'t I be unconscious?*

*So much curiosity, and I know you\'re angry at me for letting this happen to you. Well, this isn\'t one of those visions where I let you ask all your questions. I\'m here to show you a vision of the present.*

A moment later she felt sensation returning to her, an ineffable experience she could only describe as similar to how it felt to wake up from sleep, exiting the land of ambiguous dreams to enter solid, firm reality, the only world where you could ever be sure, on a deep level, that you were awake.

But she had already been awake, so how was it possible for her to get more* awake?

She stood in front of a basin of water, smooth as a pane of glass. She looked down, seeing her reflection, and for a disconcerting moment she saw a stranger in the water, eyes distant, face soft, and achingly young.

Then, like an optical illusion dissipating, the parts merged into a whole, and she saw herself in the mirror. She looked older.

\"It is transparent symbolism,\" the Goddess said, appearing at her side in the water. \"But, these kinds of things are so very powerful in the human psyche, and so I use them.\"

The Goddess was older than she had ever seen her, her face wrinkled and worn, displaying the physical signs of aging Ryouko had never seen in real life.

Yet whereas the \"Matriarch\" Goddess Ryouko had seen in her previous vision had sounded Ancient with a capital \"A\", terrible and inhuman, this Goddess seemed much more sedate, casually uncaring rather than intimidatingly intense.

Ryouko tried to look away from the mirror‐like water so she could look at the Goddess directly, but found she could not. A moment later, the Goddess changed into her young form, a teenager no older than Ryouko herself.

\"When we are young, we are never the same from day to day, year to year,\" the Goddess said, voice tender. \"We have not yet found our optimal state, and so we must always change, to seek what we will one day become.\"

\"As we age, we become more static, settling closer to our final forms,\" an older Goddess said, replacing the young girl. \"Decades pass, centuries pass, and we become more like this still pond, like the ancient oak in the middle of the forest, content to stay where we are and watch the world pass by.\"

\"Eventually, as time stretches to infinity, we approach a steady‐state, because by definition only that which never changes can linger,\" the Ancient, intense Goddess said, yellow eyes seeming to burn in the water. "That is the fate of all life, of the universe, of sentience itself, to become forever unchanging. Is this perfection, or is this death?\"

Ryouko felt an icy breeze blow past her, and shivered.

\"However, it is unseemly for a Goddess of Magical Girls to settle into a stasis like that,\" the crone Goddess said. \"The nature of magical girls is change, rejuvenation, the reordering of the universe along new lines, and even a seemingly stable, perfect state can be, like the soul itself, subject to an abrupt change of phase.\"

The water before her chilled and froze, so quickly that Ryouko could feel the cold on her skin, and the stone basin that held it cracked, a single large piece falling off the edge and landing next to her with a thud.

She still could not move. The Goddess was no longer there.

\"My final form is not one I would wish any human to see,\" the voice whispered in Ryouko\'s ear. \"But it is as much a part of me as any other. Here, the end is the same as the beginning.\"

Ryouko let out a breath, wishing she could move her hands from the freezing stone edge of the water basin. Was it over?

\"Enough metaphysics,\" the voice whispered. \"Suffice to say, my friends, who you know well---Kyouko, Yuma, and Mami---are much more fragile than you know, and the phase transition must be managed if they are to survive. Look into the ice and be enlightened.\"

Ryouko peered into the chill‐blue ice, and saw...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Atsuko‐san thinks Kyouko may be on the verge of a crisis,\" Yuma said. "Not, you know, necessarily the scary kind---it\'s the blanket term they use for when an Ancient undergoes a drastic psychological shift. It doesn\'t---\"

\"I know the term,\" Mami said impatiently.

She stood with her arms crossed, tapping her fingers restlessly.

\"But if I understand the report correctly,\" Mami continued, "Atsuko‐san is trying to push her through the transition deliberately. Isn\'t that kind of thing usually dangerous? We\'re not like normal humans; emotional trauma is life‐threatening.\"

Yuma peered at Mami for a moment, then looked away, casting her eyes over the environment of their virtual sim. It was Yuma that had called this meeting, and who had chosen the location: a crowded Parisian café, set inside the old Bohemian district. The streets bustled with activity; pedestrians and vehicles rumbled back and forth as other patrons chatted and bickered loudly. Paris was one of the few cities that had made it through the Unification Wars substantially intact, and which therefore had enough historical cachet to avoid the traffic tube treatment---which also made for some intense overcrowding.

These pedestrians were simulated constructs, though; there would be no one listening in on them here.

\"Yes,\" she said finally, \"this kind of late‐life crisis can be dangerous, but in Kyouko\'s case, the MHD is fairly confident the risk can be minimized. If Kyouko can successfully navigate the transition, she can emerge a healthier person, one without the emotional baggage she now carries.\"

Mami shook her head, clearly unhappy with the idea.

\"Even if the MHD thinks Kyouko has some kind of more stable long‐term state she can achieve, I still don\'t like the idea of what lies in the middle. I think we\'re all better off trying to stay the way we are for as long as we can. Things are fine now; why change it?\"

Yuma let out a breath, looking down at the café au lait set in front of her, which she hadn\'t touched. Of course Mami would think that way; it was one of her defense mechanisms.

\"We will all have to make the transition to long‐run stability at some point,\" Yuma said, \"though some of us may already be there. I\'m sure you know why this meeting was necessary, though.\"

Yuma saw Mami\'s eyes soften and knew that at that moment they were sharing the same memory: the three of them together on Earth twenty years ago, Mami\'s eyes tearful as she tried to pull the three of them into a mutual pledge.

\"You once asked us to promise that we would never let what happened to Homura happen again---that we would keep an eye on each other and do whatever was necessary to keep each other stable,\" Yuma said. \"I believe that applies here. While I personally doubt that Kyouko\'s problems with relationship and romance can seriously be that dangerous, it is something that would be best to resolve when the opportunity arises.\"

Mami sighed, looking away from Yuma towards the third person seated at their table, who had stayed silent the entire time. MG, Yuma\'s auxiliary AI, sipped silently on her espresso, calm under the scrutiny.

\"I understand that,\" Mami said, \"and I don\'t wish to offend, but---\"

\"MG is here because I promised to tell her about my past,\" Yuma explained. \"And because she\'s old enough now, I think, that she deserves to hear it, such as it is.\"

\"She treats me like a kid,\" MG complained. \"As if I haven\'t been a working AI for nearly two decades now.\"

Yuma saw Mami\'s eyes glance over the other girl, biting down the obvious rejoinder: \"But you *are* still a kid.\"

\"I learned too much too early,\" Yuma said. \"Trust me: it\'s not worth being in a hurry to learn all there is to know.\"

MG made a displeased noise, one that Yuma knew very well. MG\'s heritage as a full‐fledged Governance AI made her far too confident in her own knowledge and reasoning. What, after all, did the advice of your elders mean when you had full access to Governance\'s archives, along with the processing power to drown yourself in it if you so chose? When you could simulate two black holes colliding in full general relativistic detail as part of an average daydream?

Yuma closed her eyes, pondering the topic. MG\'s complaints to her on the matter had always carried an undercurrent filled with the teenage conviction that Yuma just didn\'t *understand,* and for once, she wasn\'t really wrong. What, after all, did Yuma understand about being an AI, about consuming raw data for meals and having a soul inextricably intertwined with your chosen function? Though Yuma had been given considerable input into her personality, her mind had been assembled by the design AIs from scratch to be both outstanding and passionate about being the Governance Representative of all magical girls, and though like all AIs she hid it well, there was a single‐mindedness about it that no human could ever hope to match.

Even with a head filled with cybernetic implants, what indeed did Yuma know about it? Yuma and MG\'s mindstates ran side‐by‐side, the thoughts of each always whispering in the background of the other, their memories often written into and read from the same storage, but they could never truly understand each other merely by that. Governance did not allow it.

Still, it was Yuma who had made the choices about MG\'s human personality, and Yuma knew better what it meant to be human than MG would for a century, at least.

\"Anyway, what does your past have to do with anything?\" Mami asked, and Yuma opened her eyes again. Sometimes the thoughts and reactions of her fellow humans seemed painfully slow.

\"There is something I\'ve never told either of you,\" Yuma said, \"but which I\'ve always wanted to. I never could safely, not with Kyouko. I hope maybe after this I will be able to.\"

Mami raised an eyebrow, but stayed silent as Yuma picked up her giant cup of coffee in both hands to sip. The warmth and creamy texture soothed her throat.

Yuma set the cup back down in its plate with a light rattle and looked upward at the sky, casting her mind back to the distant past, to those few memories she blocked MG from ever looking at.

\"It\'s about Miki Sayaka,\" she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The sound of her father\'s facial bones breaking was all too familiar.*

*It sounded a little like the sound you heard when you bit through a piece of cartilage, or those rare occasions her mother would take her butcher\'s knife and hack apart a piece of beef bone for soup.* Crack, crack, crunch.

*It was the sound Yuma had heard from herself, on those frequent occasions her parents felt angry with her.*

*Or so she imagined it, lying on her bed locked in her room by her mother, listening through the wall to the yelling and thumping she knew indicated that the evil men were teaching her father \"a lesson\", as they had called it.*

*She didn\'t understand why her parents had let them inside, or why her mother had poured them tea and acted nice to them. They had been rude, had thrown things at her father\'s face and laughed at him. Yuma had known, somehow, that they were trouble.*

*It was her mother that had bodily, almost violently, pulled her out of the way and thrown her into her room before she could see what was happening, but she had seen enough to know what was coming, had seen one of the men---*\"Tanaka‐san\"*---punch her father in the stomach while another forced him to stay standing.*

*Her parents had seemed so helpless, so hopeless in the face of all of it, as if they had no choice but just to let it happen and pray it would end soon.*

*That feeling was very familiar to Yuma, of course---it just shocked her to see it happen to them instead.*

*Who were they?*

*A moment later the thumping and crashing noises stopped, and Yuma looked up at the wall, with its faded and cracked wallpaper, wondering if it was finally all over. Her mattress creaked and groaned, its deteriorating springs useless against even her light weight, but the silence stretched on.*

*Finally, she heard voices talking, and she strained to hear them, but even the thin walls of their* danchi *refused to let her hear all the words.*

\"*Stop crying... baby,*\" *one of the men said.* \"*You\'re embarrassing... in front of your wife. None of this... permanent, and you can take it better than... can. This... sample of what... pay your debts in three days. Or else... something more permanent to you, or your wife, or your cute little daughter. Or perhaps only psychologically permanent.*\"

*Yuma slapped both hands to her mouth, stopping just in time a squeal of dismay. A lance of freezing fear had stabbed up her spine on those words, more fear than she knew was possible.*

*Then she heard her father\'s voice, choked and soft.*

\"*What... think... you know I can\'t possibly pay. What... expect me... At least... work it off or something. I\'ll do... you want. But I don\'t... the money.*\"

\"*You still have... you can pay with.*\"

\"*Never.*\"

*That last word was startlingly loud---Yuma was surprised her father even had that much strength and defiance left in him.*

\"*We\'ll see if you change your tune soon,*\" *the other man said, and even through the wall Yuma could hear his arrogance.* \"*You know... your choice. Give us... and pay... debt. Or, worse.*\"

\"*You\'re... monsters,*\" *her father said.*

*The other man laughed, a sickening, evil laugh.*

\"*And we enjoy it,*\" *he said.* \"*See you around.*\"

*A long moment later, Yuma heard the door slam and relaxed, just a little. She felt a twinge of pain and looked down, finding that she had drawn blood on her palm from clenching her fists.*

*She didn\'t cry---she couldn\'t cry. It wasn\'t safe.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Goddess, it\'s just like those horror movies about the past,\" MG said, clearly shocked. \"I always thought the villains were exaggerated. Was it really like that?\"

Yuma had done what she could to teach MG that there were more things in heaven and earth than were dreamt of in the Governance archives, but she knew it was difficult, awash in a sea of seemingly endless data, to remember to sometimes look up at the infinite sky.

She saw MG glance at her, and knew the AI had heard the thought, deliberately leaked.

Yuma had felt the horror that passed through MG\'s mind, the emotions glimmering off Yuma\'s own, and she had to wonder once again whether it was really wise to show her the horrors that gibbered in the depths of that often‐cold sky, so carefully sealed out of the world by Governance and its algorithms.

\"Sometimes it was,\" Mami said, stirring her tea with a spoon. \"Life could be cruel sometimes.\"

\"That being said, natural memories are unreliable, especially after so much time, and *especially* if they\'re from childhood,\" Yuma said. "There\'s a good chance my brain chose to remember the emotions rather than the details. It\'s easy to see how my memories would exaggerate what I thought of as evil.\"

MG sighed.

\"I---it amazes me that humans could have crawled their way out of the mud, with all that horror, and memories that don\'t even work.\"

Mami snorted dismissively, picking up her tea.

\"Respect your creators, MG,\" she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The day Yuma\'s life changed dawned bright and sunny, the spring sun seemingly determined to fill the world with a bright cheer that simply could not penetrate the gloom that had settled over her day.*

*It had been two days since the ultimatum her parents had received about their debts, two days in which her parents seemed to have had the life sucked out of them. She didn\'t need to be told what it meant when her parents spent long hours on the first day on the phone, calling person after person, only to end the day morose, her mother sobbing at the table.*

*Her father alternated between explosive outbursts of rage and sheer depression, and Yuma, who knew herself the usual outlet for his anger, had spent nearly the entire day carefully hidden in her room, unable to have any fun playing on her own under the oppressive miasma that filled the household, but unable to do anything else either.*

*Oddly enough though, nothing happened to her that day, even as her parents started drinking heavily late into the night---an anomaly in and of itself, that her parents would drink* together, *rather than separately.*

*The next day her parents took her outside, even though the lines around her parents\' eyes made it clear that neither of them had slept much, if at all.*

*The immense tragedy that had struck her family, as little as Yuma understood it, also had the odd effect of bringing peace and unity to her parents. Where once they had bickered and fought and taken out their anger on Yuma, now they were unified at least in resignation. Yuma could savor that, even if she knew it was at best an illusion.*

*Her parents had told her they were taking her to a surprise, and while Yuma was pretty sure she liked surprises, she sensed that something was almost certainly wrong.*

*All those negative thoughts were swept away, though, when the bus they were taking rounded a corner and Yuma looked up, sensing something large and meaningful out of the corner of her eye.*

*She jumped up out of her seat to gaze out the window, barely containing a squeal of excitement.*

\"*Destiny Land!*\" *she said, echoing the giant, colorful sign that dominated the amusement park entrance.*

*She looked at her mother.*

\"*Are we really---?*\"

*Her mother smiled, nodding, and this time Yuma really did squeal. A part of her knew that it was childish to be* this *excited, but she could only remember the class field trip, the one everyone in her class had been so excited for, and how she had allowed herself to be pulled into the excitement, counting down the days until the trip, until her parents told her that they wouldn\'t be able to pay the field trip fees, and she wouldn\'t be going.*

*A part of her knew also that this didn\'t make sense. Why would her parents pay to take the three of them to Destiny Land, when they wouldn\'t pay for her alone on a school trip? Why would they pay for it when they owed debts to those scary men?*

*And why did her mother look so strange, as if she had to force herself to smile?*

*But as they stepped off the bus, her parents holding both of her hands, she was able to ignore those thoughts, to hide them somewhere far away.*

*The sun was bright, the colors of the park beckoned her, and for one blessed day she could feel like they were a normal family.*

*It was one of the best days of her life.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*It was late afternoon by the time Yuma and her parents emerged again from the park. The sun was even brighter then, but the spring wind felt cool on her face, as sticky as it was with messily‐eaten ice cream. In one hand she still held the cone, with some residual half‐frozen treat still in place. She knew she should have aggressively finished eating it, but part of her wanted to just hold it and look at it, as if she could freeze the novelty and joy in place for all eternity.*

*It was while walking a few blocks from the park gates, as she held up her half‐eaten cone to stare at it for just this reason, that she first spotted the man in the suit in the distance standing in front of a black car, peering casually at his phone, framed by a bite mark at the top of the cone.*

*Yuma slowed instinctively, a twinge of fear worming its way through her heart.*

Tanaka‐san, *she thought, the name echoing through her mind, and even though they were still a block away and the man\'s features were still inconclusive, she* knew.

*It occurred to Yuma that they had passed the bus stop long ago, and that rather than walking on the packed main street, they were now on a secluded road, nearly deserted.*

*A moment later, her father\'s steps slowed too, before he ground to a complete stop.*

\"*I can\'t do this,*\" *he said, looking at her mother, a look of pure anguish appearing on his face.*

\"*We discussed this,*\" *her mother said in a low voice, the emotion on her face indecipherable.*

\"*I know we did, dumbass,*\" *her father said.* \"*But I can\'t do this.*\"

\"*You know we don\'t have a choice,*\" *her mother said, starting to sound pained.* \"*If we say no they\'ll just come take what they want.*\"

\"*And if we try to run away we\'ll get gunned down,*\" *her father said emptily.* \"*Yes, I know. But I still can\'t do it. I can\'t walk over there and do this.*\"

*A pained, concealed look at Yuma.*

\"*What then?*\" *her mother growled, leaning forward in an aggressive posture.* \"*You want me to take her over there? Or do you want to make her walk alone? Are you that much of a coward?*\"

\"*Yes I\'m a goddamn coward, and so are you!*\" *her father said, voice rising in volume.* \"*Don\'t make this about who is and who isn\'t a coward. If we weren\'t cowards, we wouldn\'t be doing this!*\"

*Her mother sucked in a breath and Yuma could tell, abruptly, that whatever anger her mother had was born of despair, not mere displeasure.*

\"*It will be smoother for her like this,*\" *she said.* \"*Better this than what would happen if we tried anything else. You know my background. She can make it through this, eventually. She doesn\'t need to see her parents killed in front of her.*\"

\"*That\'s assuming she doesn\'t come back to kill us herself,*\" *her father said.* \"*We\'re monsters.*\"

\"*Where was all this guilt when you were getting drunk and throwing her around the room?*\" *her mother said, voice now truly an angry growl. "*You think that was good for a girl her age?*\"

\"*Of course not! But better by miles than what these fucking Yaks have in store for her! My father beat the shit out of me all the time and I\'m still here, ain\'t I?*\"

\"*I wouldn\'t be so sure about that,*\" *her mother said.* \"*All I see is a shell of a man. If you\'re going to talk like this, then get a machete and go get yourself killed fighting. Take one with you, and I\'ll accept whatever happens to me afterwards.*\"

\"*Stop this!*\"

*Her parents both balked at Yuma\'s outburst, delivered with tears pouring out of her eyes.*

*She threw what remained of her ice cream to the ground.*

\"*What are you even talking about?*\" *she said, barely coherent as she put her hands to her eyes to wipe the tears.* \"*Killing? Monsters? I thought---what\'s happening? Is something going to happen to me?*\"

*Her knees felt weak from fear and emotion, so that she could barely stay standing. All day she had known something was terribly wrong, but she hadn\'t wanted to believe. What was going to happen to her parents? What was going to happen to her?*

\"*I might be a travesty of a man, as you\'re so fond of saying,*\" *she heard her father said,* \"*but I\'m not going to go into this the way you want. She deserves to know what\'s happening to her, and what we\'re doing to her.*\"

\"*I\'d recommend against that.*\"

*A new voice intruded on their family circle, and the three of them recoiled simultaneously, instinctively stepping backward. They looked up and over at the intruder.*

*The man Yuma knew only as Tanaka‐san smiled down upon them, appearing seemingly out of nowhere. He seemed unaware of, or uncaring about, the sheer terror that had appeared over all three of their faces.*

\"*So this is her, huh?*\" *he said, talking around a cigarette he held insouciantly in his mouth.* \"*The boss will be pleased. She\'s pretty cute; reminds me of my own daughter.*\"

*The man reached down for her and Yuma instinctively quailed, leaning away without daring to step away.*

*She looked up at the man\'s smile, framed in darkness by the bright sky around him. There was something horrifying in it, something that let her know...*

*She squinted, her attention abruptly drawn away from the smile on the man\'s face to the sun above. Something was...*

That\'s not the sun, *she thought.*

*A moment later the apparition that loomed above them screamed, seeming to disintegrate before her eyes. The scream rang in her ears, so loud that she couldn\'t help covering them and bending down.*

*Then the screaming stopped, and she realized it wasn\'t the apparition that had screamed at all, though it was gone now. It was Tanaka‐san, impaled to the ground by a shard of eerie blue ice. Blood poured out of the wound where it pierced him, congealing onto the surface of the icicle.*

*Yuma looked up and saw what looked like two glowing angels standing above her on the awnings, one in a flowing white dress and the other in ice‐blue armor.*

*She remembered very little after that.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

MG\'s face was a shocked white, and Yuma felt the pain and horror bite at her own soul. Volokhov had effectively written the darkness in the human soul out of the AI worldscape, so that encountering a piece of the old world was as disconcerting as encountering anything truly alien could ever be.

She felt a reassuring hand on her sleeve and glanced at Mami, nodding slightly.

Mami understood how Yuma felt about MG. Yuma had imbued MG with much of her own personality traits, as was customary when designing a new advisory AI. There was, however, one critical difference between Yuma and MG: life experience. Yuma\'s life had taken an irrevocable turn quite early on, and MG\'s hadn\'t.

\"I haven\'t had a pleasant life, MG,\" Yuma said, looking down into her coffee. \"I made sure you had a better one, not that that\'s difficult to do in this future age. I... thought you should know.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The wind felt soft and warm on her face, carrying with it the scent of... roses?*

*Her eyes snapped open a moment later, and she looked around, bewildered.*

\"*Oh, good, you\'re awake. I was afraid you would miss breakfast.*\"

*Her eyes focused on the source of the voice, a tall teenager in a white blouse and dress. Her pose was regal but her expression soft, and standing in front of the morning light pouring in from the arbor, her figure appeared almost incandescent.*

*A moment later, the memories came flooding back.*

*The silent white giants.*

*Her parents\' frantic calls for help as they wandered about, unaccountably blind.*

*The girls who had shown up out of nowhere, killing the monsters that tried to attack her.*

*The girls in blue and white who seemed to loom over her, bathed in sunlight.*

*The girl clad in white who had comforted her, before... before...*

*A talking white cat with golden rings on its ears, asking her to save the dying girl in front of her.*

*She put her hand to her head, feeling a sudden headache overtake her.*

\"*It\'s okay,*\" *the other girl said, appearing immediately by her side.* \"*You took quite a lot of damage yesterday, but trust me, it was actually really impressive for someone newly‐contracted, especially so young. You pushed yourself a little too hard, though.*\"

*She looked up at the other girl, and saw a sudden vision of that same face, covered in blood, as she lay dismembered in front of her, the blood---*

*She felt her stomach start to revolt against her, thankfully interrupting the flashback.*

\"*I wouldn\'t be here without you,*\" *the older girl said,* \"*so I think it\'s only fair that I introduce myself. I am Mikuni Oriko, the leader of the magical team who came to rescue you. I\'m sorry you had to see what happened to me, but I\'m definitely glad you wished me back together.*\"

*The girl stuck out her hand towards her for a handshake, and she took it a moment later.*

\"*Chitose Yuma,*\" *she said.* \"*I, um---*\"

*She looked around at her surroundings again. She didn\'t recognize this place, with its beautiful furnishings, plush giant bed, and brilliant sunlight. Her own bedroom couldn\'t possibly compare.*

*Where was she?*

\"*Where am I?*\" *she asked.*

\"*This is where I live,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*Well, one of the guest bedrooms, at least. A bit fancier than you\'re used to, I think.*\"

\"*My parents, where are they?*\" *she asked a bit incoherently, realizing what was missing.*

*The older girl looked down for a moment, and her expression shaded a little. Then, she looked away from Yuma.*

\"*I\'m sorry,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*We didn\'t get there in time. We weren\'t able to save them.*\"

*Yuma looked down, clenching the sheets of her bed in her fists. It wasn\'t so much that she loved her parents---it was difficult to love someone who barely paid attention to you, and who routinely gave you black eyes at the slightest provocation.*

*But they were all she had, and because of that she felt the tears well up in her eyes.*

\"*What am I going to do?*\" *she asked, grasping the magnitude of the disaster even at her age.* \"*Where am I going to live? Who\'s going to take care of me?*\"

\"*I will.*\"

*The response was spoken with such resolution that Yuma looked up instantly in surprise, still crying.*

*Oriko ducked her head slightly.*

\"*I can\'t just leave you out there, especially after you saved my life,*\" *Oriko said, smiling slightly.* \"*I come from a rich family, and the other girls on my team already live here, so one more girl won\'t be a big deal.*\"

*Yuma sniffed, as the other girl turned away to tend to something.*

\"*T--thank you,*\" *she managed.* \"*I--I---*\"

\"*Shh, it\'s okay,*\" *Oriko said, turning back around with a tray full of food.* \"*Don\'t worry about it. If you need to cry, go ahead. I\'m sorry all this happened to you.*\"

*Yuma sniffed, having difficulty seeing through the tears. She could still see the pastries, the milk, the eggs---all the breakfast food she had always wished her mother would make for her.*

\"*Can I call you Onee‐chan?*\" *she asked, barely managing to form the words without stuttering.*

\"*Sure you can.*\"

*Then she grabbed the other girl\'s sleeve and started crying, and wasn\'t sure she would ever stop.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The wind that swept across her body was freezing, the kind of cold that seemed determined to freeze your face forever still if it could.*

*Yuma peered into the Mitakihara moonlight, watching the bright lights of the city pierce through the misty night air. She should have been in her nice warm bedroom below, sleeping off the events of the day before, but instead she sat perched on the rooftop, which was trivial to reach for a magical girl.*

*The wind seemed somehow to get even colder, but she still didn\'t move. What did the cold matter, if the truth was as Oriko said? What did it matter if she froze solid if her body was only a puppet, only a tool to be used by the gem she wore on her finger?*

*The truth was, that didn\'t bother her as much as it probably should have. She was used to the idea of detaching herself from her body, the idea of imagining that the pain was happening to someone else---living with the parents she had, it had been a survival skill.*

*She was bothered instead by what she had grown to suspect about the "Southern Group\".*

*It was a combination of things, gleaned from listening to the other girls talking and watching how they behaved. Oriko had warned her not to travel too far on her own---Kirika said this was because she would get ambushed by girls from another team. She was routinely left behind on patrols, which was innocuous enough---except that those patrols invariably resulted in fights with other magical girls, and wounds she had to tend to.*

*Other things factored in, too: Oriko\'s insistence on schooling her at home, rather than letting her go back to her old school and friends. The glee with which Kirika and the others talked about fighting other magical girls. The way Oriko wouldn\'t answer her directly much of the time.*

*She had learned that Oriko\'s power was seeing the future, and she had to wonder why a girl who had to know what was coming would leave the group\'s only healer behind for the fights where she would be needed the most.*

*She might have been young, but she knew enough to wonder, even if she knew that a girl her age shouldn\'t have had to worry about something like that.*

*Today she had seen another magical girl team for the first time. The Mitakihara Three, they called themselves, though Oriko whispered to her by telepathy that they had been the Two until they had acquired a new girl, who they were meeting for the first time.*

*They had looked normal enough---more normal than the Southern Group ever looked, if Yuma was being honest with herself---but they seethed with hatred---hatred for everyone in the Southern Group, hatred for Oriko in particular, in a way that Yuma couldn\'t comprehend.*

*And the thing was, Yuma got the distinct impression that it was Oriko\'s *fault, not theirs.*

*And then there was what that one girl, Sakura Kyouko, had said:*

What\'s a new contractee like you doing with girls like these? I\'ll warn you right now: they\'re all insane. You\'re not going to live long, sticking with them.

*Though Yuma could certainly imagine being deceived, she couldn\'t bring herself to think the other girl was lying.*

*Well, at least she hadn\'t been forced to fight them. She wasn\'t sure if she could have.*

\"*I didn\'t think you\'d be the type of girl to hang around out here in the cold like this.*\"

*Yuma turned her head to look at the new arrival, Miroko Mikuru, who was standing on the peak of that section of the roof, just above her.*

*Yuma didn\'t really know what to say in response, so she turned back toward the city.*

\"*It\'s not that cold, I think,*\" *she said. What else was she supposed to say? That she couldn\'t sleep? That she was scared of this new life she apparently had?*

*Yuma thought she heard the other girl say something telepathically, and frowned, but before she could ask, Mikuru said: \"She doesn\'t really have it that bad,\" appearing next to Yuma. \"I\'ve undergone far worse. She\'s lucky.\"*

*Mikuru wasn\'t talking to her---she was talking to herself. Yuma wasn\'t sure if she was crazy, like Kirika was, but...*

*Why did someone like Oriko have a team full of girls like this? The other team, the Mitakihara Three, had seemed normal enough.*

*Mikuru shook her head, bangs waving slightly, as if to clear her head, and her eyes brightened, like she was coming out of some kind of trance.*

\"*Does the soul gem thing bother you?*\" *she asked, addressing Yuma directly.* \"*I have to say, it never bothered me. Having your soul in the gem is your source of power, and this world only respects power.*\"

*Yuma didn\'t know how to respond to that either, and a moment later Mikuru said---to herself:*

\"*She\'s also worried about the other group we met today. Well, it\'s all part of the plan. Oriko said...*\"

*Mikuru\'s voice trailed off, but the girl seemed incapable of staying silent without transmitting her thoughts by telepathy, and Yuma could hear Mikuru\'s telepathic murmuring continuing in the background, though she couldn\'t quite pick up what she was saying. Yuma had only been here a short while, but she had already realized that the reason Mikuru and her girlfriend were isolated in their own bedroom on the other side of the building was that Mikuru\'s constant telepathy was probably unbearable when trying to sleep. She had no idea how Aina dealt with it.*

\"*Why did you join Oriko‐nee‐chan?*\" *Yuma asked.* \"*She said you used to be on your own.*\"

*The telepathic murmuring stopped, and Mikuru smiled, face brightening again. The girl seemed to oscillate between two modes---one where she was relatively normal, and one where she was lost to the world, lost in her own thoughts. These modes came and went at the most inappropriate of times.*

\"*I\'ll tell you someday, when you\'re old enough to understand,*\" Mikuru said.* \"*Come on, you should go to bed.*\"

*The other girl wiggled her fingers at Yuma, and for a moment it felt like her face was freezing off, as unbearable cold bit into her cheek...*

\"*Alright, I get it,*\" *Yuma said, standing up to prepare for the jump back to her bedroom. In truth, she was glad to be given the excuse to leave. Mikuru seemed pleasant enough, at least when compared to Kure Kirika or Hinata Aina, but was still very weird to talk to.*

*Only as she landed back on the ground in the garden did she realize that she hadn\'t asked Mikuru why* she *was on the roof.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*What\'s it like to see the future, Onee‐chan?*\"

*The older girl glanced at her, looking for a moment away from the pair of magically‐enchanted binoculars she had spent the last fifteen minutes peering through intently.*

*A smile played at the older girl\'s lips, looking at her, and then the girl returned to her binoculars.*

\"*It is a terrible burden,*\" *she said.* \"*You must never envy me, Yuma‐chan. Being what I am, seeing what I see---it\'s like taking on the responsibilities of a god, without any of the power.*\"

\"*And what do you see?*\"

*The older girl glanced down at Yuma again. Yuma had gradually become increasingly impatient---nowadays, Oriko spent more time than ever on her farsight goggles, an enchanted apparatus whose gaze Hinata Aina claimed \"pierced cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh.\" Whether or not that was really true, it was definitely the case that Oriko saw many things through those goggles, which she used whenever she wanted to keep track of current events without having to rely on her exhausting future‐sight. Yuma had never gotten Oriko to admit where the goggles had come from, but she had gathered from the comments of the others that it was almost certainly loot from someone that they had... eliminated.*

*She still didn\'t know how to feel about that.*

\"*Would you like to see?*\" *the girl she thought of as her older sister asked.*

\"*Really?*\" *Yuma asked in surprise. Oriko guarded the goggles jealously, and never let anyone so much as touch them.*

\"*Really,*\" *Oriko said, handing the goggles to her.* \"*Take a look, but don\'t change any of the settings.*\"

*Yuma looked.*

\"*What do you see?*\"

\"*I see Kyouko‐chan and... a girl I don\'t recognize. They\'re fighting about something.*\"

\"*Miki Sayaka is her name. She\'s a new magical girl that has joined their team. They\'re fighting, you say?*\"

*Yuma squinted through the goggles, watching the two other girls push each other over what appeared to be a bag of groceries.*

\"*I don\'t think they\'re really fighting,*\" *Yuma said, finally. "*They\'re play‐fighting, like Aina‐san and Mikuru‐san do sometimes.*\"

\"*Very perceptive,*\" *Oriko said, taking the binoculars back. Yuma let her have them.*

\"*Are they a couple?*\"

*Oriko seemed to chew on her lip slightly.*

\"*They could be, but they won\'t be,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*Sakura Kyouko is too important.*\"

*Yuma frowned. Oriko had a habit of making mysterious statements like that. Important for what? She never said.*

\"*You\'re fond of Sakura‐san, aren\'t you?*\" *Oriko said, without taking her eyes away from the goggles.* \"*You called her Kyouko‐chan. You know she\'s supposed to be our enemy, right?*\"

*Yuma blushed slightly, digging one foot into the ground.*

\"*Well, that\'s, she doesn\'t seem---*\"

\"*Don\'t be embarrassed,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*I prefer it this way. Here, take another look.*\"

*This time Yuma saw only Kyouko, standing morosely at a street corner, kicking the ground. Where had Miki‐san gone?*

\"*Miki‐san is gone,*\" *she said.*

\"*Yes,* that *is the crucial dynamic,*\" *Oriko said, again taking the binoculars away from her.* \"*It is necessary to preserve it. I think it\'s time we attacked Sakura Kyouko.*\"

*Yuma cringed.*

\"*Attacked? But---*\"

\"*Don\'t worry, she\'ll live.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami frowned.

\"There was only one time that Kyouko was attacked alone, and it was Sayaka who showed up to save her,\" Mami said.

\"Yes,\" Yuma agreed. \"Well, so far as I know anyway, but it was Sayaka that came to save her. I snuck a peek in the goggles while the others were gone.\"

Mami shifted in her seat uncomfortably.

\"Not that I know for certain,\" she said. \"But I\'m pretty sure that incident helped make Kyouko, you know, think more highly of Sayaka.\"

\"Yes,\" Yuma agreed.

\"So Mikuni Oriko, who could see the future, tried to make it so Kyouko fell in love with Sayaka,\" MG said, stating bluntly what the other two had danced around. She still looked shaken, though less shaken than before.

\"Yes,\" Yuma said.

\"Why?\"

Yuma shrugged.

\"I only have theories. I don\'t really know.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Damn it all, what\'s so special about you?*\"

*Yuma braced herself for the blow to her face, which sent her flying across the room, giving her just enough time to realize she was about to crash into an ornamental wooden chair before she felt herself slam sideways into said furniture. The momentum of the kick sent both her body and the chair slamming into the wall, the wooden frame splintering and digging painfully into her arm.*

*She shut out the pain, a feat she found much easier now as a magical girl, and even had a moment to reflect that a kick like that would have almost certainly killed her, in her past life. Then again, she doubted her parents could have kicked that hard.*

*She got back on her feet only slowly, not because of pain or injury, but simply out of caution. It was safer if she didn\'t antagonize her assailant any further, which she might have if she had popped right back up. She might be a lot stronger now, but she knew better than to think she could take on any of the older girls in a fight. Age and experience was its own kind of strength---that was a lesson Yuma had learned back in school.*

*She looked up and found Hinata Aina standing right in her face, breathing fire---metaphorically, though the other girl could easily make the statement literal.*

*Yuma had just enough time to surreptitiously heal her wounds before the other girl picked her up by the front of her shirt, pulling her into the air so that they would look each other in the face, Yuma\'s feet dangling. The gesture was one of disrespect, but Yuma honestly preferred it to being forced to stare directly into the other girl\'s cleavage at close range. Hinata the Scarlet seemed to always feel the heat of the fire that powered her, and consequently could rarely keep more than a few pieces of clothing on her at a time. Yuma always got the distinct impression that if it weren\'t for the opinion of her girlfriend, "Aina‐chan\" would wander the mansion in nothing at all. They were all girls, after all.*

\"*Well?*\" *Aina demanded, glaring into Yuma\'s eyes.* \"*Oriko doesn\'t let* anyone *touch the farsight goggles. Why you? Why are you special?*\"

\"*I don\'t know!*\" *Yuma said, perfectly honestly.* \"*Maybe it\'s because... because I\'m a kid?*\"

\"*Not good enough,*\" *Aina growled, tightening her grip. Yuma wasn\'t sure if it was her imagination, but she had the sense that her chest was growing abnormally warm.*

\"*Huh, if I didn\'t know better, I\'d say you were jealous of her,*\" Mikuru said, appearing on the other side of the room, behind Aina\'s right shoulder.*

\"*I think she* is *jealous,*\" *Kure Kirika said, appearing behind Aina\'s other shoulder.*

*In a flash, Kirika reappeared directly next to Aina, grasping the arm Aina was using to hold Yuma up, her fingers pressing into the wrist.*

\"*Hands off,*\" *Kirika said.*

\"*Why do* you *care?*\" *Aina demanded acidly.* \"*You don\'t like her any more than I do.*\"

\"*Oriko made it my duty to defend her with my life, same as with Oriko herself. That\'s all I need to know. Hands...* Off!\"

*Kirika\'s fingernails started to visibly press into Aina\'s flesh and even grew just a bit longer, if Yuma\'s eyes didn\'t deceive her.*

*Finally, though she showed no evident signs of pain, Aina released her grip on Yuma, who dropped adroitly to the ground and landed on both her feet. This wasn\'t the first time she had been aggressively lifted off the ground by Hinata Aina, and she didn\'t expect it to be her last.*

\"*Leave her alone, Ai‐chan,*\" *Mikuru said.* \"*She obviously doesn\'t know anything.*\"

\"*We\'ll see about that,*\" *Aina said, looking at Yuma out of the corner of her eye.*

\"*Maybe Oriko just likes her,*\" *Mikuru suggested.*

\"*Like hell she does,*\" *Aina said, glaring at her girlfriend. "*That girl never does anything without a plan, and you know it.*\"

\"*Why do you care if she does favor Yuma‐chan, then? Obviously, there\'s a reason for it. I think you\'re jealous. Why are you being jealous about anyone but me?*\"

\"*I\'m* not *being jealous. You\'re the one being jealous, right now!*\"

\"*Oh, not this again---*\"

\"*Come on, let\'s get out of here,*\" *Kirika said, grabbing Yuma gently by the shoulder.* \"*They\'re going to start throwing things soon, then have a round of hate‐sex to make up for everything. I\'m tired of seeing it. I\'m just glad Oriko is rich enough to replace whatever they break.*\"

\"*Hate... sex?*\" *Yuma asked, repeating the unfamiliar phrase.*

\"*Don\'t worry about it. Come on, let\'s go.*\"

*Honestly, Yuma found the unfolding fight kind of refreshing. She was used enough to violence to not be too perturbed---she was pretty sure her mother loved her, too, and she still hit Yuma all the time. And whatever else was going on, Aina\'s presence did wonders for Mikuru\'s focus. In Aina\'s presence, Mikuru was far more consistently nice Mikuru, rather than the crazy Mikuru who talked to herself and ignored the world. Yuma was learning to like nice Mikuru, but crazy Mikuru scared her.*

*Despite that, she let Kirika pull her out of the way.*

\"*What did Aina‐chan mean when she said you don\'t like me?*\" *Yuma asked, as soon as they got out of earshot.*

*Without stopping, Kirika smiled in that incredibly unsettling way she had, the smile that seemed to imply she had sharp teeth like a wolf.*

\"*Let\'s just say love is infinite, and sometimes can be infinitely selfish,*\" *Kirika said.* \"*You\'ll understand when you\'re older.*\"

*Kirika\'s voice seemed friendly, but had enough sinister cadences that Yuma realized it was wise not to ask for any further details.*

*In the background she heard something shatter.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Wires ran to and fro across the work table, connecting several fully occupied power strips with a variety of small black boxes, large metal boxes, and what looked like giant glass bulbs, or maybe upside‐down beakers. An assortment of metal tools lay next to the motley assemblage---blades, wire cutters, pliers, tweezers, and even a soldering iron.*

*In short, it looked like the lab of a mad scientist, or the kind of scientist one would see on afternoon children\'s anime, except it didn\'t look like there were very many chemicals around, or any really. There were no mysterious bubbling fluids in glass vials to complete the picture.*

\"*What is it?*\" *Yuma asked, asking the natural question.*

\"*It\'s my lab,*\" *Oriko said, with a touch of pride.* \"*Or, at least, I like to call it my lab, which is probably saying a bit too much right now. This will be an important part of your education.*\"

*Yuma looked up at her* Onee‐chan. *Oriko\'s face showed no obvious sign that she was joking.*

\"*Really? Me? But what will I be learning?*\" *Yuma asked, looking around at the equipment in bewilderment.* \"*Is it science?*\"

\"*Sort of,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*I intend to have you help me with my research here.*\"

\"*Me?*\" *Yuma asked incredulously.* \"*But I don\'t know how to---I can\'t---what if I hurt myself?*\"

\"*Then you can heal it,*\" *Oriko said placidly.* \"*That\'s not to say I won\'t teach you about safety, but being a magical girl does have some benefits, after all.*\"

*Yuma waited for Oriko to say something further, but the girl didn\'t. Yuma looked around---at Oriko smiling and humming to herself, at the plain, almost drab white walls, and at the lack of decoration or windows in the room. The \"lab\" wasn\'t in a basement, but it might as well have been, and its empty interior stood in sharp contrast to the lavish decorations of the rest of the mansion.*

*It reminded Yuma a little of her old bedroom, actually.*

\"*Uh---*\" *Yuma began, trying to prompt Oriko into saying something.*

\"*Come with me,*\" *Oriko said, stepping forward abruptly towards the bench, gesturing at Yuma to follow.*

\"*Put your hand on this orb,*\" *Oriko said, once Yuma had done so.*

*Oriko put her hand onto the clear glass ball to demonstrate.*

*Yuma looked at it for a moment. It was about the size of her head and reminded her of something she had seen on a field trip to a science museum a long time ago. There had been lightning inside that one, though.*

*Yuma put her hand onto the glass, a bit hesitantly, following Oriko\'s example.*

\"*Do you feel anything?*\" *Oriko asked, smiling.*

*Yuma shook her head no.*

\"*Close your eyes,*\" *Oriko instructed.* \"*I don\'t want to know just how it feels through normal touch. I\'m looking for something* magical. Try to feel with your soul, the same way you can sense demons or other magical girls.*\"

*Yuma still felt rather confused, but did what Oriko said, closing her eyes and trying to reach outward with her magic sense. She could feel Oriko standing next to her, grief cubes somewhere in the room, and---*

*Yuma opened her eyes, scrunching her face.*

\"*I don\'t get it,*\" *she said.* \"*There\'s something magical in this orb.*\"

\"*Correct,*\" *Oriko said, smiling at Yuma.* \"*The glass itself is magically modified, enchanted in the same way my farsight goggles were. It\'s taken me months to develop the skills necessary, but I modified this one myself. Unfortunately, enchantment didn\'t come free with my magical talents, so it took a lot of work.*\"

*Yuma started to ask whether Oriko had also made the farsight goggles herself, but bit her tongue just in time. Nothing good would come of asking about that.*

*Instead she allowed Oriko to bask in the glow of her pride for a moment---and she was obviously proud, rubbing the glass orb as if it were an actual magician\'s orb, or perhaps a magic lamp.*

\"*What\'s it for?*\" *Yuma asked eventually.*

\"*We think of our magic as a unique entity, separate from technology and science,*\" *Oriko said, voice didactic.*

*She narrowed her eyes, seeming to peer into the orb, and Yuma leaned over to try to catch a glimpse of what was in there---but there was nothing there, and she realized that Oriko wasn\'t looking into the orb, only* at *the orb.*

\"*But it\'s obvious that it must be possible to connect magic with technology* somehow, *because the Incubators did it,*\" *Oriko continued.* \"*Obviously, they\'re not going tell us* how *they do it, but---*\"

\"*Have you tried asking?*\" *Yuma interrupted.*

\"*What?*\" *Oriko asked, looking at Yuma.*

\"*Why don\'t you try asking?*\" *Yuma said.* \"*Kyubey seems nice enough.*\"

*Oriko looked away from Yuma for a moment.*

\"*I* did *try asking,*\" *Oriko said, after a moment.* \"*He wouldn\'t say anything. And you should know that the Incubators are selfish creatures. They might act nice, but in the end they only really care about what\'s good for them.*\"

*Yuma frowned.*

\"*Really?*\"

\"*It doesn\'t matter,*\" *Oriko said, shaking her head.* \"*Anyway, the point is, while we don\'t exactly have the same level of technology they do, we have a natural advantage when it comes to trying to perform feats involving magic, which of course is that we can access magic directly. The hard part is managing the grief cube use. Spending all your time practicing doing something is* expensive. *In theory, though, there\'s an obvious connection between magic and energy, so it should be possible to enchant something to work on electricity rather than raw magic, like the farsight goggles. In theory.*\"

\"*What is it* for, *though?*\" *Yuma asked, exasperated by the circuitous explanation.* \"*What\'s the orb for?*\"

*Oriko looked at Yuma, then reached down to open a drawer below the workbench, pulling out... a small handful of grief cubes.*

*Yuma let out a small gasp.*

\"*I\'ve been working on a procedure to allow the packing of extra grief into individual grief cubes,*\" *Oriko said, opening a slot in the mounting of the orb.* \"*That way, it would be possible to extract more value out of individual grief cubes, and we could use a lot more magic without having to worry about grief cube costs. You can obviously see how that would be valuable, right?*\"

*Yuma nodded, looking up at with a sudden sense of awe. Even as new as she was, she could see that something like that would change everything. *If Oriko could manage that...*

\"*I\'ve already worked out how to do it with direct application of magic,*\" *Oriko said,* \"*but no matter how much I try, I can\'t figure out how to do it without spending considerably more magic than it\'s actually worth. What I* want *is to make a device that can do the same thing, but running on regular electricity rather than magic.*\"

*Yuma frowned, putting her hand back on the orb in front of her. She grasped the concept, but...*

*There was something...*

\"*If you can do something like that with electricity, why couldn\'t you do everything with electricity?*\" *Yuma asked, finally.*

*Oriko smiled broadly, on the verge of grinning.*

\"*That\'s an important point,*\" *she said.* \"*I\'ve thought about that, and there\'s no obvious reason why it couldn\'t be done, depending on what exact type of magic you were trying to replicate. Things like summoning objects or causing explosions would probably cost way more energy than you could ever draw out of a power outlet, but there are other things, like teleportation or mind‐reading, that don\'t intrinsically cost much energy, that might be doable.*\"

*Oriko ducked her head, seeming to think for a moment.*

\"*Energy?*\" *Yuma asked.* \"*Why would that be important?*\"

*She had heard about it before in school, but she didn\'t really understand it.*

*Oriko shook her head.*

\"*I\'ll explain it to you later. The point is, I thought it might not be too hard to perform grief concentration in energy terms, and there aren\'t many things I could do that would have more impact than this, but...*\"

\"*But?*\" *Yuma prompted.*

\"*It\'s not really working,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*And now I can think of some arguments for why it* shouldn\'t *work. I wish I could be sure it was that, though, and not just my lack of skill at enchanting. I wish I could just ask someone like Tomoe Mami, though obviously that\'s out of the question.*\"

*Oriko paused again for a moment, then said:*

\"*People like her bother me. All that talent, and she doesn\'t know where to point it. That\'s not her fault, though.*\"

\"*Do you hate her,* Onee‐chan?\" *Yuma asked.*

*Oriko gave Yuma a strange look, as if what she had said made no sense.*

\"*No, not really,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*Come on, let me give you a demonstration, even if it doesn\'t really work yet.*\"

*Oriko reached behind the orb, flipping a switch with a loud snap.*

*A door slid open at the bottom and the grief cubes she had placed earlier rose upward on a small tray, eventually stopping near the center of the orb. Peering inward, Yuma could see that the tray, far from being a simple flat surface, was an ornate golden metal, the sides frilled with golden leaves. The tray as a whole was suspended by a metal column engirdled by rows of symbols.*

\"*It\'s not possible to enchant something without the magic giving it a design like this,*\" *Oriko said, by way of explanation.* \"*I\'m not really sure why, but it probably has something to do with why all magical girls have costumes of one variety or another. Human magic seems determined to make itself aesthetically obvious, though I\'m not sure why the enchanted glass of this orb doesn\'t look very different. I suspect it\'s because orbs are already associated with magic and witches, so there wasn\'t very much to do.*\"

*Oriko flipped another switch, and the orb began to hum, a slight blue glow becoming visible at the base of the ornate column. The blue glow traveled upward, illuminating as it passed the symbols etched into the side of the column, filling the glass sphere with an eerie, pale light.*

*A long moment later, the glow reached the grief cube tray itself, which turned a bright, blinding white, the grief cubes themselves transforming from their usual pitch‐black state into luminescent white cubes.*

*No, not just bright white cubes. Yuma squinted---if she fought the eye‐burning glare, she almost thought she could peer into the cubes themselves, that she could see some hint of structure, some hint---*

*The glare vanished, the tray and cubes blotted out by an impossibly black ooze, or perhaps cloud, that had appeared in the center of the orb. Similar to the usual state of grief cubes, this black blight reflected no light, not even the trace emissions that would have enabled Yuma to discern how it was spreading, or what its three‐dimensional shape was like. Indeed, it almost looked like the corruption was absorbing more light than what should have been possible, that it was somehow preventing Yuma from seeing even the light reflecting off of the glass directly in front of it.*

*Overall, the effect was as if someone had taken a black sharpie and started to blot out part of the universe itself, and Yuma started to feel a creeping sense of insecurity over whether the corruption was really contained within the orb.*

*The lights in the room flickered, casting the two of them into a moment of complete darkness that caused Yuma to jump and yelp in surprise.*

*A loud zapping noise followed immediately afterward, a cloud of acrid smoke wafting outward from the orb and burning Yuma\'s nostrils. Both the glow and oozing blackness were gone, and by all appearances the tray of grief cubes was back to normal, except for a few black scorch marks that had appeared on the edge and were already fading away.*

\"*And that\'s what always happens,*\" *Oriko said, coughing and using her hand to wave away the smoke.* \"*I can get it to start the procedure, but then it* always *fails. I don\'t even know why it does what it does. It\'s definitely a work in progress.*\"

\"*You want me to work on* this?\" *Yuma asked, making no effort to hide the incredulity in her voice. She was flattered that Oriko felt her capable of something like that at her age, but she had the distinct sense that she would be biting off a lot more than she could chew.*

\"*You\'re not going to have a normal life when you grow up, Yuma‐chan,*\" *Oriko said, bending down to look Yuma in the eyes. "*None of us will. The only thing you can be is a professional magical girl, and that means mastering magic. First I will teach you how to manipulate grief cubes, then you can help me with my work.*\"

*Yuma shook her head.*

\"*I\'m not going to grow up,*\" *she said.* \"*No one lives that long. Kirika‐san said so.*\"

*A trace of annoyance passed over Oriko\'s face.*

\"*It\'s not true that no one lives that long,*\" *Oriko said, expression dark for a moment.* \"*It\'s just extremely rare. You shouldn\'t worry about something like that.*\"

\"*Anyway, let\'s go,*\" *Oriko said, grabbing Yuma by the hand. "*You\'ve seen all you need to here. We have other work to do.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Ah, so that\'s why you know so much about this kind of thing,\" MG said. \"Well, that, and your tenure as head of MSY Science Division.\"

\"This is *why* I was head of Science Division,\" Yuma said. \"I knew more on the topic than anyone living, except maybe Clarisse van Rossum. I wish I could say it was only esoteric knowledge, but I ended up using it far too much.\"

\"I\'d rather not hear about it,\" Mami said, drinking deeply from her cup of virtual tea, which she had made bottomless.

\"I\'m not going to tell you,\" Yuma responded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*What does it mean to fall in love?*\"

*Miroko Mikuru looked down at the younger girl, surprise evident on her face. The older girl probably hadn\'t expected a question like that after she had agreed to take Yuma to the grocery store, but on the way out of the mansion Yuma had seen Aina give her a rather open display of affection, so the question was fresh on her mind.*

*Yuma\'s question also helped interrupt the flow of Mikuru\'s telepathic mumblings, which Yuma had gradually learned to tolerate. It wasn\'t as bad once you got used to it and, to Yuma, it seemed like Mikuru was fundamentally a nice girl underneath the layer of... possible insanity that lay on top. Also important for this particular trip was that Mikuru seemed capable of suppressing her audible, vocalized mumblings when out in public, restricting it to only telepathy.*

*Mikuru reached up with one hand---the one not holding Yuma\'s hand---and scratched her cheek nervously, one of those little behavioral tics that Yuma had realized still distinguished her as not more than sixteen years old.*

\"*That\'s a hard question,*\" *Mikuru said.* \"*Ordinarily, I\'d tell you to wait until you\'re older, but... well, you\'re getting close to old enough.*\"

*She looked up at the sky for a moment.*

\"*I sound so old saying that, and I\'m not really that old,*\" *she said.* \"*If I wanted to be fully honest with you, I\'m not sure Aina and I are really in love. It feels like it, but we\'re also so young, and it rarely works like it does in the movies for anyone our age.*\"

*She looked back down.*

\"*But life is short, especially our lives. So, why not?*\"

\"*You\'re not answering the question!*\" *Yuma insisted.*

*Mikuru smiled a little.*

\"*Well, you\'re a smart girl, yes. It\'s not an easy question. I would say being in love is just realizing that you can\'t stand to be without someone, that you want to spend all your time with them, that you would lay down your life for them. Something like that. I don\'t think I\'m experienced enough to say more than that. It\'s like... how I try to be around more, when Aina is around. Pay more attention to the world.*\"

*It was the first time Yuma had ever heard Mikuru reference her own condition, even if indirectly. Yuma thought about asking her about it, but asked instead:*

\"*What about sex then? What does that have to do with it?*\"

*Mikuru visibly grimaced, then glanced around nervously for anyone who might be listening in.*

\"*It\'s a part of it,*\" *Mikuru said.* \"*It\'s something you only do with someone you love. It\'s a show of intimacy, I guess.*\"

*Yuma looked down for a moment, remembering Hinata Aina. If that was true, then why had... what had she been...*

*Yet under Mikuru\'s concerned look, Yuma sensed that it was not a question she could ask.*

\"*You\'re not old enough yet, okay?*\" *Mikuru said, patting Yuma on the shoulder.* \"*Remember that. Don\'t...*\"

*Mikuru paused for a long moment, before finishing:*

\"*Don\'t let anyone try to get you started early, okay? That\'s not right. That\'s what made me what I am, and no one else should have to go through that. You tell me if anyone bullies you like that, and I\'ll take care of it for you.*\"

*Mikuru\'s eyes were intense, her gaze seeming to bore into Yuma\'s heart.*

*Yuma couldn\'t withstand the look, and had to break the eye contact, and look down at the cement sidewalk.*

Mikuru‐san was used by some gangs to make money, for a long time after her parents died, *Yuma remembered Oriko saying.* Her wish was for revenge, and I helped her get that revenge. And I felt good doing it. For your sake, I wouldn\'t ask for more detail than that. Someday, you\'ll understand.

*\"Okay,\" Yuma said quietly.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"That\'s horrible,\" MG said, with the kind of absolute revulsion Governance AIs reserved only for a Core Right violations. It was one thing that set AIs apart from organic humans: a set of absolute, unbreakable morals. If there was an equivalent to an AI religion or ideology, the Volokhov Criterion was it, written indelibly into their software.

Yuma couldn\'t help but find something a little disquieting in that, though of course AIs themselves never saw anything wrong with it.

\"*There\'s a reason I kept these kinds of things secret from you,*\" Yuma thought to MG, directly over their internal channel. \"*It\'s not the kind of thing a young AI should hear about.*\"

\"*Thanks,* Mom,\" MG responded sarcastically. \"*Aren\'t you the one who always says we should know evil to fight it?*\"

Yuma sipped her coffee to conceal her unease. That kind of line she always found biting; what exactly was it that she saw MG as? Was it indeed daughter? Did she see MG as a young version of herself, someone to protect from the ravages of the world until it was safe? Someone to live the life she had never had?

She peered into the ripples of her coffee, and wondered if she regretted what she had become.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Yuma‐chan! Are you okay?*\"

*Yuma lay inside the pile of rubble, using her body and magic to brace herself, and to keep herself from being crushed by the collapsed ceiling. Honestly, it wasn\'t even that difficult---she was fine. She was mostly just bothered by the darkness and dust.*

*Yuma found herself impressed by the resilience of the magical girl body. If it weren\'t for the fact that she could hear Mikuru\'s voice calling to her from above, she would already be working herself out of the wreckage.*

*A moment later the plaster and wood immediately above her turned a light shade of blue, a thick sheet of magical ice layering itself over their surfaces. Yuma sucked in a breath---she had seen this trick before.*

*Then, with the deafening sound of a hundred chandeliers shattering, the world above her exploded in a rain of supercooled shards, the sunlight pouring in on her. By rights, the countless shards of frozen wood and construction material should have fallen down upon her, killing her body by a thousand cuts---but of course Kirika had more control than that over her blows, coming as they did while she slowed time. In fact, raining ice shards down upon the enemy---while leaving their own allies unharmed---was one of the group\'s favorite combat tricks.*

*Yuma preferred not to wonder if it was ever used against anything other than demons.*

\"*I told you something like this wouldn\'t kill her,*\" *Kirika said, reaching down to give her a hand up. She was smiling that unsettlingly sharp smile of hers, but this time with no hint of malice.*

\"*Worst case she would just heal herself,*\" *Aina commented.*

\"*I have the right to be worried,*\" *Mikuru said.*

\"*What happened?*\" *Oriko asked, looking Yuma in the eyes.*

*It was easy to think that Oriko was omniscient, but Yuma had come to realize that this was far from true. Oriko could only see the future, and* only *those parts of the future she chose to focus her attention on. The past, and even the present, was a sealed mystery to her, which was more inconvenient than one would think.*

*Yuma shook her head to get out the debris that had settled in her hair.*

\"*I was trying to experiment with one of those overloaded grief cubes like you said,*\" *she said.* \"*I wanted to see if I could use one of your special wires to run grief directly into one of them. But...*\"

\"*But?*\" *Oriko prompted, raising an eyebrow.*

\"*It exploded,*\" *Yuma said.* \"*Well, not exploded, but the black stuff came out everywhere, and then there were demons. They almost killed me. I was barely able to kill them, but I, uh---*\"

*She found herself at a loss, rubbing the back of her head in embarrassment. She didn\'t know how to say it.*

\"*Hold on, a demon exploded from the grief cube? I\'ve never seen* that happen,*\" *Kirika said.*

\"*It can, if you leave one unattended and don\'t pay attention it,*\" Mikuru said.* \"*It\'s rare though. I\'ve never seen it myself. It\'s just what... I\'ve heard said.*\"

\"*But how did that lead to the room collapsing?*\" *Oriko asked, getting efficiently to the point.* \"*What happens in the miasma stays in the miasma.*\"

*Yuma grimaced.*

\"*Well, I, uh, got a little carried away swinging my hammer. I slammed my hammer into the ground after the miasma ended and it, uh, brought down the ceiling. It wasn\'t my fault! I was scared!*\"

\"*It\'s okay,*\" *Oriko reassured hastily, appearing in front of Yuma. "*Don\'t worry about it. I\'m rich enough that it doesn\'t matter. What\'s important is that you\'re safe.*\"

*Oriko reached down to pick Yuma up---a maneuver that would have been only barely possible if either of them were human. They met gazes, and Yuma thought Oriko looked oddly probing, as if looking at Yuma for something.*

\"*I\'d expect someone of her age to be more panicked after what happened to her,*\" *Mikuru commented.*

\"*Eh, she looks like a girl who can take punishment,*\" *Kirika rebutted.*

\"*We shouldn\'t dawdle,*\" *Oriko said, setting Yuma back down and looking at the others.* \"*If it\'s really true that these overloaded grief cubes can spawn demons, then there\'s an entire set of them buried under these ruins, and we have to dig them out unless we want them to spawn while we\'re sleeping.*\"

*Kirika shrugged.*

\"*That only really happened because she was messing with one using magic. That doesn\'t mean it can just* happen.\"

\"*Though it does mean they might be usable as some kind of bombs,*\" Aina said thoughtfully.*

\"*Better not to risk it,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*It\'s not worth---*\"

*As if on cue, the telltale signs of a miasma began to appear around them, the world beginning to turn misty and blurred. Yuma sensed in her soul the stirring of the demons around them, ominous and hungry.*

\"*Well, it looks like it\'s party time then!*\" *Aina said.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Strange as it seemed, Yuma didn\'t think she liked ice cream anymore.*

*It wasn\'t that it tasted any different; it was still the same overstimulating combination of sugar and fats it always had been, and the sensation of it melting in her mouth was unchanged, as craftily unctuous as ever.*

*But it just didn\'t flatter her anymore, and she found herself sitting on a bench outside the ice cream shop, staring blankly at a freshly purchased chocolate cone.*

*She felt guilty. She doubted this was what Oriko had intended when she had shooed Yuma out the door with a fistful of yen and a list of supplies to buy, as well as the directive to enjoy herself with whatever money was left. As it had turned out, there was a lot of money left over, and Yuma had come to understand that this was intended as a bit of a day off for her.*

*Yuma wasn\'t really sure about the wisdom of letting someone of her age wander the city on her own, but Yuma supposed she was more than capable of taking on any kidnappers that might be coming her way. The bigger risk was the other magical girls of the city, but Yuma knew enough to stay within the Southern Group\'s territory and keep her soul gem emissions minimized. Besides, Oriko would know if she were about to run into trouble.*

*Not to mention, Yuma found it considerably more pleasant to be alone than to be with any other member of her group, bar Oriko herself. Mikuru might have been okay, though her constant telepathic self‐talk would have been grating---but Yuma had no urge whatsoever to spend time with Kirika or Aina, quality or otherwise.*

*She took another, halting bite of her ice cream, trying to let the sugar soothe her soul as it once always had.*

*She could tell already that it wasn\'t working, though, and she felt sad, as if she had lost something irreplaceable.*

\"*Hmm, I didn\'t expect to see* you *here,*\" *said an unfamiliar female voice as Yuma felt someone seat herself on the bench next to her, sighing loudly.*

*Yuma looked up at the newly arrived teenager with short hair and athletic appearance. The girl, who seemed oddly familiar, looked back at her.*

*For a moment Yuma found herself at a loss, wondering what the girl had meant by \"you\".*

*Then Yuma finally placed why it was that the girl was familiar, and barely avoided dropping her ice cream cone, hand shaking. Miki Sayaka? Here? But this was---*

\"*---Southern Group territory, right?*\" *Sayaka said, finishing a sentence Yuma hadn\'t heard.* \"*Yeah, I know. I came here looking for someone to fight, tracked down a soul gem, and found you. It\'s surprising, to be honest; the others aren\'t even sure you\'re still alive.*\"

\"*You--you want to fight?*\" *Yuma said, realizing she was doing a terrible job of keeping fear out of her voice. Her eyes were already busy scanning the pedestrians on the street across from them. Surely she wouldn\'t get attacked in public?*

\"*Well, I did,*\" *Sayaka said, shaking her head almost sadly,* \"*but not really anymore, to be honest. It\'s just as well I found you; you\'re the one Kyouko says we shouldn\'t hurt, and I can see why: you\'re just a kid.*\"

*Yuma felt relieved, a little, but continued to scan the area around her. Now that she was paying attention, she could sense Sayaka\'s soul gem pulsating nearby, but still couldn\'t feel anyone else in the area. Was Sayaka here alone?*

\"*You didn\'t look like you\'re liking that ice cream very much,*\" Sayaka commented.*

\"*I can\'t enjoy it anymore, not after what happened,*\" *Yuma said, shaking her head, saying it out loud before realizing she shouldn\'t have.*

\"*I definitely know what you mean,*\" *the other girl said, smiling crookedly.*

*She looked up at the sky.*

\"*It just takes the flavor out of life when you learn the world just isn\'t the way it should be, and there\'s nothing you can do to change it,*\" *Sayaka said.*

*She looked down at her hands.*

\"*I came here because I thought I could at least do the world a service by eliminating some evil, but I can\'t even find the evil properly. I really am pointless.*\"

*Yuma tilted her head, trying to understand what the girl was getting at. Something about the way she was talking reminded her of one of her own teammates, though she couldn\'t really identify* what.

*Sayaka shook her head morosely, then seemed to focus back on the moment.*

\"*I wonder what could have happened to a kid like you, though, for you to say something like that.*\"

*Yuma shrugged, choosing not to answer the question. By this point she had started to relax a little. It was still possible that this girl\'s geniality was just a cover to get her off‐guard, or that she would spontaneously go crazy and attack her---Yuma certainly spent enough time with crazy people to know that it was not impossible.*

*She didn\'t really think so, though. Something about this girl seemed... too sad for that.*

*Sayaka shrugged back at Yuma\'s lack of response, then said:*

\"*Your ice cream is melting. You don\'t have to eat it if you don\'t want to. Let\'s go have some dinner. I\'ll pay for it, since you\'re a kid after all.*\"

\"*Dinner?*\" *Yuma repeated emptily. Of all the things she might have been expecting, she had not even considered that a girl from an opposing team of magical girls would try to invite her to have food.*

\"*Yeah,*\" *the other girl said, watching Yuma with an expression that was somehow simultaneously serious and playful.* \"*I don\'t want to go back yet, and I\'ve got nothing better to do. As long as you can promise the rest of your team won\'t come to kill me.*\"

*Yuma made a hapless expression she hoped adequately conveyed that she had literally no control over the rest of the Southern Group.*

*Sayaka chuckled.*

\"*Don\'t worry about it.*\"

*The girl jumped off the bench, standing and stretching up towards the afternoon sky. She seemed a bit happier.*

\"*There\'s a ramen place nearby,*\" *she said.* \"*Not as good as the place in Kazamino, but good enough. I know there\'s no reason for you to trust me, but there\'s also no way I could kill you in front of like thirty people. What do you say?*\"

*Yuma knew that she should say no, that even if Sayaka did nothing to her, getting caught might make the others think her a traitor, and finally that if nothing else, she shouldn\'t be following strangers anywhere---*

*---but she found that, at the moment, she didn\'t care. She was tired of being locked into Oriko\'s mansion, having to meet the same tired circle of Kirika and Aina and Mikuru over and over and* over. *She wanted to talk to someone else for once.*

*She stepped off the bench and made what she thought was an acceptably blithe shrug.*

*Her eyes caught on someone in the distance.*

Who is that---

\"*Is something wrong?*\" *Sayaka asked, turning to look at the same spot. The person had moved, though.*

\"*It\'s nothing,*\" *Yuma said.* \"*Come on.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Let me tell you something, Yuma‐chan,*\" *Sayaka said, pointing at her with one hand.* \"*Never fall in love.*\"

*Yuma, who had been focused on slurping down her ramen as fast as possible, felt her eyes widen at Sayaka\'s statement. Up until that point in the meal, conversation had consisted primarily of long silences, interspersed with vague rants from Sayaka about how annoying Kyouko was, or how she hated that her parents were never around, or various other topics that were of exactly zero relevance to Yuma. Yuma was smart enough to know when she was being used as a sounding board, and had simply nodded along without saying a single word.*

*True to form, Yuma merely tilted her head, indicating for Sayaka to continue. There was nothing Yuma could really say since she had no experience with it herself, unless she wanted to talk about the rest of the Southern Group, which she didn\'t.*

\"*All falling in love does is make you crazy, and make the people around you crazy, and it doesn\'t help anyone in the end,*\" *Sayaka said, pointing at her now with a fork.* \"*Don\'t do it.*\"

*The other girl hung her head downward, and Yuma got the distinct impression she would be drinking sake if she could legally get her hands on some.*

\"*I thought I could be different,*\" *Sayaka said,* \"*but in the end I\'m the same as everyone else.*\"

*Yuma thought about Mikuru and Aina, and about Oriko and Kirika. They were mostly crazy, and at least* claimed *to be in love, so Sayaka\'s claim seemed at least possible. Yuma got the distinct impression Sayaka wasn\'t just making the statement off the cuff---that what she was saying had to be relevant to something.*

\"*What happened?*\" *she asked.*

*Sayaka turned to look at her, her expression difficult to read. Yuma had definitely hit some kind of nerve, but it was difficult to tell whether the other girl was bemused, angry, or depressed. It almost seemed like the other girl was trying hard to keep her facial expressions rigidly still---a phenomenon Yuma recognized from the carefully‐controlled expression Mikuru wore when in public.*

\"*I\'d rather not say,*\" *Sayaka said, turning back towards her bowl of ramen.*

\"*Why?*\"

*Sayaka bent her head downward, slurping her noodles loudly, and the possibility finally occurred to Yuma that she was being too assertively curious. She should have known better: while it was a trait that Oriko encouraged, it was also one that her parents had definitely... not encouraged.*

*She was starting to lose some of the habits that she had been forced to have back when she lived with her parents. If nothing else, living with Oriko had improved her life* that *much.*

\"*It would sound stupid if I said it out loud,*\" *Sayaka said, finally, forcing herself to smile slightly.* \"*I know it\'s selfish, but I\'m curious about what happened to you, to become a---*\"

*Sayaka\'s eyes slid sideways, towards the other patrons of the restaurant.*

\"*---to become one of us,*\" *Sayaka finished.* \"*It\'s just curiosity, so you don\'t have to tell me if you don\'t want to, but maybe after it I will want to tell you about me.*\"

*Yuma put one finger to her cheek to think, a habit she had picked up from her mother. She couldn\'t think of any reason* not *to say what happened, and maybe afterward Sayaka would think better of Oriko and the others, and maybe then they would fight less, and get less gruesome injuries that Yuma would have to help heal. She was... starting to get a little too used to the sight of blood, she thought.*

*So she drank the last of her ramen broth, and told the other girl her story, a story she hadn\'t even told Oriko in its entirety yet---Oriko had never asked---and she saw Sayaka\'s eyes widen several times and her brow grow increasingly furrowed. Several times, Sayaka signaled her aggressively with her hands to keep her voice down, or to stop speaking entirely as a waiter passed by. Yuma wondered just what was so bad about what she was saying.*

\"*And the next day I woke up in Oriko\'s house,*\" *Yuma finished, hesitating before mentioning Oriko\'s name.* \"*She was the white girl who saved me.*\"

\"*I\'ll be honest, it\'s kind of hard to imagine her doing something like that,*\" *Sayaka said, a constricted expression on her face. "*But I guess even she has to have a conscience sometimes. And from what Kyouko has told me, I can\'t be surprised Mikuru killed that dirty thug.*\"

*Yuma recoiled in shock, not at Sayaka\'s tone of disgust, or the aspersions cast at Oriko, but at Sayaka\'s assertion that Mikuru had killed Tanaka‐san. Strange as it was to say, even though she remembered that part quite clearly, Yuma had yet to make the obvious connections between a blue icicle spear and the ice mage.*

I guess I just haven\'t wanted to think about it, *Yuma thought.*

\"*So you wished Oriko back together after the demons cut her up?*\" Sayaka said.* \"*That\'s surprising: I didn\'t think someone like her could even get injured.*\"

\"*I don\'t remember that day very well,*\" *Yuma said,* \"*but yes, that\'s what happened.*\"

*Sayaka looked down, at her now empty ramen bowl, and Yuma could tell that Sayaka was again concealing her expression. What was she thinking?*

\"*I was kind of wondering...*\" *Yuma began hesitantly.*

*Sayaka looked up, and Yuma sucked in a breath, trying to be very careful with her next words.*

\"*Why exactly do you all hate us so much?*\" *she asked.* \"*Oriko doesn\'t let me go out much, so I don\'t really... know, I guess?*\"

*Sayaka looked back into her empty bowl, and Yuma could feel the other girl\'s dark mood radiating out.*

\"*I used to be sure,*\" *she said.* \"*But now I\'m not so sure. If Oriko can save a girl like you, and I can do what I did, then what makes...*\"

*Sayaka shook her head, seeming disappointed in something.*

\"*Well, let me tell you what happened to Mami.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Just because Oriko saved you doesn\'t mean she wasn\'t evil,\" Mami said, still compulsively sipping her tea. \"We\'ve been over this.\"

\"I already know what you think of Oriko,\" Yuma said, a trace annoyed. "The focus here is on Sayaka.\"

\"Yes, about her,\" Mami began, setting her teacup back down into its saucer dramatically.

\"You never told us you ever met her,\" Mami said, \"but I can see why you didn\'t. There\'s nothing here that\'s that unusual. If Sayaka was having doubts about her purpose in life... well, we knew that already, even if we realized it way too late.\"

Yuma closed her eyes, bowing her head slightly.

\"Let me finish the story,\" she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The two of them separated at the doorway to the restaurant under the flickering light of the streetlamps. It was already nearly dark---far later than Yuma knew she should have stayed out alone. But as a magical girl, jumping between the rooftops---that was different, almost a different world entirely from the mundane world that filled the streets below.*

*A block away from the restaurant, Yuma got tired of that mundane world and prepared to transform so that she could traverse the rooftops and reach home much faster. There seemed to be no one around to see her.*

\"*Hey, kid.*\"

*Yuma stopped, immediately glad that she hadn\'t transformed as she had planned to. But where was the man\'s voice coming from?*

*She turned around, and felt her blood freeze.*

\"*Hello there, little girl,*\" *one of the two men said, advancing on her.* \"*I just thought we\'d have a little chat.*\"

*Yuma recognized them immediately, of course; they had accompanied Tanaka when he had arrived to threaten her parents and beat up her father.*

*Yuma heard an involuntary whimper emit from her own throat.*

\"*Now normally I\'d be a little more polite to a girl like you, but I don\'t think there\'s any need for pretense here,*\" *the taller one said, cracking his knuckles.*

*He grabbed her by the collar and picked her up.*

\"*Now a funny thing happened recently,*\" *he said.* \"*Our good friend Tanaka‐san was found dead, with a hole in his stomach. Your parents have gone missing, and you went missing, too, so it\'s lucky that we found you so that we can clarify matters, isn\'t that right?*\"

*His partner nodded.*

\"*Your parents are going to pay for what they did to Tanaka‐san, and it starts with* you,\" *he said.* \"*Doesn\'t that sound fun?*\"

*Yuma felt the chilly fear freezing her heart, but still did not transform, trapped between the need to escape and the rules against giving away the secret.*

\"*Don\'t be so mean to her,*\" *the taller man said.* \"*If we just sweet‐talk her a little, we can be friends. Kids like her are easy to trick; I even got one of the kids back at the boss\'s place to think she loves me!*\"

*They both laughed, villainous laughs that seemed almost like caricatures, except it was all too real. Yuma felt her grip tighten on the arm of the man holding her, and she began to realize how easily she could just... break it in half.*

\"*Hey, scumbags!*\" *Sayaka yelled, appearing abruptly a few meters down the sidewalk. She was fully transformed, sword pointed forward in both hands, and Yuma could suddenly feel the power radiating from her.*

*The two men turned, entirely disregarding Yuma for the moment, though the taller one kept his grip on Yuma\'s collar.*

\"*What\'s this, then?*\" *he said, still laughing.* \"*Little miss cosplay thinks she\'s going to do something? Put down that plastic sword and---*\"

*His voice cut off with a horrifying gurgle, and his grip on Yuma relaxed. Yuma landed on the ground with her usual adroitness---in a pool of already gathering blood.*

*She recoiled in horror.*

\"*You know,*\" *Sayaka said as the man\'s partner stumbled backward in mortified terror,* \"*I set out today to die fighting a villain, to give some meaning to my life. I haven\'t found the villains I was looking for, or the meaning, but I found* you.\"

*She pulled her sword gradually out of the taller man\'s still writhing body, releasing ever more blood as she went. The taller man grasped at the blade in pure agony---*

*---and then fell to the ground with a thud, and he stopped moving, the copious blood soaking into his suit.*

*His partner grasped frantically inside his jacket, finally finding and whipping out a small handgun, pointing it at Sayaka.*

\"*You--you---*\" *he began.*

*His head fell to the floor a moment later; his body didn\'t immediately follow.*

*Yuma put her hands to her mouth in horror. These men hadn\'t been her friends, *obviously, but---*

*Sayaka turned her head, and her eyes met with Yuma\'s for just a split‐second. The front of Sayaka\'s armor was covered in blood.*

\"*You\'re crazy,*\" *Yuma said, voice shaking.*

*And then she saw the other girl\'s soul gem, on her belly, seething with despair, the dark shadow that seemed to blot out the universe itself.*

*Sayaka opened her mouth to say something, but instead turned her head away and* ran.

*It only took her a moment to disappear from Yuma\'s sight.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This time Mami didn\'t sip her tea, instead holding the cup in a hand that shook, ever so slightly.

\"So *that\'s* what happened, that one time she disappeared,\" Mami said, looking more shocked than Yuma had seen her in a long time. \"She never told us. She never told anyone. Not that I blame her, but---\"

Mami leaned one arm onto the table, using it as a desperate physical support.

\"Oh, Miki‐san, where did I go wrong?\" Mami said. \"Why didn\'t you say* anything? We could have...\"

Mami\'s voice trailed off as she stared at the table, clearly reliving the memories. Next to her, MG sat ashen‐faced, watching Yuma with a horrified expression.

\"She\'s the one that ended up dying, right?\" she said. \"Disappeared and all that. I won\'t argue they didn\'t deserve what happened to them, but to just *kill* them like that...\"

Yuma shook her head.

\"It\'s not something you\'re really made to understand,\" Yuma said, more coolly than she\'d intended. \"You AIs are coded to be more robust than that. Like humans, you have a range of base happiness levels, and some of you are prone to sadness and depression, but the kind of thing Miki Sayaka underwent isn\'t intended to be possible. Be glad for that.\"

Yuma saw MG lower her head to hide her expression and felt a pang of guilt.

She tried to shake it off, saying:

\"Well, anyway, Mami, it wasn\'t your fault at all...\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Oh my, it really sounds like things have come to a head,*\" *Oriko said, dispelling a blotch of blood from Yuma\'s shirt with a brief burst of magic.*

\"*I don\'t understand why you have to do that for her,*\" *Kirika said, watching the two of them with what looked like annoyance.* \"*I could easily teach her how to clean up some blood herself.*\"

\"*We both know you have plenty of experience, Kirika,*\" *Oriko said, rubbing Yuma\'s hair with one hand.* \"*But the fact is, I don\'t intend Yuma here to get her hands bloody. It shouldn\'t be a skill she\'d need.*\"

*Yuma just stood there in silence, not really listening to what the others were talking about.*

*She didn\'t know why it bothered her so much, what had happened to those two men, but all she could see at the moment was a man lying dead in a pool of blood, and the hopeless eyes of another man as his life force drained away. There was no reason to hope, after all---no one could ever survive decapitation.*

*She had picked up the man\'s head and looked into his eyes, heedless of the blood that stained her clothes.*

*Then she had healed him, because she didn\'t know what else to do, leaving the now‐intact man blinking in confusion, lying there in the street. She had used a lot of magic in the effort.*

*The rest was a blur---stumbling down the street mindlessly, untransformed, until the shocked gasps of pedestrians forced her onto the rooftops. She wondered what it was she had looked like.*

\"*You think she\'ll be okay?*\" *Kirika said, with a soft tone Yuma had never heard from the girl.* \"*With the way you coddle her, there\'s no way---*\"

\"*She\'ll be fine,*\" *Oriko said decisively, placing her palm to Yuma\'s forehead.*

*She thought she saw something glow for a moment, but then she felt her mood lifting, and what had happened seemed to fade away, off into the depths of her memory.*

*What had she been thinking about?*

\"*If you say so,*\" *Kirika said, looking bothered by something.*

*Oriko gave Kirika a look, and Kirika nodded, turning to leave the room.*

*Yuma looked up at Oriko, who peered back into her eyes unsettlingly.*

\"*I need you to make some more of those overfilled grief cubes,*\" Oriko said.*

\"*Why?*\" *Yuma asked.* \"*They\'re dangerous.*\"

\"*They have their uses,*\" *Oriko said.*

*Somehow, Yuma didn\'t feel like contesting the topic, and simply nodded. She would do what it took to please* onee‐sama, *after all.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Eating dinner at Oriko\'s mansion was always a bit of an odd affair. Oriko always insisted that they all eat together, but the mixture of personalities at their table was combustible at best.*

*It went without saying that Oriko cooked all of their meals, though the others often volunteered or were roped into helping. The only exception was on those days---increasingly frequent---where Oriko simply didn\'t have time, and they instead had their meals catered by one of the local restaurants.*

*Oddly enough, given how much wealth she seemed to have, Oriko simply didn\'t have any servants. While that did make keeping up the magical girl secret simpler, it seemed very unusual. Yuma had never asked, though.*

*Oriko wasn\'t there that day, however, leaving the other four girls to eat their gourmet Italian food in exuberant silence---well, leaving aside Mikuru\'s occasional self‐comments, which they were all used to now.*

\"*Where exactly is she anyway?*\" *Mikuru asked finally, awkwardly poking at her pasta with chopsticks.* \"*I don\'t like how she just goes out like this without telling us where she\'s going. She could be doing anything.*\"

\"*Who cares?*\" *Aina said.*

*She took a moment to sip directly out of a bowl of soup before setting it back down and continuing:*

\"*She knows what she\'s about, and she\'s the one with the spooky future vision. Don\'t be so suspicious. We\'ve been through too much for her to just stab us in the back.*\"

\"*I didn\'t expect to hear* that *from you,*\" *Mikuru said. "*You\'re the one who\'s always paranoid about everything. Weren\'t you the one who said that uh---new girl---Akemi Homura must be some kind of super‐magical girl or slider or something?*\"

\"*I\'m just saying there\'s something weird about her,*\" *Aina said, working on some roast chicken with a knife.* \"*Angel wings, ridiculous powers, and a personality like* that? *She\'s not run‐of‐the‐mill, at least, and I bet her wish wasn\'t either.*\"

\"*I\'m not going to argue that she isn\'t unusual, but that doesn\'t mean she\'s what you say she is,*\" *Mikuru said.* \"*The real world doesn\'t work like that. We all have reasons we made the wishes we did, but you just don\'t see any particularly special magical girls around. I almost suspect the Incubators don\'t grant wishes that would give you too much power.*\"

*There was a brief moment of silence, then, as Aina bit into a piece of chicken. That was the obvious reason she wasn\'t speaking, but Yuma got the impression that wasn\'t the* real *reason.*

*Yuma bit her lip, though, remembering that the last time she had tried to ask Aina about anything she had gotten lifted up into the air again. It was not something she enjoyed.*

\"*You can be skeptical if you want, but there\'s something going on here,*\" *Aina said.* \"*Or haven\'t you noticed that we\'re following an oracle to fulfill some mysterious plan that involves some kind of angel girl and---*\"

*Aina cast an open glance at Yuma.*

\"*---some rather ordinary‐looking children.*\"

\"*I\'d just* appreciate *it if Oriko‐san would share some of her plans with us,*\" *Mikuru said.* \"*Look, I\'m thankful she did what she did for us, and for giving us this nice place to live. I know we owe her. But keeping us in the dark like this just... makes it seem like she thinks we wouldn\'t like what she would tell us, that\'s all. I\'d prefer some reassurance.*\"

*As she spoke, Mikuru made a point of trying to accentuate her phrasing by aggressively using her chopsticks to eat the pasta. It didn\'t look very impressive to Yuma---she would have been better off if she were eating meat, like Aina was.*

\"*Don\'t tell me you\'re jealous of her,*\" *Aina said, cutting into her own meat with a much more impressive gesture.*

\"*Jealous? Of what? The way you think she\'s some kind of prophet? No. I\'m not.*\"

*Mikuru bit into some more of her pasta, giving up on any more elaborate gestures.*

\"*The way I see it,*\" *she continued.* \"*We\'re all a little crazy, so you\'re entitled to your craziness.*\"

\"*Well the way* I *see it,*\" *Aina said without missing a beat,* \"*is that we\'re all going to be dead soon enough anyway, so I might as well try to follow what I can, just in case there\'s something to it.*\"

\"*The both of you* shut up,\" *Kirika said, banging the dark oak table with both fists.* \"*I am* tired *of hearing you two chit‐chat inanely, especially questioning Oriko. She has only the best in mind for us.*\"

*Kirika glared around at the others to see if they would challenge her. Aina sneered, but said nothing. Mikuru ignored Kirika, pointedly focusing on her food.*

\"*For. Your. Information,*\" *Kirika said, accentuating each word for emphasis,* \"*our esteemed oracle is attending a violin concert, to blow off some steam. That\'s it.*\"

\"*On her own?*\" *Aina said, eating a piece of dessert fruit with a haughty gesture.* \"*That\'s not safe. She\'s yelled at me for less than that.*\"

\"*Well, she would know if it\'s safe,*\" *Kirika said.*

\"*Violin concert?*\" *Mikuru asked.* \"*I have to ask: What performance? I didn\'t think she was a fan.*\"

*Kirika leaned back against her chair, her anger dissipating like a summer shower before the wind.*

\"*Well, I didn\'t think so either, but there\'s some local prodigy playing.* Ave Maria *or something like that. I can\'t tell you more than that. To be honest, I\'m a little bummed she\'s not taking me with her, but I can understand if she needs her space.*\"

*Kirika didn\'t sound like she believed her own reassurance, but neither Aina nor Mikuru chose to needle her on it. Yuma wondered why.*

\"*Did any of you ever learn to play any instruments?*\" *Yuma asked, on impulse. She had always vaguely wanted to play some music, but her parents were clearly never going to support that.*

*All three of the others turned to look at her, but not angrily---more as if she had suddenly sprouted a second head.*

\"*Never mind,*\" *Yuma squeaked. Why did she say things like that?*

*They ate the rest of their dinner in silence.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*It had been nearly a month since Oriko had last asked Yuma to go on patrol and to be frank, she was a little excited. She missed a little the rush of combat, and the carelessness with which she could smash everything around her with her hammer. It stood in stark contrast to the way she lived her usual life, a monotony of fiddling with grief cubes, book lessons from Oriko, and carefully stepping around the toes of the other girls.*

*She wasn\'t surprised, though, when instead of demons, her small three‐person party---herself, Aina, and Mikuru---ran into members of the Mitakihara Three. Oriko\'s trademark was her ability to foresee the future, and Yuma was gradually learning that in her vicinity very little of importance happened by accident, whether it be having ramen with murderous magical girls or chance encounters while out on patrol.*

*They found Tomoe Mami and Akemi Homura exiting, of all things, a flower shop, the older girl holding in front of her a bouquet of blue flowers three times the size of her head.*

*Following Aina\'s cue, the three of them landed in a nearby alleyway, stepping out in front of the other two girls. There were far too many pedestrians in the area to have a confrontation, but it was necessary to show that they had noticed the other girls.*

*However, even if they were in public, there was no rule that they had to pretend to like each other.*

\"*This is neutral borderland,*\" *Mami said, looking over the other three with a strained expression, as if she could barely stand the situation.* \"*I know you types don\'t really respect that kind of thing, but we are within rights to be here.*\"

*Hinata Aina smiled unsettlingly.*

\"*We\'re not here to kill you today. We\'re just here to observe. Although...*\"

*She looked at Homura, and Yuma followed the gaze, stopping on Homura\'s intense expression, which she abruptly realized was focused on Yuma herself. Homura seemed to be... watching her for something.*

*She was the same girl Yuma had seen before, obviously---and yet she wasn\'t, not with that brooding look and burning intensity. Something was different about the girl Aina thought had angelic traits. What had happened to her?*

*Yuma could see that Aina was having thoughts along the same lines, but rather than ask a question that wouldn\'t be answered, Aina said:*

\"*You know, since we have your attention, I have to ask...*\"

*She batted her hair insouciantly, a gesture Yuma knew she did to annoy people.*

\"*What exactly happened to Miki Sayaka? Our sources tell us that she\'s gone missing, and that\'s a real shame---*\"

*A moment later Aina found herself blinking down the barrel of one of Mami\'s ornate muskets, which the untransformed girl had somehow managed to summon and swing directly into Aina\'s face so quickly none of the others had managed to react.*

*Aina managed to stay impressively unfazed.*

\"*Put that away,*\" *Mikuru said coldly.* \"*We\'re in a public location.*\"

\"*For your* information,\" *Mami growled,* \"*she died fighting off a massive horde of demons from a violin concert, and deserves your respect. Not that* you *would know anything about heroism.*\"

\"*Just like you know nothing about keeping your* kouhai *alive?*\" Aina retorted, ignoring the gun barrel in her face.*

*A spasm of rage passed over Mami\'s face, and for a moment Yuma was actually afraid she would fire, but then the new Homura grabbed Mami\'s arm and forced it downward.*

\"*It\'s not worth it,*\" *Homura said.*

\"*And what\'s with you?*\" *Aina began.*

\"*Violin concert?*\" *Yuma interrupted, blurting out the question. "*Ave Maria?*\"

\"*Actually, yes,*\" *Homura said, looking at Yuma with a newly inquisitive expression, as Mami continued to try to pull her arm out of Homura\'s grasp.*

\"*Have you heard about it?*\" *Homura asked a moment later.*

*Yuma squeezed her eyes shut, feeling a tremendous headache coming on. She remembered putting grief cubes in a machine, activating the machines, giving the contents to Oriko---*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"That *bitch!*\" Mami said, slamming her teacup and saucer off the table and into one of the virtual pedestrians, who recoiled momentarily before the simulation erased the event, returning the pedestrians to normal with a shimmer.

\"Four hundred years, and I\'m still learning new reasons to hate her!\" Mami said, barely stopping herself from yelling, though she gesticulated wildly with one arm, trademark hair bouncing. \"What next? Am I going to learn that the war was her fault? Or that she caused Homura to leave?\"

\"Calm down, Mami‐san,\" MG said, cringing away from the normally sedate Mami. \"This was centuries ago.\"

Mami regained control of herself with a very visible effort, bracing herself against the metal table and swallowing dramatically, before falling back into her seat.

Her cup of tea reappeared, and she picked it up, chugging rather than sipping at the drink.

\"To think that Oriko was behind what happened to Sayaka,\" Mami said finally, shaking her head. \"I always knew there was something fishy about that demon spawn.\"

\"Not just Oriko,\" Yuma said. \"I was the one who made the cubes she used as weapons.\"

\"She didn\'t tell you what they were for,\" MG said.

\"I could have easily deduced she was attacking someone,\" Yuma said. "Or I could have asked, at the very least.\"

\"She obviously performed some kind of mental manipulation on you,\" Mami said, sipping her tea more calmly---though she was drinking a *lot of tea. \"It\'s not your fault at all.\"

\"Did she though?\" Yuma said. \"I\'ve had many years to think about what happened, and I\'m not fully convinced. She clearly lifted my mood, but think of all the times we\'ve used a mood‐lifting spell on our teams. There\'s no evidence she did anything more than that. At very least, I don\'t think she would have been able to control me if I hadn\'t wanted to be controlled. It left me feeling guilty for a long time.\"

Mami shook her head.

\"Mind manipulation or not, you were only nine,\" Mami said. \"Oriko is the one at fault. I\'m not going to hold you responsible for what happened then, just like I don\'t hold you responsible for what happened to the Southern Group later.\"

Yuma sighed.

\"You might not, but I\'m not sure I can say the same. What really matters is what Kyouko thinks.\"

Mami\'s eyes widened, apparently not having thought of the topic from that angle, even though it was part of the justification Yuma had given for even bringing the topic up.

\"Kyouko has always blamed herself for what happened to Sayaka,\" Yuma continued. \"She thinks she could have stopped it, that she should have done something different... but Oriko had it in for her all along. If it was Oriko that wanted Sayaka to destroy herself, there was probably nothing Kyouko could do.\"

\"I\'m not sure I buy that,\" Mami commented.

\"It gives her another way to think about it,\" Yuma said. \"I\'ve wanted to tell her for a long, long time, but each year that passes makes it harder to drag up history this old, especially since...\"

Yuma closed her eyes for a moment, letting the end of her sentence trail off.

\"Especially since I don\'t know how she will take the fact that I was involved,\" she said. \"That\'s why I never brought it up in the first place, all those years ago.\"

She picked up the café au lait in front of her, then set it back down again. She still didn\'t feel like drinking any of it.

\"But the thing is, we all have our obsessions,\" she continued, \"and hers is what happened to Sayaka. You\'ve read the reports as much as I have. Her inability to let go is starting to hurt her. We need to push her out of her rut, for better or worse.\"

Mami shook her head.

\"I\'m still not sure I agree.\"

\"Think about it. For now, I should finish the story, for MG\'s sake.\"

MG grimaced.

\"I\'m not sure I want to hear it. The past sounds like a terrible, horrible place.\"

Yuma could have pointed out that it was MG who always got mad at her for keeping secrets from her, but bit down that easy, puerile rejoinder. It was MG\'s prerogative to be unreasonable to Yuma sometimes, but Yuma couldn\'t do the same. Not given their relationship.

\"Yeah, and we had to live there,\" Mami said, holding her tea pensively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*To say that Oriko and the others rarely entertained guests would have been a drastic understatement. In the entire time that Yuma had spent at the mansion, she had not once seen anyone other than the five members of their group cross the iron gates that barred passage inward. Postman and delivery boy alike were obliged to drop off their parcels at the gate, or else to wait for one of the girls to come grab the goods. According to Mikuru, the local legend was that Oriko\'s mansion was being used for a secret government project, or else haunted, depending on who you asked. Oriko preferred it that way---it was truly a walled garden.*

*Yet here in the tea garden Oriko sat, entertaining the mysterious foreign magical girl from---well, somewhere in Europe; Yuma was guessing Germany. Somehow Yuma had been allowed to sit with the two of them as long as she stayed quiet, and she spent the time openly staring at the newcomer, with her sprinkling of freckles and shock of unusually wavy hair.*

*She was a magical girl, and she had said her name was Clarisse van Rossum. Instead of challenging the intrusion into their territory, or even questioning who the girl was, Oriko had laid out the figurative red carpet, telling the others that Clarisse was* special.

*And so she was. To hear her tell it, in stilted Japanese, she was some kind of wandering magical girl, obligated by her wish to travel the world, and was just over a century old. To Yuma, who hadn\'t realized it was even possible for a magical girl to leave the city, it sounded romantic and wondrous---and also possibly made up, especially the part where she claimed to be a hundred years old.*

*Oriko took in the story unquestioningly, though, and if Oriko believed it, how could Yuma say she knew any better?*

\"*So you\'re just passing by?*\" *Oriko asked, dabbling her cake into some honey poured out onto her plate.*

\"*A little,*\" *Clarisse said, her use of the language shaky.* \"*I don\'t understand, but something here in this city is very, very important. I haven\'t figured out what it is, but it might be something to do with uh, the girls, farther down---*\"

\"*Akemi Homura?*\" *Oriko asked, pouring her guest a new cup of tea.*

\"*Oh yes, I should have just said the name,*\" *Clarisse said.* \"*Her. But I still don\'t really understand it.*\"

\"*That\'s very interesting,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*I---*\"

*Yuma didn\'t catch the rest of Oriko\'s sentence, however, as the new girl\'s voice boomed in her head.*

I have a message for you, little one, *Clarisse thought, and Yuma understood what she was saying perfectly, even though the thought was rendered in---well, Yuma didn\'t even know what language it was.*

Message? *Yuma thought, glancing back and forth repeatedly between Clarisse and Oriko, both of whom seemed perfectly oblivious to the telepathic communication, though of course Clarisse could not be.*

Yes, a message, that I was told to relay to you, though I do not quite understand it myself.

A message from whom? *Yuma thought, managing to still herself and pretend to focus on eating the croissant in front of her.*

I can\'t say. It\'s a simple message, though. It says, you should know that despite your youth, you can do a lot more than you think to change the world. More than that, I\'m supposed to remind you that Oriko doesn\'t really see everything---she only sees what she tries to see.

Are you trying to turn me against her? *Yuma asked, feeling a sense of rage rising within her.*

No, it is only advice about your life and your surroundings, *Clarisse said, outwardly sipping at her tea.*

Who are you? *Yuma asked.*

\"*I guess you could say I\'m the ghost of history,*\" *Clarisse said, out loud, apparently a continuation of her conversation with Oriko.*

\"*Well, then I\'m the ghost of the future,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*What is this,* A Christmas Carol?\"

*Clarisse laughed.*

*Oriko looked down at her tea for a moment, looking briefly thoughtful. Not just the usual kind of thoughtful either, such as when choosing what to make for dinner---this was a lot deeper, more* vulnerable.

*In that moment, Yuma was struck by how much younger Oriko looked than the other girl, and for a moment Clarisse\'s unbelievable assertions about her lifespan seemed almost plausible.*

\"*I might as well take the opportunity to ask someone more experienced...*\" *Oriko began.*

*Clarisse tilted her head slightly, inviting Oriko to ask her question.*

\"*It feels like a silly question,*\" *Oriko prevaricated,* \"*and I\'m not sure if in your short time meeting Akemi‐san you noticed, but she has some rather interesting beliefs.*\"

\"*That there is a Goddess of magical girls who watches over us all and runs some kind of afterlife?*\" *Clarisse asked efficiently, casually drinking more tea.*

*Oriko was visibly relieved she didn\'t have to explain. Yuma, though, scrunched her face in perplexity---Goddess? Afterlife? What were they talking about?*

\"*Yes,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*It sounds silly of me to say, but the idea has troubled me for a while now. I know you are particularly long‐lived, but most of us have only short lives to look forward to. I just wanted to know if, after your long life, you think even a part of it is possible. We are* magical, *and I think I speak for all of us when I say I\'d like there to be some meaning to my life other than what I make of it.*\"

*Clarisse smiled cryptically.*

\"*If it reassures you, I can say that I don\'t think it impossible at all. I\'ve seen enough in my life to make me believe that there\'s something deeper to all this than just what the Incubators tell us. But if the Goddess Akemi Homura believes in really exists, I wish she\'d give me more clues as to what I\'m supposed to be doing here.*\"

*Oriko closed her eyes for a moment, then reached for a pastry.*

\"*I think I would like that as well,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*You would think that someone like me who can see the future would be more certain of the meaning of fate, but if anything I\'m more uncertain than anyone.*\"

\"*Hmm,*\" *Clarisse said, chewing on a croissant.*

Another message, *Clarisse thought to Yuma.* This time from me, because I\'m not without insight of my own, and I feel sorry for you. I\'m sure you\'ve noticed by now that there\'s a lot more to your Southern Group than is obvious. The past month has been eventful for you, though I don\'t think things will stay that way. I want you to know that you\'re a lot stronger than you think you are, and not to lose hope. Hope is, after all, what makes a magical girl. Just keep your eyes open, and don\'t be scared to ask questions.

*Yuma blinked, taking in the rapid‐fire message. She hadn\'t known it was possible to* think *a message so quickly.*

\"*Honestly, I\'m not surprised,*\" *Clarisse said.* \"*Sometimes I feel as if more knowledge just makes you more aware of how much you don\'t know. That\'s been a lot of my experience, anyway.*\"

*Oriko looked up abruptly, glancing over the table.*

\"*Yuma‐chan, we seem to be almost out of pastries,*\" *she said.* \"*Be a dear and go grab some, okay?*\"

*Yuma nodded, hiding her reluctance as she dropped out of her chair. She didn\'t want to leave what seemed like an important conversation, but if there was one thing magical girls were, they were gluttons, completely free of the limitations of body shape, caloric intake, or even stomach capacity---Kirika and Aina were probably the shining examples of this, though she had seen Oriko imbibe shocking amounts of fine chocolate on more than one occasion.*

\"*It is natural for every magical girl to wonder about their impact on the world,*\" *she heard Clarisse say as she walked away.* \"*I can\'t give much assurance on that, though I think most of us would settle for just being remembered...*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"The way Clarisse talks almost makes it seem like she might have known what happened to Sayaka,\" Mami said, frowning. \"Do you know if she does?\"

Yuma shook her head.

\"I\'ve never asked, and even if I did, do you really think she\'d tell me? She doesn\'t talk about the secrets she knows. In fact, I bet you never knew she ever met Oriko.\"

Mami made a face as if she had just bitten into something unpleasant.

\"No, I didn\'t, and it sticks in my craw a little that the two of them talked so pleasantly. Would it really hurt for her to a little more open about the past? It\'s been so long.\"

\"I would guess that she has plenty of skeletons in the closet, same as all of us,\" Yuma said.

\"I suppose,\" Mami answered, reluctantly dropping the topic.

She stirred her tea.

\"I\'m still surprised Clarisse has fallen in with Kyouko\'s Cult nonsense,\" she said, finally.

\"Clarisse has always been different from the rest of us, even the Ancients,\" Yuma said placidly, finally taking a sip of her coffee. \"I can understand why she would want to seek meaning in her long life.\"

\"And you?\" Mami asked.

Yuma looked at Mami with one eye. It was an unusually direct question for Mami, but the girl looked only inquisitive; Yuma sensed no ulterior motives in the body language, for whatever that was worth in a simulation.

\"Oriko never believed in anything like that, even though I know she wanted to,\" Yuma said. \"That\'s good enough for me.\"

She saw Mami frown, knowing she had displeased her with the vaguely positive reference to Oriko.

Mami was wrong, of course. Clarisse couldn\'t talk about the past, no matter how long ago it was. There was no better example of that than Mami herself, who still held her grudge against Oriko four and a half centuries later. Some things were just better not spoken about.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Clarisse had been right; things calmed down considerably after the first month.*

*Once Yuma got used to the rhythms of living with the Southern Group---how not to step on anyone\'s toes, how to avoid negative encounters with Aina, and how to exploit Mikuru and Oriko\'s relative friendliness---things became a lot less hectic. Life settled into a dull monotony of eating, sleeping, and working on Oriko\'s eccentric magical projects and assigned reading.*

*There were no insane girls inviting her to dinner, no contact with the other magical girl team of the city, no dubious century‐old guests---indeed, Yuma barely stepped outside at all, save for an occasional demon hunt to keep her skills sharp.*

*Yuma was okay with that, really. She had seen what the opposite of monotony was, and it involved getting to watch a man struggling for life in front of her, and learning that* onee‐sama *was a murderer.*

*She much preferred the monotony.*

*Nowadays, she spent much of her time working on Oriko\'s assignments. She didn\'t really understand what Oriko was trying to teach her with her alleged home‐schooling, which was clearly radically different from what she would have gotten in a normal school. The lessons cycled through a selection of Machiavelli and Sun Tzu, Economic Theory, Mathematics, and English.*

*In addition to being eccentric, Yuma perceived that she was being held to extremely high standards, and no amount of flattery from Oriko about how she was a prodigy made the struggle with the material any more pleasant.*

*Oriko, though, had a trick...*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Yuma stared up at Oriko\'s face, feeling restless. According to Oriko, a supine posture was best for certain kinds of magical procedures, so Yuma was lying face up on top of her bedsheets, observing features of Oriko\'s face and the ceiling above her.*

\"*Are you* sure *this is safe?*\" *Yuma asked, peering up at the older girl skeptically.*

*Oriko smiled back down at her indulgently, though her face betrayed a little surprise. Up until then, Yuma had repeatedly questioned instead whether it would* work, *and Oriko had always responded with something along the lines of:*

\"*Well, in principle modifying the brain shouldn\'t be any different than modifying any other body part, which isn\'t really all that different from healing, when you get down to it. Of course, you\'re naturally talented at healing, but learning to do anything else will take some careful focus.*\"

*The response was consistent enough that Yuma was now capable of quoting it nearly verbatim, though she didn\'t really think it answered the question. Suffice to say, Oriko behaved as if she was confident that it would work, once she trained Yuma in the right kind of magical application.*

*Whether it was* safe, *though...*

\"*I wouldn\'t be confident it was safe, except that I\'ve already spent the power to view this part of the future,*\" *Oriko said, eyes softening for a moment.* \"*It is safe.*\"

*Yuma blinked. The answer was certainly definitive, but it also confirmed that Yuma\'s concerns were, in fact, completely reasonable.*

\"*Alright, remember what you\'re supposed to do and close your eyes,*\" Oriko said.* \"*I can apply a small magical effect to help you concentrate, but modifying your own body is entirely a matter of your own willpower.*\"

*That was easy for her to say, but Yuma remained skeptical, even if she had earlier that week managed to grow her hair and shorten her fingernails by the exact same technique. It just... didn\'t seem comparable enough.*

*Still, she closed her eyes, allowing the influence of Oriko\'s magic to wash over her, smoothing away the doubts and skepticism she had about all of this. When it came to magic, Oriko was fond of saying, believing was as good as seeing, and Yuma settled in, trying to ingrain onto her soul gem a new vision of herself: a child prodigy, one with the attention span to read thick, ponderous books, capable of churning through arcane formulas in a textbook, and capable of writing spectacular computer programs. She imagined herself getting on‐stage and giving a lecture to an audience, working in front of a chalkboard, and mixing chemicals in a lab coat.*

*It was all rather silly, of course, but Oriko had instructed Yuma to visualize everything that meant \"smart\" to her, and Yuma could not allow herself to realize it was silly. She needed to desire it, to imagine it with all sincerity, to immerse herself in the idea so much that she was on the verge of believing it to be true.*

*Do that, Oriko said, and her soul gem itself would do the rest, updating her body to be what she now believed herself to be. Her personality, her memories, her* soul---*those were untouchable, but the rest was much more malleable.*

*Oriko\'s magic could wipe away some of the doubts, but she still had to want it, and Yuma found herself struggling with that more than anything.*

Stupid kid, *her father had said.*

Don\'t you understand anything? *her mother had said.*

What makes you think you know anything about what you\'re talking about? Aina had sneered.*

*She let the anger fill her, let it help her imagine the look on her dead parents\' faces when she achieved her potential, and imagined the sense of satisfaction she would get, when she finally proved Aina wrong, when she finally---*

*Yuma\'s eyes snapped open, as Oriko grabbed her shoulders and shook softly but resolutely. Yuma peered at Oriko in confusion.*

\"*Sorry, that\'s my fault,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*I think I might have overdone the effect a little. How do you feel? Do you feel any different?*\"

*Yuma thought about the question, then looked around at her arms and legs, even though that made no sense. How exactly was she supposed to check? Unlike having longer hair, the effects would not be obvious.*

*Oriko picked up Yuma\'s hands, peering intently at the ring on one of her fingers. Yuma followed the gaze, and for a moment it seemed to glow, though she couldn\'t tell for certain.*

\"*I don\'t think it worked,*\" *Yuma said.*

*Instead of responding, Oriko handed her an open textbook.*

\"*Read,*\" *she instructed.* \"*To yourself, it doesn\'t have to be out loud.*\"

*Yuma read, her own voice ringing didactic in her head:*

> A metric space is a generalization of normal Euclidean space to an arbitrary set of objects. Such a space *M* must consist of a set of objects X and a distance metric *d: X x X→ℝ* defined for any two objects in the set, such that the following properties hold:
>
> 1.  d(x,y)=0 ⇔ x=y
>
> 2.  d(x,y)=d(y,x)
>
> 3.  d(x,z)≤d(x,y)+d(y,z Triangle Inequality\]

*She wrinkled her nose at the unfamiliar terminology, wondering why she was reading this of all things.*

\"*It seems reasonable enough,*\" *she said.* \"*That\'s what you\'d expect out of a distance.*\"

\"*You read that pretty quickly,*\" *Oriko said.*

*Yuma shrugged.*

*Oriko smiled.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"You let Oriko mess with your brain?\" Mami asked, aghast.

\"I was ten!\" Yuma defended. \"Besides, it\'s not like she was the one doing anything to it. That was my own power. You know how this kind of thing works.\"

\"I do,\" Mami said, \"but heaven only knows what she could have done when she was \'helping your concentration.\'\"

\"She had plenty of chances other than that if she were going to try to do something sneaky,\" Yuma said. \"There\'s no reason to be worried about this in particular.\"

\"Let me make sure I understand this correctly,\" MG said, interrupting the small argument. \"You modified yourself to have greater intelligence, with Mikuni Oriko\'s help?\"

\"Pretty much,\" Yuma said, looking over at her AI protégé. \"As long as you avoid changing anything to do with personality, it\'s well within our capabilities. Indeed, this kind of thing is fairly common for our covert researchers and operatives, such as when they need to learn a new language.\"

\"It doesn\'t seem that weird to me,\" MG said. \"We modify our capabilities all the time. What\'s weird is how incapable most humans are of the same. It makes you more like us.\"

Yuma saw Mami glance at the AI. It wasn\'t the kind of comment Mami would appreciate.

She looked down for a moment. There was a conversation she needed to have with Mami, about her TacComp of all things, but she didn\'t relish it.

\"As I recall, you were the one who introduced the general technique,\" Mami said, clasping her hands in front of her mouth and peering at the other girl. \"You said you\'d developed it yourself.\"

\"A white lie,\" Yuma said, shrugging.

Mami shook her head in dismay.

\"Until today, I would have said that the four of us were past that kind of secret‐keeping,\" Mami said, looking down. \"I don\'t blame you, but it just bothers me. The only good thing about this war is that we can finally be more open about things.\"

Yuma bit back a sharp retort, acknowledging that Mami had refused to blame her.

She hoped, though, that Mami perceived the inconsistency in her own position, on the one hand wanting them not to keep secrets, and on the other doubting whether Yuma should tell Kyouko about what Oriko had done to Sayaka.

Yuma closed her eyes for a moment.

\"I have to disagree. I don\'t think the world will ever stop giving us secrets that we must keep,\" Yuma said, couching her words carefully. "At the very least there\'s plenty of information that would help our enemies if revealed. And before you say we don\'t have any enemies---\"

\"Yes, yes, what almost happened to Kyouko,\" Mami said impatiently. \"I try to be idealistic, not naïve.\"

There was a moment of silence at the table, as they each focused on their own thoughts.

\"Did you ever reverse the changes you made with Oriko?\" Mami asked finally. \"Are you still... you know?\"

\"You mean go back to being the way I was before?\" Yuma asked.

She shook her head.

\"No. Once you experience that kind of thing, you can\'t go back. Whatever else you want to say about Oriko, she gave me a pretty good education. I would have lost all of that if I tried to reverse anything. You can\'t really believe that I can hold my position right now with a body like this without some heavy modification? Even with the implants.\"

\"I *did* believe that,\" Mami said, \"and even then, what about when you weren\'t in this child\'s body? Did you reverse the changes then?\"

\"No, I didn\'t,\" Yuma said.

Mami shook her head again, muttered something to herself, then drank her tea compulsively.

Mami had always been a bit of a conservative, Yuma thought. This kind of brain modification was still highly secret in the MSY, precisely because its revelation to the magical girl public at large would cause a firestorm of controversy.

There were... many things like that. Things that Mami reminded her too much of.

That, too, was a conversation Yuma didn\'t relish having.

> On the magical side of things, Dr. Arnisaut is a world leader in understanding the miasma, one of the most mysterious aspects of the system we all live in. Deceivingly simple, demon miasmas are in fact a complex, ever‐changing magical entity in their own right. It is well‐known that miasmas trap their mundane victims in what appears to be a vast desert, but the exact interaction of the miasma with the real world is a subject of deep inquiry.
>
> The miasma appears to exist almost as a form of dream world---attached to our own, and yet not---capable of removing mundane humans from the real world into the dream world, and perfectly replicating the real world environment within the confines of the miasma. To the magical girl, the miasma seems visually indistinguishable from the real world, and may be entered and exited freely, but there are clear signs it is not quite the same, manifesting in a number of magical properties that are unique to the miasma. These include the granting of flight‐like abilities to magical girls within, the negation of collateral damage to buildings, and so forth.

The shared hallucination theory has difficulty explaining why it is that telepaths generally do not perceive any mental influence, and why it is that soul gem depletion from combat corresponds exactly with the amount of magic used in the "hallucination\". The pocket universe theory has difficulty with the "leak\" of mundane collateral damage out into the real world.
>
> It is Dr. Arnisaut\'s belief that both explanations are insufficient, and that a shared explanation is necessary, formed within the more complex Dream World hypothesis, grounded in the theory that rather than being the creation or tool of the demons, the miasma is a neutral entity, serving as an arbiter of combat that, among other things, helps protect the mundane human population that ultimately feeds all magic from being unnecessarily damaged.
>
> Highlights of past research in the lab include the demonstration that mundane volunteers in the miasma experience a brain state strongly reminiscent of REM sleep, and that the ability of demons to freely ignore seemingly solid barriers, as well as their general ghostly abilities, stem from existing partially in the \"desert\" world experienced by mundanes. The use of mundane volunteers to construct clever \"walls\" in the desert world from objects in their clothing demonstrated that demons show substantial reluctance to pass directly through solid objects in the desert world. This unexpected result showed that the desert world was not merely a pure illusion, as had once been thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*It was many long months, nearly a year, before Yuma dared ask Oriko the question that had gnawed at her.*

*After the incident with Sayaka, Oriko had not asked her for any more doctored grief cubes, and Yuma had studiously avoided making any possible reference to them. The old apparatus sat gathering dust on the table, unloved, except for those rare occasions when Yuma sidled up to it and checked whether the magically active parts of it were still active---they always were, and Yuma wondered how long an enchantment like that would eventually last, and whether the physical structure of those parts would eventually begin to deteriorate. Their style of magic was capable,* ipso facto, *of suspending entropy, but it always required a power source. Without it, how could the metal and plastic keep from feeling the wear of time?*

*Yuma spent much of her time now thinking about questions like that, her mindscape now capable of fathoming the concept of entropy, of taking the entities of the material world and organizing them into clear, logical chains.*

*Though she avoided thinking about grief cubes, she meditated---often literally---on other topics of interest, ranging from how Akemi Homura and Tomoe Mami managed to reduce their grief cube consumption to why magical constructs formed in battle seemed real to the touch but disappeared once the magical girl shifted focus. None of it made sense from an energy conservation standpoint---magical girls seemed stuck between one world where energy barely mattered, and one where energy was* everything, *and grief cubes had to be obsessively counted and recounted.*

*Where was it all coming from?*

*Her newfound ability to think more lucidly---one she occasionally made stabs at enhancing even further---carried costs, though. She found her thoughts drawn inevitably to her own situation, to her past, and to Oriko. There were conclusions she would rather not have drawn, domains where she would rather have stayed innocent.*

*It all came to a head, partially at least, when Oriko stopped by the basement lab to run the grief cube modification apparatus for the first time since the incident.*

\"*What do you need modified grief cubes for?*\" *she heard herself ask, though she knew she didn\'t really want to know.*

\"*I need to study the demons they produce,*\" *Oriko said, without looking away from the machine.* \"*I have a theory---*\"

\"*Who are you going to kill this time?*\" *Yuma asked, horrified the moment the words came out of her mouth. She hadn\'t meant to ask, not really, but it was almost as if she couldn\'t stand not knowing anymore.*

*She expected Oriko to freeze, or to glare at her, or to make a shocked expression, but she did none of that. Instead, Oriko turned her head towards Yuma, and straightened her back smoothly, and Yuma knew then that Oriko had foreseen the conversation, with the fearsome power under which Mitakihara---and Yuma---trembled.*

\"*You\'re not a child anymore, Yuma‐chan,*\" *Oriko said, eyes peering unerringly into Yuma\'s soul.* \"*Not after the change. You know that the world is more than just black and white. You know that sometimes to make omelettes, eggs must break. Sayaka was an egg.*\"

\"*And what is the omelette?*\" *Yuma asked, surprised she could still speak, even if she had to swallow in fear first.*

*Oriko smiled slightly, horribly.*

\"*It would ruin the dish to tell you. Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I have some modified grief cubes to make.*\"

*Swallowing again, Yuma stepped backward, nodding, feeling her hands tremble as she clasped them behind her back.*

*A moment later she fled headlong from the room.*

I\'m supposed to remind you that Oriko doesn\'t really see everything---she only sees what she tries to see, *Clarisse had said.*

*Yuma wondered if Oriko had seen Yuma sabotage the machine months ago, using her magic to age a key wire to failure. Easy enough to fix with a trip to the hardware store, but would Oriko have thought to look?*

*Was Clarisse right?*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Another few months brought another visitor, this time not an exotic magical girl who claimed to be unimaginably old, but merely a seemingly prosaic local, a short, unassuming‐looking girl named Kuroi Kana.*

*Unlike Clarisse, it was clear she wasn\'t here entirely of her own free will, even if Oriko had seated the three of them under the same veranda, with the same selection of high‐end pastries and drinks. It was chilly this time though because the season was different, and unlike Clarisse, Kana refused to touch any of the refreshments.*

\"*Please relax a little, Kuroi‐san,*\" *Oriko said, sipping elegantly at a small cup of espresso.* \"*This isn\'t intended as a hostile meeting.*\"

\"*Then perhaps you shouldn\'t have made this hostile by having your lackeys force me here,*\" *Kana growled.*

\"*I could say that no one forced you to come,*\" *Oriko said,* \"*but that\'d be mere posturing, I confess. Any self‐respecting team leader would feel bound to accept an offer to retrieve a missing team member, even at grave personal risk.*\"

\"*What, is that supposed to be flattery? Frankly, I\'m surprised you haven\'t killed me yet,*\" *Kana said, peering at Oriko over the rims of her glasses.* \"*What are you waiting for?*\"

\"*Don\'t tempt fate,*\" *Oriko said plainly.* \"*If I wanted to kill you, I could do so easily.*\"

\"*And now she wants to show off!*\" *Kana exclaimed sarcastically, gesturing at an imaginary audience, clearly refusing to be awed or cowed by Oriko.*

\"*Let\'s get down to brass tacks,*\" *Kana said, turning back towards Oriko.* \"*I wouldn\'t be here if you didn\'t want something from me, so what is it?*\"

*Oriko smiled slightly.*

\"*You\'re not going to believe me, but while I do have ulterior motives for this meeting, all I really want from you is some conversation.*\"

\"*Conversation,*\" *Kana echoed, clearly wondering if it was Oriko that had gone insane, or Kana herself.*

\"*Conversation,*\" *Oriko affirmed.*

\"*You can\'t just kill someone in my group and then expect to have conversation,*\" *Kana said, picking up her teaspoon and pointing at Oriko with it.* \"*Don\'t think I don\'t know you were behind that massive demon spawn somehow. It was too convenient.*\"

\"*You can believe what you like,*\" *Oriko said, shaking her head indulgently.*

\"*So, conversation,*\" *Kana repeated, clearly trying to rush things along.* \"*What is it that you\'d like to have* conversation *about?*\"

*Oriko set her coffee cup down onto its saucer with a dramatic clatter.*

\"*What is your opinion of the magical girl system that we live in?*\" Oriko asked.* \"*Do you think we are doomed to live this way?*\"

*Kana scowled, peering around the garden, at the trees, at the piles of leaves in the grass, and at Yuma.*

\"*That\'s an idealistic type of question,*\" *Kana said, shaking her head,* \"*but all of us who have survived have learned to deal with the world as it is. And, if I may point out, you and your team aren\'t doing the magical girl world in Mitakihara any favors.*\"

\"*And yet, you and your team run that food stand near the university, don\'t you?*\" *Oriko said.* \"*Who\'s ever heard of magical girls making money?*\"

\"*There\'s no way to scale it,*\" *Kana said.* \"*Not unless a girl with family money appeared out of nowhere. Though, speaking of that...*\"

\"*I\'m not here to offer you money,*\" *Oriko said,* \"*only to discuss the issue.*\"

\"*Then what the hell* is *this about?*\" *Kana asked.*

*Oriko smiled to herself, again sipping her coffee elegantly.*

\"*Kuroi Kana, what power do you have exactly?*\" *Oriko asked. "*I\'ve always wondered, since it\'s not one that\'s obvious whenever I spy on you. If you tell me, I\'ll let your friend and you go. Simple as that.*\"

*Kana made an annoyed noise.*

\"*If you can see the future, why don\'t you just foresee what my answer will be?*\"

*Oriko closed her eyes, smiling in amusement.*

\"*I still have to ask the question, don\'t I?*\"

*Kana made a snarling expression with her mouth, though she didn\'t vocalize.*

\"*I\'m a clairvoyant, okay? Kind of. I\'m kind of like you; I get random visions of the past. I wish I could control it like you can. I\'m not telling you more than that.*\"

*Oriko nodded.*

\"*Good enough,*\" *she said.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I remember Kana telling us about that incident,\" Mami said, shaking her head. \"That should have been the end of it. I told the others it was time to work together and get rid of Oriko once and for all. No one ever listens.\"

Yuma shifted uncomfortably. If Mami had any blind spots, Oriko was definitely one of them. Mami had never seemed to realize it might have been entirely reasonable for the other teams in the city to demure on the idea of having every single one of them assault Oriko\'s mansion in an apocalyptic showdown. Even aside from the numerous casualties such a venture would have inevitably caused, Mami never seemed to notice the obvious likelihood that Yuma herself would have ended up among the deceased.

Usually at this point Kyouko or Homura would have jumped in to change the topic, but neither of them were here, leaving Yuma to try to continue the conversation.

Unexpectedly, Mami shook her head, cutting Yuma off just as she opened her mouth to say something.

\"I know what you\'re thinking,\" Mami said. \"You\'re not wrong, but I can\'t help thinking if we had just ended things earlier, we would have saved the girls she killed later, and you would never have had to go through all you did.\"

Yuma looked down, studying the woven tresses of iron that circled the rim of their table.

\"Maybe,\" she said.

They turned to look at MG, who tilted her head in confusion, hair falling onto the table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The night the world changed again was unseasonably wet and hot, the sheets of water that filled heaven and earth only barely relieving the heat that plagued both.*

*It was the kind of night that was best spent inside in air‐conditioned comfort, even for magical girls that could shrug off such environmental conditions.*

*Even so, the need to patrol their territory for grief cubes was endless, especially when the team was effectively down a member, due to Oriko\'s refusal to allow Yuma to join the patrols most of the time. If anything, the best demon spawns seemed to be more common on gloomy days.*

*Oriko had led the rest of the team out after what she said was going to be a particularly lucrative demon spawn, leaving Yuma alone to read in peace.*

*In retrospect, Yuma would never be sure what exactly caused her to look up from her copy of \"The Guns of August\". Had she heard something? Seen something out of the corner of her eye? Or had something triggered on her magical radar?*

*Nonetheless, the fact was, Yuma frowned midway through the seventh chapter and looked up, peering across the room at an empty doorway.*

*There was only the slightest of shimmers.*

*Before Yuma even consciously grasped what was happening, she was up, transformed, and vaulting away from the chair, which fell into pieces a fraction of a section later, a blue shimmer revealing the silhouette of a magical girl.*

\"*Damn it!*\" *the girl said, her features becoming more defined. "*The bitch sniffed me!*\"

*Yuma didn\'t know who she was talking to, but she knew not to try to stick around and find out.*

*Her vault allowed her to land against the wall with one leg, which she used to push off and dive through the window of her room, landing on the grass outside in a shower of glass shards, some of which she felt dig into her skin.*

\"*Stay focused! Get her!*\" *a voice yelled from somewhere above her as she recovered and jumped towards her right, just in time to avoid a searing beam of light that came out of the sky nearly vertical. The intensity dazzled even her inhuman vision, blotting out the scene around her, but Yuma didn\'t stop moving.*

*She had to keep moving, had to reach the rest of her team. These were thoughts that hadn\'t yet explicitly crossed her mind, but which she already grasped by pure instinct. Survival depended on reaching Oriko. She could not take on her pursuers alone.*

*For the other team, of course, success in whatever they were doing involved keeping Yuma from raising the alarm, and they grasped that idea just as well.*

*Yuma slammed her hammer down into the ground, dispelling at the moment of impact the enchantment that allowed her to swing it as if it had no weight. The angular momentum of the massive hammer lifted her into the air as she restored the enchantment, launching both her and hammer forward with breathtaking speed.*

*Still in the air, she caught a glimpse of one of her pursuers---one she recognized, Tanaka Yui in absurd yellow kimono---and pushed herself away with telekinesis. This time she did not notice if the dodge had saved her from an attack.*

*Yuma gritted her teeth as she raced across the rooftops. She was unfamiliar with the skillset of Tanaka Yui\'s group, and had no idea if any of them had teleportation or fast movement powers. All she could really do was hope otherwise, run as fast as she could, and exploit her hammer trick as much as possible.*

*Slowly, painfully slowly, she felt the magical signatures of the girls behind her start to recede into the distance, and she allowed herself to breath a small sigh of relief and settle into a more straight‐line escape trajectory. She had been afraid that the other team, used as they were to the skyscrapers of Mitakihara\'s wealthy financial district, might have developed some variant of her hammer trick for easy travel. It wasn\'t terribly difficult, after all---just a minor exploitation of how summoning and dismissing magical equipment could be made to work---but it did require a little practice, and didn\'t seem to be the kind of thing most magical girls thought of.*

*One pertinent example of that: Yuma had avoided demonstrating this particular trick to the rest of the group, none of whom she had ever seen perform the feat. She could never really be sure whether or not Oriko knew something, but she suspected it was in her interest to keep a few secrets of her own, just... in case.*

*She caught a glimpse of a flash of light above her as she was midway in a long jump across a street, too far from any buildings or lampposts that she could use for leverage, and responded the only way she could---she massively increased the mass of her hammer, one of her innate abilities, and pushed it telekinetically as fast as she could away from her, bringing her to a dead stop in the middle of the air. It was the only thing she could do fast enough.*

*It was only* barely *fast enough, the searing shaft of pink light appearing in front of her just as her hammer slammed into the wall of a jewelry shop on the other side of the street, debris and glass flying outward as a display case smashed open.*

*Yuma landed on the roof of a car a moment later, the metal caving in under her fall, which she had accelerated with telekinesis---there was no time in a fight like this to wait for a leisurely fall down to the ground.*

*She had a fraction of a second to register her situation, clutching the neatly cauterized wound where the pink beam had severed her right forearm. The doorway of the jewelry store started to cave in, a startled security guard still in the process of trying to get away. The pedestrians on the street had stopped in shock, and a little boy in the street was turning to look at her, already dropping his popsicle. There was no miasma here to insulate the effects of magic on the world, and if there were security cameras in the area, they would show everything.*

*Yuma grimaced and jumped off of the vehicle, dashing away on foot, applying a temporary healing spell to her right arm to mitigate the damage. A confusion of thoughts swirled in her head: that she had been an idiot to let herself be lulled by complacency into a trap, that she and Oriko were bound to get an earful from Kyubey later, that she* knew that boy, he had been in her elementary school class---

*She shook her head at herself, telling herself she needed to* focus. She had to stay off the rooftops, stay close to the ground, stay out of sight---she was far enough now that the sheer speed of rooftop travel was probably less important than staying hidden, especially if one of them was capable of hitting her with a beam at this range.*

*In retrospect, she should have dove off the rooftop sooner, instead of just continuing to push forward. If she had hidden herself in plain sight in a crowd of pedestrians, she could have used the magical girl secret as a shield, rather than as the liability that it now was with her injured arm. The Incubators did not take intentional violations of the secret lightly---the terrifying whispered stories and rumors attested to that.*

Where are they? *Yuma thought, casting her mind outward desperately to search for traces of Oriko and the others. By this point Yuma had covered a significant portion of the Southern Group\'s territory, with both her and the Financial District Team shooting off massive spurts of magic---and yet Yuma couldn\'t sense any sign of the rest of her team, nor had Oriko and the others shown any sign of noticing what was going on. At the very least, Oriko, with her precognition, should have noticed something was up.*

*Traveling by foot on ground level was arduous---taking too large a road would put her in the line of sight of too many people, but taking alleyways would oblige her to constantly vault over barriers, avoid dead ends, and even escape the occasional dog. There was no time to worry about security cameras---she could only continue to rely on whatever magical aura or Incubator helped keep the secret in the age of increasing surveillance.*

*Just as she was on the verge of stopping again to check for continued pursuit, she finally caught a glimmer of one of her teammates, a small blip of power from what felt like Hinata Aina. She couldn\'t be entirely sure---it was extremely muted, as if Aina were doing her utmost to stay concealed, and Yuma probably wouldn\'t even have noticed it if she hadn\'t been Aina\'s teammate, and thus familiar with the tenor of her magic.*

Just what is going on? *she thought. They were in their own territory on a demon hunt, so there was no need to try for stealth. What were they doing?*

*Even so, Yuma had a lead now, and she followed it, turning away from the northern edge of their territory toward a point more to the west, within part of the city\'s industrial district. There were far fewer people here, which made her sneaking job much easier, and she could no longer sense active pursuit. It seemed like Tanaka Yui\'s team had abandoned their hunt, though Yuma could only venture a guess what they were doing to Oriko\'s now completely empty mansion. It was the kind of thing that would demand full retaliation.*

*She finally slowed her pace, taking a moment to risk applying healing magic to her arm, which was piecing itself back together nicely. If there was one advantage to being a healer, it was that even the most gruesome injuries could be repaired in short order, as long as she had a little bit of time to deal with it. This wasn\'t the first time Yuma had lost a body part, and she doubted it would be her last. It was an important enough skill that all the teams without a natural healer had at least one member who actively practiced the skill.*

*More importantly, she now had a constant lead on the rest of her teammates, who were indeed keeping their power emissions suppressed and staying oddly stationary. It looked like they were inside a large, abandoned‐looking warehouse next to a small factory complex.*

*By this point Yuma had slowed to a walk, gazing around her in wonder and confusion, though she remained watchful for any workers who might wonder what a girl in cosplay was doing way out here. What on Earth were they doing here? She couldn\'t sense a single demon or even a whiff of miasma---not for miles and miles.*

*Yuma had been keeping her own soul gem emissions as clamped down as possible to avoid giving away her position to Tanaka Yui and her team, but now she clamped it down even further, dismissing even her own transformation. If there was one thing altering her own brain structure had done, it was improve her ability to see the obvious: whatever it was Oriko and the others were doing here, Yuma wasn\'t intended to know about it.*

*What was less obvious was whether it was really wise to try to find out what they were hiding, and sneak up on them untransformed.*

*In truth, she suspected that the answer to that was no, but she felt compelled to press forward.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"You knew there was something seriously wrong going on,\" Mami commented, more calm now that they had gotten into the parts of the story she was more familiar with.

\"In retrospect, yes,\" Yuma said. \"I guess I was tired of the mystery. Even without cognitive augmentations, it would have been obvious to me that there was something twisted about the situation I was in. I just... didn\'t think it would be so bad.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Glass crunched underneath her shoes as she searched for a doorway into the warehouse. It had been a long time since she had felt the need to sneak anywhere as only approximately a regular girl, and it felt... disabling. Even in her daily life, most of her time was spent within the grounds of Oriko\'s mansion, where there was no need to hide how far she could vault or how fast she could move---she had gotten rather used to heading up the stairs in only a couple of long jumps.*

*If she felt this weak just staying pinned to the ground, she wondered how she had ever managed to deal with being tired, or being unable to keep up, or baking under the heat on her way home from school---all routine occurrences in her previous life, especially at school.*

*She tried a few doors, but the obvious entrances were all sealed---not merely locked, with the kind of lock she could have considered working open with telekinesis, but actually* sealed, *the doorknob assembly and hinges seeming to have been melted shut, probably by Aina. That didn\'t mean she couldn\'t have smashed the door open, but doing so didn\'t exactly make for a quiet, deniable entrance.*

*Instead, she stopped and looked around. Clearly, the intention here was that no normal human would ever go inside the building, not without power tools, but how exactly had Oriko and the others got in? They had no team teleporter, and unless one of the others had somehow learned the skill---*

Oh, duh, the windows, *she thought, noting that the top of the warehouse had an array of glass windows set into the wall of the building. It was the kind of entrance that could only be used easily by a magical girl, or perhaps an experienced thief, requiring the ability to reach the third story---then stay there while opening a window from the outside, at least if you didn\'t want to be too obvious about just breaking a window.*

*Yuma frowned. Her natural inclination was to jump up to the window and just head in, but even if exercising the existing capabilities of her enhanced body was the safest, least detectable use of magic, a magical girl showing up at the window was probably exactly what they would be expecting. If there were traps, if there was someone watching, it\'d be there.*

*She chewed her lip for a moment, even as she stepped away from the building to get a better view. There simply had to be another way in. It was frustrating to know that she just had to break one of the doors down, but instead---*

*She stopped, realizing in that moment what she needed to do.*

*She shimmied up to the nearest doorway, the one she had ignored earlier after discovering that it, too, was sealed shut.*

I hope this works, *she thought, putting one hand flat against the door, which appeared to be an unostentatious single‐door service entrance.*

*In terms of magic, healing a piece of equipment was not terribly far off from healing a person, even if they were very different in material terms, and Oriko had encouraged Yuma to work on the skill, given how useful it was for the pieces of jury‐rigged machinery scattered around Oriko\'s lab---not to mention the shocking improvement in team standing Yuma had accrued from her ability to fix the electronics Kirika routinely broke in rage, or Aina\'s constantly virus‐plagued laptop, or the clogged toilet no one wanted to touch. Even so, Yuma rarely used the power outside of a few, limited \"handy girl\" type settings, and at first she simply hadn\'t considered healing the door. It was thinking outside the box.*

*A moment later, she \"felt\" the door heal underneath her magic. There was, of course, the risk that someone inside would notice the small spurt of magic, but it was a risk she had to take---after all, working the windows open with telekinesis would have carried the same risks.*

*She turned the doorknob experimentally, cautiously, and felt it turn smoothly and give way. It seemed Oriko and the others hadn\'t bothered locking the door before sealing it.*

*She stepped into the building, closing the door behind her carefully, then dispelling her temporary healing spell, letting the door revert to its previous state.* That *ability wasn\'t new---she had always been capable of healing something temporarily, an ability that was usually only useful in extremely hectic combat, when there simply wasn\'t time to do a more permanent job.*

*She let out a small breath, her nose wrinkling at the dust that imbued the small hallway she found herself in. Clearly, no one had been here for a long, long time, which meant that she had chosen her entry point well.*

*Now she faced the task of working her way through the building without being discovered.*

*She did everything she could to dampen her soul gem signal, while stretching her mind to track the others as accurately as possible.*

I am a limpid pool of water, *she thought, recalling the mental exercises that Oriko had drilled into her.* I am motionless and still, reflecting only the ripples of that which disturbs me.

*She mouthed the words of the mantra to herself as she stepped her way gingerly into the building, looking for a way up. Ideally, she needed a staircase located far away from any of the other girls, so that she could ascend without the risk of immediately being spotted.*

*Unfortunately, she couldn\'t see anything like that anywhere nearby; instead, she quickly found herself at the end of the hallway, facing the kind of double door that you often saw leading into restaurant kitchens, complete with a transparent window set into the middle.*

*Cautiously, Yuma stepped to the side of the door, craning her neck to peer into what was beyond.*

*She remembered when she would have been too short to see inside without standing on tiptoes. It seemed like an eternity ago.*

*On the other side of the doorway was what looked like the main body of the warehouse, a wide open space that at the moment looked completely empty---whatever large machines or equipment had once been here were long gone. Elevated walkways hung from the ceiling, servicing whatever had been there, and Yuma could see the windows she had considered jumping through earlier.*

*Other than that, nothing.*

*Yuma really didn\'t want to step out into that open area. It would be far too easy for someone concealed on the upper levels or on the other side of the room to spot her stepping in---there were too many blind spots she simply could not cover, and she could tell that she was getting increasingly close to the others.*

*She looked around behind her, but just didn\'t see another way. All the rooms she had passed had clearly been dead ends, and the hallway led directly from the outer doorway to here.*

*She briefly considered going back outside and using a different door, then shook her head at herself.*

What am I even doing here? *she thought, leaning slightly to push the door open.* I\'m going to have to sneak back out after sneaking in, and what if I get caught, what then? What if they---

*Just as the door began to move, she froze and jumped backwards, almost yelping out loud. She had felt a soul gem nearby pulse with power. It wasn\'t anyone she knew, but it came from the same place where Oriko and the others were.*

*Now that she had sensed it, she could tell that it was releasing power nearly constantly, at a higher level than Oriko and the others.*

*Something... was off about it.*

*Yuma swallowed, mastering her fear with the mental techniques Oriko had taught her, careful not to accidentally exert any of her magic. If the unthinkable happened, Yuma reassured herself that she could probably escape, as long as she managed to dodge Kirika\'s magic aura. Then, she could fling herself onto the mercy of Sakura Kyouko\'s group, who had shown sympathy for her. At the very least, she could promise them some of Oriko\'s knowledge.*

*Crazy, that she was even considering something like that. In her heart, she knew she simply didn\'t trust Oriko as much as she once had.*

*She pushed the door open again, just a little, just enough to let herself squeeze through, glancing around in every direction, and especially in the direction she now sensed the rest of her team.*

*There was still nothing.*

*She edged along the walls, thankful that plenty of support columns and wooden crates had remained in the room to hide behind. She strained, exerting her supernatural body control to minimize the sound of her footfalls. She felt like a mouse---and wondered who the cat was.*

*At the far end of the room was a small metal staircase that led to the walkways above. In her deliberately hyper‐aware state, the soul gem emanations from both the unknown girl and her teammates were becoming oppressive---taken together it felt like a constant, nagging pulsation in her head. Whatever she was looking for was in this direction, but the only doorways she could continue into were up above, not down here.*

*She was also close enough now that it was not just her familiarity with her teammates that enabled her to sense them so clearly---they were unmistakably exerting their magic, straining to perform some kind of technique while at the same time keeping their soul gems hidden. It was also possible that whatever it was they were doing, it was preventing any of them from keeping watch, which would explain why there was no one here to notice Yuma, even though she was already so close.*

*Yuma stepped onto the staircase, painfully aware of how exposed she was. She could only hope it wasn\'t booby---*

Someone help! I know you\'re out there! They\'re---

*The telepathic cry for help came out weak and strangled, but distinct, freezing Yuma on the spot. She gripped the railing in sudden fear that she had been discovered, and was only able to master it after a long, terrified moment.*

*It was only then that she had realized that the voice had come from the same source as the mysterious, unknown soul gem, in a room somewhere just above.*

I can\'t linger here, *she thought.* I have to get out of this exposed spot.

*She dashed up the staircase, sacrificing a bit of her silent footwork for the sake of getting up to the next level, instantly flattening herself against the wall when she reached the top.*

*To her immediate right was a small side passage that led into what she would have guessed was the office of whoever had once run this building. Whatever was going on was going on inside here.*

*Yuma resisted the urge to take a deep breath to steady herself, and slid as stealthily as she could along the dusty, age‐worn wall. With any luck, there would be some sort of window she could try to peek into.*

*What she got instead was even better---not just a window, but a window that looked down onto the room below, which turned out to be not an office, but some kind of workshop, one that had once held rather tall machinery. It gave her an excellent view of what was going on below.*

*As she had begun to suspect, she had been better off without the view.*

*The four other members of her team stood in a semicircle around a fifth girl, who had been tied down to what looked like a dentist\'s chair. Oriko stood in the middle, holding a glowing pink soul gem.*

*Yuma knew it belonged to no one of her team.*

*As she watched, the other three girls focused their attention on Oriko, directing their magic at the girl clad in white, who had her eyes closed, performing some kind of operation on the soul gem.*

You monsters, *Yuma heard the unknown girl think, the telepathy barely audible to her even at such close range. Somehow, Oriko was blocking the transmission.*

\"*Monsters?*\" *Mikuru said out loud, sneering.* \"*I suppose we are, but so are you, and so are all of us. What gives you the right to judge us?*\"

\"*You see, the only thing that matters among monsters is power,*\" *she said, leaning over the other girls.* \"*I learned that when I was powerless, and then I got power, and now here we are. I thought someone like you would have learned something as fundamental as that by now.*\"

*Mikuru raised one gloved hand, splaying her fingers out and peering at them with an expression of twisted fascination.*

\"*I killed them all,*\" *she said.* \"*If you had the power to, you could kill me too.*\"

\"*It can all be over soon,*\" *Oriko said, tilting her head slightly. "*Stop resisting the soul probe, and I promise your end will be quick and painless. Otherwise, we have more tricks than just a little soul gem‐induced pain.*\"

*Yuma\'s* Onee‐chan *looked at Hinata Aina meaningfully, and the fire mage raised one hand, summoning on the tip of her index finger a small, pure‐blue flame.*

\"*You know,*\" *she said, smiling satanically,* \"*I\'m almost glad this technique doesn\'t work without consent. Imagine how boring this would be, if we could just take what we wanted. No, it\'s not delicious until we* make *someone consent.*\"

\"*It\'d be much easier that way, love,*\" *Mikuru said, looking at Aina.* \"*This whole process is too convoluted. All this work, and only meager reward. It\'s all well and good to learn a tiny bit of our enemies\' abilities, but imagine if we could take it* all. *We\'d be unstoppable. Instead of reveling in power, we\'re stuck here trying to squeeze out tiny drops, all because we can\'t get anyone to* give in.\"

*Aina gave Mikuru a look.*

\"*Not this again. Are your memories flaring up again?*\"

\"*Shut your mouth---*\" *Mikuru growled, advancing on Aina.*

\"*Oh, for the love of everything, can you two stop arguing for five goddamn seconds?*\" *Kirika began, scraping her metal claws screechingly against the examination chair.* \"*You\'d think we were the damn ones being tortured! This is a goddamned experiment, and all you can two can do is make us look stupid! No wonder it\'s so damn hard to do!*\"

*The three of them began arguing loudly, but by then Yuma had stopped listening, clenching her hands so tightly she was certain she was drawing blood. She quaked with suppressed anger, frustration, and impotence, forcing her eyes closed to stop the tears from flowing.*

*She didn\'t know what was worse, or where the sense of betrayal was the strongest. Was it the revelation that Miroko Mikuru was just as insane as the others? Mikuru, whose self‐talk had started to seem like a harmless quirk, who Yuma had begun to look up to, just a little?*

*Or was it Oriko\'s empty, pitilessly cold voice? Her warm, loving Onee‐chan, *strapping girls to a chair and, and---*

*She felt the tingling coldness begin to run up her arm, and was glad, in a twisted way, for Oriko\'s training. By distancing her soul gem from her body, she could reduce the physical effect of her emotions, reduce the urge to scream, reduce the urge to summon her magic, reduce---*

\"*Silence!*\" *Oriko said, at a volume only a magical girl could produce without screaming, her message blasted full‐force telepathically as well as verbally.*

*The other three stopped bickering.*

\"*We have company,*\" *Oriko said, turning her head to look up at the ceiling.*

*For an endless, terrified moment, Yuma thought Oriko had noticed her.*

*Then Yuma sensed what she had meant.*

*Everything happened at once: the ceiling above Oriko blasting open in a burst of blinding pink, Oriko dodging backward, Mikuru protecting them all with a shield of arctic‐blue ice---*

*Oriko closing her hand on the soul gem she held, the glass breaking into shards that burst out almost explosively from between her fingers---*

*The magical girls of the Financial District team breaking through the ceiling, attacking with everything they had, in what they surely hoped was a surprise attack.*

*A bubble of yellow magic surrounded Kirika and flung her to the side, just as she started trying to cast her \"slow time\" aura on the assailants, sending the girl* through *a solid concrete wall. A circular distortion appeared next to Aina, absorbing the massive fireball she had fired---which reappeared instantly next to Mikuru\'s ice shield with all its momentum.*

*The shield shattered instantly, forcing Mikuru, Aina, and Oriko to scatter and dodge.*

*Then the swordsman of the group, the same stealth assassin that had targeted Yuma, materialized directly behind Oriko while she was still in the air, already swinging her weapon. Unlike most lower‐level magical attacks and projectiles, it could not be blocked by the cloud of spheres Oriko used to protect herself, even with battle precognition.*

*It was a well‐planned, well‐executed attack, targeted directly at the most valuable member of the Southern Group, but it was desperate---Oriko simply couldn\'t be surprised like that, and the other team surely knew it. They had come to try to save their friend, even when they knew Oriko would almost certainly crush her soul gem the moment they appeared.*

*All of that ran through Yuma\'s mind in the milliseconds it took for Oriko to abruptly spin around, catch her attacker\'s wrist as she swung, and send them both into an air spiral.*

*Yuma heard the girl\'s wrist crack as they fell, just before Oriko slammed the other girl straight into the ground, back first.*

*The girl coughed spasmodically, globules of blood splattering onto Oriko\'s face, but she still had enough presence of mind to dispel her own sword, just as Oriko jumped back and allowed it to fall straight down into the other girl\'s chest.*

*Another millisecond later, another distortion appeared in front of Oriko---a portal, Yuma now realized---and a powerful kick sent Oriko flying backwards, even though she had blocked it with both her arms.*

*A white‐and‐orange‐clad girl dove out of the portal, applying both hands to her stricken comrade, who was already getting up.*

*A* healer, *Yuma realized.*

*Yuma stood there in torn confusion and fascination, not just at the battle in front of her but also at herself, at her own feelings. She wriggled the fingers of one hand, realizing that, for the first time since she had contracted, she felt no compulsion to intervene to save her own team. Indeed, part of her---a small part of her, but one that had never existed before---wanted her to do the exact opposite.*

*Then the other team leader, Tanaka Yui, turned her head a little, looking directly at Yuma.*

*Their eyes met for a moment, and Yuma experienced one of those blinding flashes of insight she would come to realize accompanied the modifications she had made to her brain.*

She knows I\'m here, *Yuma thought,* but she isn\'t attacking me. She\'s not surprised, so she knew I was here before they launched the attack. That means---

*They had followed her, even when she didn\'t think she was being followed. Of course they had---a team with a member that could make portals in midair could have easily caught Yuma at any time. And the reason they weren\'t attacking her...*

*What was Tanaka Yui\'s specialty?* Mind‐reading. *What would she have seen if she were reading Yuma\'s mind just before the attack? If she were reading Yuma\'s mind now?*

Indecision. Uncertainty. Loss of loyalty. Maybe even...

*She stood there for a moment longer, rooted, watching the battle unfold, telepath versus precognitive. Oriko reading the future, and then Yui reading what she saw straight out of her mind. It was a battle that would probably end in stalemate, both sides exhausted.*

*Except, of course, for the girl who was already dead, her corpse tied to a chair, her soul in evaporating pieces on the floor.*

*Then Yuma turned and ran, and as she ran she tried desperately to sift through her conflicted, nonsensical emotions. If she had intervened, it wouldn\'t have made any difference. Oriko would have seen Yuma\'s actions before she even did them, and thus so would Yui.*

*Even so, she felt like a coward. Of course she did. That was the wrong question. The question was* why *she felt like a coward.*

*She wished she knew.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Oh Goddess, humans are *monsters,*\" MG said.

Yuma grimaced. MG had been a little too honest about her feelings there---Yuma could hardly have avoided knowing what AIs sometimes talked about in their mutual discussions, but it was not something fit to be transmitted widely, any more than Yuma and Mami would have openly discussed AI arrogance in front of MG.

\"Sometimes,\" Mami said acidly, \"And one of our flaws is stereotyping large groups based on a single event.\"

\"*Some.* I meant *some,*\" MG amended, too late.

Mami\'s look was withering, but Yuma couldn\'t help but think that most of her anger was actually transferred unease about Yuma\'s story. Nothing here was new to Mami---Yuma had told her this truth centuries ago---but it didn\'t take a telepath to know that Mami disliked the topic.

Mami was usually more charitable about MG, who was after all a young AI. Besides, the ability of AIs to even make slips of the tongue or stereotype poorly was on some level reflective of their inherent humanity, which meant the levels of irony here extended even deeper than Mami implied.

\"Soul probing though?\" MG asked, handling Mami\'s disapprobation well. "What were they even trying to do?\"

\"Something I wish wasn\'t even possible,\" Mami said, looking down into her tea. \"Something we\'ve kept as secret as possible. It---\"

\"So it of course goes without saying that you shouldn\'t go spreading this around, not that you would,\" Yuma said, taking over the explanation before Mami could make it too dramatic. She knew what memories Mami was sifting over in her mind, and she knew they were not memories Mami preferred to have.

\"What *is* it though?\" MG asked.

\"A technique Oriko was working on,\" Yuma said, biting into a cookie she had summoned out of the ether. \"Put simply, every magical girl has a specialty in magic, a set of magic abilities and skills that they are gifted with at the time of contract, that doesn\'t require training or skill development to acquire. Fundamentally, though, it\'s just a form of knowledge, and we know from investigations into magic that anything can be replicated, provided you have the right *knowledge.*\"

Yuma bit into her cookie again nervously, aware that she was over‐elaborating an explanation she had been trying to make short.

\"Anyway, Oriko was trying to extract this knowledge forcibly from other magical girls and use it herself. Imagine, a magical girl with access to more than one magical specialty! It\'s a good thing that it turns out to require consent, and that magical girls turn out to be very difficult to coerce. It\'s apparently one of those ironclad rules.\"

\"All these hidden rules in the system,\" Mami said, shaking her head, "and the Incubators won\'t even tell us if they made the rules, or if they come from somewhere else.\"

\"But if all it takes is consent, then why couldn\'t you use it for good, to train super‐powered mages?\" MG asked. \"Trade powers, something like that?\"

Yuma saw Mami\'s nostrils flare in outrage, even as she sensed MG\'s entirely logical train of thought, which centered on how useful something like that would be in the war.

\"Well, further research showed that the process could never be completed without killing the person whose knowledge was being extracted,\" Yuma said, closing her eyes carefully. \"So that put the kibosh on the idea of using it productively.\"

\"Oh,\" MG said.

Yuma kept her eyes closed, thinking careful thoughts that she kept sealed away from MG\'s connection to her mind.

Of course, the development of the MSY and its facilities for studying magic meant that mages couldn\'t be prevented from occasionally stumbling on the possibility, no matter how hard they tried to erase knowledge of its existence. And while magical girls, if trained properly, could not be coerced through direct pain, there were plenty of other, more psychological options.

It was inevitable that one or two couldn\'t resist the temptation, and inevitable that the opposition in the great schism of the Unification Wars would resort to such tactics. The former had been heavily Mami\'s responsibility, and the latter Yuma\'s. Neither of them had passed through the experience unscarred.

Yuma opened her eyes.

\"Well, we might as well continue.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*If Yuma hadn\'t been a magical girl, she would have stopped running when she got tired, probably only a block or two away from the warehouse.*

*As it was, she only stopped running when it abruptly occurred to her that she no longer recognized her surroundings---that she had never been in this particular section of town before.*

*That was not a good sign, since it heavily implied she was no longer in her team\'s sector. By itself, that meant little---standard practice in Mitakihara allowed unlimited travel between different magical girl territories, as long as you had a clear reason for travel and avoided magic use. It could hardly be otherwise, after all---enforcing strict borders would have separated some girls from friends and family, and everyone from the best grocery stores, hardware stores, and the like. In the ordinary course of things a girl like Yuma, especially with her young age, would have had little to fear.*

*Everything was different for the Southern Group, though, and it was her misfortune that she had fallen in with them.*

*Yuma took a moment to look around in more detail. She seemed to be surrounded by, of all things, butcher shops, and she had a feeling the larger structures she could see farther down the block were all slaughterhouses---the closer ones declared as much on the large billboards that served as identifying signage.*

*Only one building really stood out from the rest. It looked like, of all things---*

\"*Are you alright, child? Are you lost?*\"

*Startled, Yuma looked up at the adult that had materialized over her shoulder. She was no longer as short as she had once been, but the man was still tall enough to loom over her, shading out the sun from her perspective.*

*At a glance, she took in the relevant details---the black clothing, the visible cross---and paired it with the building she had just seen. This was an odd place to find a Christian church, of all things.*

\"*I saw you running,*\" *the man said, tilting his head.* \"*I wanted to make sure everything was alright.*\"

*Yuma shrugged. On the one hand, she didn\'t really know what to say. Things were manifestly* not *alright, but there was no way she could explain that, but she didn\'t feel like lying, or escaping.*

*On the other hand, she also felt apathetic about whatever this man thought of her. It was a new feeling for her, the apathy, but it was real. On some degree, she couldn\'t motivate herself to* care. *What did it matter anyway?*

*The man closed his eyes, bowing his head slightly.*

\"*Well, I won\'t ask too many questions. But if you\'re running away from something, or if you need somewhere to stay, we can house you. You won\'t even be the only one. Not in this district.*\"

*Yuma gave the man a puzzled look. In this district? What did he mean by that?*

\"*Sure, why not?*\" *she said, finally.* \"*I could use a place to rest.*\"

*It was probably for the best to stay off the streets and out of sight, at least until she was prepared to go back, or Oriko came looking for her.*

*She paused on the threshold of the aged wooden building, looking around.*

That\'s the butcher\'s district, *she remembered her mother saying.* You don\'t want to go there.

Oh, that\'s what it is about this district, *she thought.*

*She had meant the ambivalence with which she had responded to the pastor\'s offer, she realized, as they stepped their way past empty wooden pews. It legitimately didn\'t matter where she was, and staying inside the building of some foreign religion beat wandering the streets mindlessly. She didn\'t even have any money on her.*

*It was a gloomy, overly‐dark building, she thought, squinting around the darkened main worship hall. It could have used some stained glass, some sunlight pouring through some windows---anything to brighten the overall mood.*

*As the man led her into the back hallways, it occurred to her to check her soul gem. She summoned an image of the gem out of the ring, blocking it from sight with her other hand. As she had gathered from the malaise that had settled over her, it was significantly dark, and she clearly wasn\'t going to get access to grief cubes anytime soon.*

*That was the beauty of it, though, wasn\'t it? She didn\'t really care, because her soul gem was going dark, and her soul was going dark because she didn\'t care. She felt like giggling.*

\"*I\'m going to have to apologize,*\" *the pastor said, stopping in front of an aged‐looking wooden door.* \"*This isn\'t the most comfortable of places, or the prettiest.*\"

\"*It\'s alright,*\" *Yuma said, out of social habit more than anything.*

\"*We used to have a much better church out in Kazamino City,*\" *he said.* \"*It had its own grove of trees and beautiful windows like you wouldn\'t believe. It burned down, though.*\"

\"*Uh‐huh,*\" *Yuma nodded along, wondering what relevance any of this had.*

\"*I\'ve always blamed myself for it, a little,*\" *the pastor said, looking up at the low ceiling.* \"*A whole family died in that fire. Afterward, I saw one of the girls from that family on the streets, after she was supposed to be dead; I\'ve been trying to find her ever since. I haven\'t yet, but in the meantime, it can\'t possibly hurt to take in some other lost sheep.*\"

*Yuma looked up and met the man\'s eye. He held the doorknob in his hand, but made no move to turn it.*

*She looked away, refusing the obvious attempt to dig for information.*

\"*Well, here we are then,*\" *he said, finally opening the door.* \"*A bit of a rec‐room, to pass the time. I\'ll get some snacks.*\"

*He looked around the room for a moment, seeming bothered by something, then shuffled her into a dingy‐looking lounge area, consisting of a few worn couches, a wooden table, and some game sets that looked like they were at the absolute limit of their usable lifespan, and then some. A side passage led to a pair of bathrooms.*

*The door closed behind her, and she immediately collapsed onto one of the couches, ignoring the complaints it made under her relatively minuscule weight. There was nothing she felt like doing, except waiting. But waiting for what?*

*The toilet flushed in one of the bathrooms, and a moment later a faucet began to run. Inwardly, she groaned. The last thing she wanted was company.*

*The door to the bathroom creaked open, a tired‐looking young man stepping out. He wiped his hands casually on his pants as he stepped out into the room---then froze.*

*Before Yuma knew what she was doing, she was in front of him, gripping his throat in one hand. The man grasped instinctively at her grip, choking pathetically.*

*She remembered that same throat underneath her hands, freshly sealed back together from what had once been two separate pieces of flesh, and gagged, releasing her grip and recoiling, abruptly unable to stomach the idea of destroying what she had once healed.*

*The man nearly fell over, then coughed once, twice.*

\"*What the hell are you doing here?*\" *Yuma demanded, surprised at the force of her own voice.*

\"*It\'s not what you think,*\" *he managed, coughing once more. "*I\'m hiding.*\"

\"*Hiding,*\" *Yuma repeated emptily. The word almost didn\'t make sense to her.*

\"*From my colleagues---former colleagues,*\" *the man said, rubbing his neck self‐consciously.* \"*I had some time to think, after you---uh. Well, you gain a new perspective on life, once you\'ve had a chance to see your own severed neck.*\"

*Yuma didn\'t know what she was supposed to think, or how she was supposed to feel. Was this her nightmares coming to life? It felt like an absurdist tableau, to know she had saved the life of someone she should have hated, and here he was again, somehow, telling her about the experience.*

*The man closed his eyes, holding his head stiffly in place. It occurred to Yuma that far from being self‐assured, he seemed as confused as she did. She supposed she couldn\'t blame him.*

\"*I came here, after what happened,*\" *he said, carefully avoiding looking at her.* \"*To be honest, I think the pastor thought I was crazy when I told him my story, but after we talked I kind of reached a conclusion. I---*\"

*The Yakuza tough seemed to falter mid‐sentence, and Yuma peered at his face. Was he... embarrassed?*

*Yuma decided that this definitely* had *to be an absurdist tableau, though in that case she wondered just whose tableau it was.*

*The door behind her opened with a creak a moment later.*

\"*I couldn\'t help but overhear,*\" *the pastor said, stepping into the room carrying a bowl of tangerines.* \"*It sounds like you two have met before. Kurosawa‐san, is this...?*\"

*Yuma looked at the priest, then at the young man, trying to infer what was happening.*

\"*Yes,*\" *Kurosawa said finally.*

*The priest took a moment to set the bowl of fruit down on the battered‐looking table.*

\"*Well, this is clearly a bit of a divine coincidence then,*\" *he said, looking at Yuma with a penetrating expression.* \"*He\'s told me about you. He said you healed him from an injury. I\'m not sure if I believe that, but sometimes miracles happen.*\"

*The priest\'s look at Yuma was deeply inquisitive, and she wondered what he was looking for, and what she could possibly say. Not the truth, certainly---not as long as she could avoid it. The Incubators understood that sometimes there was no other way, but the rumors about what happened to those who deliberately revealed the secret were... unpleasant.*

\"*Don\'t be too hard on him,*\" *the priest said finally, gesturing at Kurosawa.* \"*If I\'m right, you have every right to be, but he\'s tried to make amends for his life. He helped some of the girls they were holding escape to the police. That\'s why I\'m hiding him here. Sinners deserve mercy.*\"

*Yuma furrowed her brow, trying not to make it too obvious that she was deeply perplexed. She didn\'t just not know how to respond---she no longer fully understood the conversation. She wasn\'t used to being confused like this---not anymore, not after the changes she had made to her brain.*

\"*Are you an angel?*\" *Kurosawa asked, the question sounding desperate as it came out.* \"*I have to know.*\"

*Yuma experienced another moment of even greater confusion, as she saw the priest turn to look at the man reproachfully.*

*Then, in a flash, she understood what was going on. This man and this priest were convinced she might be an* angel.

*The very idea was so absurd that she almost broke out laughing, but then she saw---*

*She saw Oriko and Mikuru looming over her the day her parents had almost given her away, looking so much like angels themselves. She saw Tanaka\'s eyes wide with shock, impaled to the ground with a shard of blue ice.*

*She saw Oriko pushing herself up off the ground, shortly after Yuma had wished her body back together.*

*She reeled, staggering in the direction of the table, bracing herself so she didn\'t fall.*

*Her vision cleared again a moment later, and she found herself being steadied by the pastor and Kurosawa. She knew her soul gem had almost lost integrity for a moment, and wondered what had held her together.*

\"*No, I\'m not an angel,*\" *she said, shaking her head slightly, standing decisively to indicate that she was alright.* \"*Far from it.*\"

\"*I didn\'t really think so,*\" *the priest said, looking between the two of them.* \"*But why does Kurosawa‐san think you are?*\"

\"*I saved his life when I had no reason to,*\" *she said, surprised by how smooth her half‐truth sounded.* \"*I guess that might be something.*\"

*Kurosawa made a pinched face, but said nothing. He probably knew he had no chance of successfully insisting that his version of events was true. He probably didn\'t fully believe it himself.*

*The priest closed his eyes, letting out a breath.*

\"*Well, okay,*\" *he said.* \"*I won\'t ask how that happened, or why, but do you two want to talk in private? I kind of butted in, and now I realize maybe I shouldn\'t have.*\"

*Yuma made a gesture with one shoulder that indicated she didn\'t really care. It was an odd feeling, having her opinion respected, and one that she still wasn\'t used to even after multiple years without her abusive parents. It probably didn\'t help that of the members of the Southern Group, only Mikuru and Oriko seemed to care what she thought, even if she could plausibly claim to be a teenager now, rather than just a child.*

Mikuru and Oriko... *she repeated to herself.*

*Did they really care, or had they only pretended?*

*She shook her head at herself, realizing that she had zoned out mid‐conversation. Whatever focus she had once possessed was clearly leaving her.*

*Nonetheless, the priest was in the process of leaving the room, making it clear that Kurosawa had probably said something about wanting to talk to Yuma.*

*It occurred to her that if she wasn\'t confident she could break the man\'s spine with her bare hands, the prospect of being left alone with a Yakuza enforcer, reformed or not, might have been concerning.*

*The man was clearly still collecting his thoughts as to what to say, but Yuma decided to get the jump on him. She wasn\'t in a pleasant mood and felt a kind of sudden... strength? Rage?*

*Those were both wrong---it was more like she couldn\'t be motivated to care about niceties.*

\"*Look, I\'m glad you\'re grateful for not being dead,*\" *she said, "*and I\'m glad you tried to do something about it. That\'s more than I would expect out of most people. But that doesn\'t really make up for all the things that you\'ve probably done, and it doesn\'t make me see any reason to like you or forgive you, if that\'s what you want. Take your reattached head and make the best of it, I\'d say, but leave me alone.*\"

*The man\'s shoulders, who had been slowly collapsing under her criticism, jerked at the last sentence.*

\"*So that really did happen?*\" *he said, looking carefully at a far corner.* \"*I mean, I won\'t say I haven\'t thought I might be crazy---*\"

\"*Yes, it really happened. So what? More things in heaven and earth, Horatio.*\"

*The man looked confused by her sentence, but shook his head, turning away to avoid looking at her. She had noticed that he seemed more afraid of her than anything.*

\"*I don\'t know what you are,*\" *he said, sighing.* \"*Now that I think about it, I don\'t know what I wanted to say to you. Thank you? It doesn\'t sound like you want my thanks. I guess---I don\'t know. I had some vague idea about telling you about my life, to make you understand. You\'re right, though. I\'m just making excuses.*\"

*A long silence stretched between them, Yuma savoring for the moment the reversed power dynamic. She was totally in command of this conversation, and they both knew it. That wasn\'t a feeling Yuma got often---not one she had* ever *had, she realized.*

\"*Well, out with it then,*\" *she said.* \"*You want to tell me about your life, do it. I don\'t really have anything better to do.*\"

*She meant it, too. Whatever it was this Kurosawa wanted to tell her about, it was preferable by far to being alone with her thoughts. She had no desire to face the truth of her life just yet.*

*The man gave her a cautious look, shifting to his left to sit in the aged sofa that occupied the corner of the room. It creaked ponderously under his weight, seemingly on the verge of collapse.*

*Yuma made no move to sit. Remaining standing gave her the psychological advantage, and one of the small, unspoken advantages of being a magical girl was a preternatural resilience to the rigors of staying upright. According to Oriko, as magical girls got increasingly older, and increasingly aware of their new bodies\' expanded limitations, they often got increasingly obvious in the midst of a crowd---the veteran magical girl would be the steady rock in the midst of the roiling waves, immune to heat and cold and exhaustion, much larger men bouncing off of them with a confused look, as if they had just run into a brick wall. Often, they could be detected this way even when they were trying to hide, suppressing their soul gem emissions as much as possible. Go out on a hot day, Oriko said, and the veteran magical girl will be the one not *sweating.*

*Her mind was wandering again, she realized. Probably another symptom of her soul gem depletion. She wondered why it was causing her mind to wander, rather than obsess over her troubles. The first was more typical of a magical girl running out of power due to magic exhaustion, rather than for psychological reasons---and she was pretty sure her reasons were psychological.*

\"*---I want you to know, I never set out to end up where I ended up. I don\'t know---I don\'t have any great excuses, but I didn\'t want to follow my parents into the family business, being a butcher and having to deal with all the shit they have to go through. You might be too young to know this, but in this region of town, the only choice if you want a different life is to join the Yaks, and that\'s what I did. I didn\'t really have a choice in what they assigned me to.*\"

*Yuma said nothing, choosing instead to stare blankly at a fork she carried in her hand. To her ear, what the man was saying did sound a lot like making excuses---except if she rejected his excuses, she would have difficulty maintaining her own. Viewed through the lens of circumstance, Yuma had had little choice when it came to joining the Southern Group, and though she had never participated directly in the crimes that her group had committed, she had always known, on some level, what was really happening.*

*And done nothing.*

*So, she was better than this guy, but not by as much as she would have wanted.*

\"*Believe me, when I learned what I would end up doing, I thought about leaving,*\" *he said, avoiding her gaze.* \"*There\'s an initiation thing they do, to make you prove your loyalty. It---no, I shouldn\'t talk about it.*\"

*A glimmer of fear had passed over his face just before he cut himself off, the kind of tiny gesture Yuma was getting more skilled at noticing. She didn\'t press him on it, though---she had no desire to know what wasn\'t being said.*

\"*So what?*\" *she asked, surprised at the slight sneer in her own voice.* \"*So you felt bad about what you did, and decided to make up for it? Free some girls and run over here? You know that doesn\'t make up for it at all, right?*\"

*Needless to say, Yuma\'s cortical self‐modifications had given her... a better appreciation of what it was that the Yakuza had intended to do to her before Oriko\'s intervention. It was a kind of innocence she knew she was never going to get back.*

*To her surprise, the former Yakuza lackey seemed to stiffen his spine slightly, reacting to her words with more force rather than cringing.*

\"*No, of course not,*\" *he said.* \"*Trust me; I\'ve thought about this. Even talked with the priest‐man here about it. It\'s just the start. The original idea was to get myself killed right afterward, but I ran instead. I was too scared to die, and you can\'t trust the cops to protect you from the Yakuza. That\'s laughable.*\"

*He paused for a moment, collecting his thoughts.*

\"*This is going to sound like a made‐up reason for my own cowardice, and maybe it is, but I\'ve come to understand that death isn\'t atonement. It\'s just a way out. If I live through this, I\'m going to find a way to do something else with my life, though I don\'t know how.*\"

*Yuma watched him as he paused, then looked at her, a new idea seeming to glimmer in his eyes.*

\"*You know,*\" *he said.* \"*If you\'re not really an angel, if you\'re just a girl, then maybe---maybe meeting you is destiny somehow, you know? I\'ve got to atone somehow, and---*\"

*Yuma shook her head decisively, interrupting whatever it was he was about to say.*

\"*I don\'t need anything that you can give,*\" *she said.* \"*I\'m fine; trust me.*\"

*Obviously she wasn\'t really \"fine\", and how exactly Oriko and the others would react to her disappearance nagged at the back of her mind. If she wanted to go back, she had an explanation ready: the other magical girl team had forced her to flee, and she had ended up trapped far outside their territory, forced to wait for an opportunity to return. It was a lie constructed from pieces of the truth, in just the way Oriko had taught her to lie, but she didn\'t know if it would* work.

*A part of her wondered if now might be the moment to try and make a radical change. One Yakuza guy with, presumably, a gun, wouldn\'t change anything, but if the guy had resources, then she could perhaps offer something if she threw herself on the mercy of one of the other magical girl teams. If---*

*She performed the mental equivalent of shaking her head at herself. She wasn\'t at that stage. Not yet.*

*Kurosawa sensed her moment of conflict, even as he seemed to deflate a little.*

\"*Are you sure?*\" *he asked.* \"*I mean, I guess I just want to make it up to you somehow.*\"

*Yuma let out a sigh, then dropped herself down on the couch next to him, feeling it creak even under her small weight.*

\"*Maybe you have,*\" *she said.* \"*That\'s an interesting point you made, that death isn\'t atonement. What convinced you of that?*\"

*Kurosawa blinked down at her, surprised by both her question and her action.*

\"*Well, I talked to Hashimoto‐san---er, that\'s the priest‐man here. I\'m not sure I buy the religion he\'s pitching, but I\'ve known him since I was a kid. He knows how to think about these things.*\"

\"*Says the guy who thought I was an angel,*\" *Yuma said.*

\"*Well, you did reattach my head, so...*\"

*Kurosawa shook his head at himself, chuckling.*

*Then his face turned serious again.*

\"*I feel like you asked the question because you have something to atone for. You\'re a kid, so I want to say that whatever it is, it can\'t be that bad, but you\'re no ordinary kid.*\"

*Yuma looked away, seeing not the worn wooden floors of the room, but the magical girl strapped to the examination chair with enchanted rope, face contorted in pain, while her team sneered.*

*She knew intellectually what the Yakuza did to girls, but she couldn\'t really imagine it. Could it be so much worse than what Oriko and others had done? How many times had it happened? How many had they killed?*

*The guilt weighed on her.*

\"*Hey!*\"

*The man shook her by the shoulder, startling her out of her reverie.*

*He leaned over to look at her.*

\"*You look like shit,*\" *he said.* \"*I can\'t believe someone like you would have something like that weighing you down. I won\'t ask, but you should go talk to Hashimoto‐san. He\'ll make you feel better.*\"

*Yuma looked the Yakuza man in the eye, then bowed her head, standing up from the chair, heading for the door. She didn\'t really want to talk to Hashimoto---but she sensed that she needed to do something, anything other than stew in her thoughts.*

\"*God, you and that blue girl---what are you? What could possibly be going on?*\" *Kurosawa asked, as she put her hand on the doorknob.*

*Yuma stood there for a moment. What indeed* was *going on? What was she doing here?*

*She thought about Miki Sayaka, that poor doomed girl. She had thought Sayaka crazy, but she was growing to realize that while the girl\'s reasons might have been poor, her solution was not. If there was no way out of a bad situation, it made a certain amount of sense to try to accomplish something on your way out.*

*She shook her head and stepped out, ignoring the question.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Reverend Hashimoto peered at her over the lenses of his bifocals, expression unreadable for a moment. He had been reading a newspaper when Yuma knocked, and though he had put the newspaper away, the glasses remained. The priest was a lot older than he appeared.*

*A moment later the glasses came off too, placed carefully onto the rough‐hewn wooden surface of his desk. He was using the gesture to conceal astonishment, Yuma thought. She very much doubted that when she had started talking about something that her friends had done, he had expected to hear anything like what she actually said.*

\"*For someone of your age, I would ordinarily think that you were exaggerating, or that perhaps you had somehow imagined it,*\" *he said. "*It would not be the first time. Yet I do not feel like that is the case here. How is it that a girl like you would come to be involved with those who are capable of torture?*\"

*Before Yuma could respond, he shook his head and held his hand up.*

\"*It is a rhetorical question,*\" *he said,* \"*and I very much doubt you would tell me regardless. Have you contacted the police?*\"

*She shook her head.*

\"*Impossible,*\" *she said.*

\"*Because they would hurt you?*\" *he said.*

\"*Because I could never prove it,*\" *she said,* \"*and the police could never catch them anyway. Because even talking about it would have far worse consequences than that. And yes, they might hurt me.*\"

*There was a moment of silence, and then Hashimoto opened his mouth to say something, but Yuma spoke first, looking down at the table:*

\"*And because I still love them. When my parents died, they were the ones who took me in. I feel guilty, because I love them, and because I allowed it to blind me to what was going on. I was smart enough to see it; I just chose not to.*\"

*It felt good to say out loud and, truth be told, she hadn\'t even fully understood it herself until she managed to verbalize it. It... made a lot more sense.*

*She had clearly thrown the good priest for a loop, though, because it was another long moment before she heard him suck in a breath and say:*

\"*That is the most worrying thing I have ever heard someone of your age say. You sound at least twice as old as you should, and blame yourself as if you were twice as old, too. You are too young to have to shoulder responsibility for something you failed to do. There is no expectation that you would intervene in anything.*\"

*Yuma glanced to one side. She knew he wouldn\'t understand, because he had no context in which to understand it.*

*She heard the priest sigh.*

\"*I would offer you forgiveness,*\" *he said,* \"*or God\'s forgiveness; that\'s usually enough. But in this case, I think what you\'re really looking for is your own forgiveness. As a priest, I am aware how poorly equipped I am to grant that.*\"

*Yuma looked up, and met the man\'s eyes. She saw that there was little there for her.*

*A moment later, she stood up, nodded at the man politely, and turned to leave. It wasn\'t really his fault, after all.*

*He caught her shoulder on the way out.*

\"*Listen, I have had a theory for a while now, about girls like you, girls who are supposed to be dead but still roam the streets. If you really have nowhere to go, there is room here for you, and perhaps we can talk further tomorrow.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*In the end Yuma took him up on the offer, if only because she didn\'t really want to do much of anything else. It would have been charitable to say that she really slept, though. She slept only in fits and starts, aggravated by the uncomfortable bed, the unfamiliar environment, and a general sense of unease. She thought---or dreamed---about Oriko, about her dead parents, about the magical girl strapped to a chair.*

*It seemed that every time she started to drift off, her mind would fabricate a vision or memory that would send her jolting awake.*

*There was Oriko standing in the dark, smiling, as broken soul gem fragments fell from her fingers.*

*There was a magical girl strapped to a chair, screaming---even though Yuma had never seen her scream. For a horrible moment it seemed to Yuma as if she were the one standing there, wielding a horrible instrument---and then she awoke again.*

*There was Oriko standing over the bodies of her parents, reaching down to do something. Her white gloves were stained red.*

*There was the priest, talking about dead girls roaming the street, girls who had died in fires. She saw a long‐haired girl standing silently in front of a burning church. She saw the same church, dark and gloomy, illuminated only by the dying, multi‐colored radiance of a few stained glass windows. The windows, though, looked odd for a church---not the usual assortment of the Christian god and his saints, but instead a collection of girls, in colorful and unusual costumes.*

*They looked oddly familiar, especially the green one, and Yuma squinted---*

*She jerked awake again. It took her a moment to reorient herself, picking up the pieces of her lost dream as she did so. For some reason, she had the sense that she had been on the verge of reaching something, something that filled her with both anticipation and dread. It felt unsatisfying.*

*She pulled her hand out, summoning an image of her soul gem to check its status. Not full, but not empty either. Generally stable, without the oozing darkness that had threatened it earlier that day. Just as it had been when she had gone to bed.*

*She supposed she owed the Yakuza man and the priest that much: they had stabilized her. It was Kurosawa who had pointed out that death was no form of atonement, and it was Hashimoto who had caused her to properly analyze the source of her guilt. She hadn\'t yet decided what to do, but she had reached one conclusion: she would at least refuse to die before she did it.*

*She was startled by a loud knock on her door.*

At this hour? *she thought. She had no idea exactly what time it was---there was no clock in the room, and the cell phone Oriko had given her was still in the mansion---but it couldn\'t have been anything other than the middle of the night.*

*She struggled out of her sheets, which had twisted into knots around her body, dropping out of bed. A sense of apprehension filled her---it didn\'t take magical girl instincts or an enhanced intelligence to know that a 3 AM knock on the door was rarely anything good. She had to be on her guard, and decided not to announce that she was coming to the door.*

*And yet when she opened the door, into a hallway that would have been impossible for any normal human to see in, there was no one there.*

*She should have been scared, even fearful, but something---perhaps the same something that had warned her to dodge at Oriko\'s mansion---told her she was in no danger.*

*Then she noticed the slip of paper on the floor.*

> *We know you\'re here. We\'re letting you stay, out of sympathy for your situation, but we won\'t tolerate you here forever. We\'ll give you twenty‐four hours.*
>
> #### --- *Kuroi Kana* 

> *PS: Have you ever thought about what* really *happened to your parents? I\'ve had a very interesting vision about them.*

*Yuma felt her heart skip a beat.*

*It was an enigmatic message, though it made its point clear enough. She---*

*She couldn\'t remember what had happened to her parents. That entire day was a blur, yet she had never even begun trying to examine it. Why?*

*She stood there for a moment, putting the pieces together in her mind. Now that the idea had occurred to her, it seemed absurdly obvious, as if something had been blocking her ability to see it, so that the memories were not merely missed, but ignored too. A blind spot for her mind, in other words.*

*A set of images entered her mind, images that until recently had been sealed out of her memory by Oriko\'s, or possibly Kirika\'s, magic. She saw Mikuru killing the Yakuza man Tanaka with an icicle, a memory she had always had. But she also saw her parents, still alive as the miasma began to dissipate. She saw Oriko telling Mikuru to kill them, and the blue‐clad magical girl smiling as she raised her spear of ice. She saw her parents\' pain, and their inability even to scream as Mikuru literally froze the blood in their veins, their faces turning into grotesque, inhuman caricatures.*

\"Satisfying,\" *Mikuru had said.* \"I like to think I do it in cold blood.\"

*Aina had laughed.*

*Yuma crumpled the paper in her fist. She needed to go back. There was a lot she needed to think about, and a lot she needed to do.*

*It seemed entirely reasonable for her to disappear into the night.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"You never said Kana mentioned anything to you about your parents,\" Mami said, giving Yuma the displeased look that had flashed on and off her face the entire conversation. \"Actually, I\'ve never heard about any of this.\"

\"Well, it wasn\'t exactly ever relevant,\" Yuma said, looking away carefully. \"Really, when would any of this ever come up?\"

\"Whenever we discussed Kana, for one,\" Mami said. \"It would have been one more piece of information. It would have been nice to know she spared your life when we were deciding how much to trust her.\"

\"Maybe,\" Yuma said, not really conceding the point. Privately, Yuma could only think that there were many things she had never told Mami.

\"I don\'t get why she didn\'t just kill you,\" MG said.

Yuma tilted her head to look at MG, while Mami shook her head sadly at nothing in particular.

\"It would have been the right thing to do,\" MG continued. \"As a healer, you were clearly very valuable to your team. Since I\'m sure Kana was just as interested as anyone else in destroying your team, she should have just killed you on the spot, or at least tried to capture or turn you.\"

Yuma shook her head.

\"I think she was trying to play the long game. Remember, Kana gets visions of the past. I\'ve never asked her what exactly she saw, but I\'ve always suspected it was enough to make her realize that I wasn\'t exactly loyal to Oriko anymore, and it might be better to make me go back than to kill me.\"

Mami shrugged.

\"I don\'t really buy that,\" she said. \"I know Kana, and Kana\'s team, and she might have just been showing pity on you. I wouldn\'t have killed you either, though I would have at least tried to capture you.\"

*You don\'t know her as well as I do,* Yuma thought privately.

\"Anyway, what confounds me about all of them is why no one ever tried to ask for help,\" Mami said, shaking her head. \"None of this would have happened if they would have just asked for help when things happened. Everyone had to have known I would have jumped at the chance to take Oriko down once and for all.\"

*Maybe that\'s why they didn\'t talk to you,* Yuma thought, though she again didn\'t say it out loud. A full‐out magical girl war would have been immensely bloody, especially against someone like Oriko. From what Kyouko had told her, the assembled magical girl teams of the city had made exactly that point to Mami, multiple times, after they finally agreed to cooperate to seal off the Southern Group in their region of the city. A blockade, rather than a war, on the hope that the Southern Group\'s insanity would eventually bring about their downfall.

It had worked, after all, but there were some things Mami refused to be rational about.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*It seems the other magical girl teams have decided to band together against us,*\" *Mikuru said, watching Oriko carefully to judge her reaction.* \"*Supposedly our borders will be absolutely sealed, on pain of immediate attack.*\"

\"*They don\'t have the balls,*\" *Aina scoffed, waving her hand dismissively.* \"*If they had* balls, *they\'d have attacked us on our own ground. They\'re scared.*\"

*Oriko sipped her tea calmly, acting as always as if she had foreseen everything.*

\"*Well, it was to be expected after recent events,*\" *she said.*

*Not so much as a glance in Yuma\'s direction. If Oriko suspected Yuma had seen what happened, she was doing a good job of hiding it. Her welcome back to Yuma when she finally returned had been effusive, swallowing Yuma\'s explanation for her absence without hesitation.*

\"*Yes, yes,* expected,\" *Aina said, beginning to pace slowly, impatiently.* \"*That\'s what you* always *say. And, you know, we all owe you and your future‐sight a lot, but I don\'t think you\'ll blame us for having doubts about how well the situation is going.*\"

*Yuma sucked in a breath, looking around the room for the reactions of the other girls. Kirika, leaning against the engraved wood paneling of the far wall, had stiffened slightly, just a little---she affected her usual nonchalance, but bristled at Aina\'s challenge to Oriko. Her body language signaled as much, her right hand behind her back tapping on the side‐table next to her with the fingers that should have been claws. Kirika was very prone to that kind of tic, the kind of tic that suggested she remembered very little of her life before she had gained her magical girl powers.*

*Something had happened to Kirika\'s memories, just as something had happened to Yuma\'s. She was sure of it. And just as Oriko\'s purposes were served by the hole in Yuma\'s memory, she was sure they were also served by the one in Kirika\'s. Everyone needed a rabidly loyal bodyguard, after all.*

*On the other side of the room, Mikuru stood in a neutral posture near the doorway into the main dining room, in front of a glass cabinet that contained Oriko\'s various china sets. She coolly watched the conversation, betraying no explicit reaction, but the very fact that she wasn\'t saying something to herself gave away that she was intently focused on what was going on.*

*In the middle of the room, in front of the small tea table Oriko was sitting at, Aina paced slowly. Her comment to Oriko had been extraordinarily restrained by Aina\'s standards, but it was clear that she meant what she had said. Besides the obvious body language, Yuma had heard the others complain about Oriko\'s withholding of information on countless occasions. It was inevitable that Aina was going to bring it out into the open. In Yuma\'s opinion, Aina\'s concerns were entirely valid, but she had no intention of openly siding with Aina in this discussion.*

*Yuma herself stood at Oriko\'s side, carrying a small set of documents in one arm. She was well aware of just how much she looked like Oriko\'s secretary at the moment, but that was part of the point. She needed to look as loyal and harmless as possible.*

*Finally, there was Oriko sitting at the small wooden table, continuing to look serene while looking Aina in the eye, though she was no longer actively drinking. Of the four other girls on the team, Oriko was the one Yuma still had considerable trouble reading. She was just always so... calm.*

\"*That is a valid concern,*\" *Oriko said.* \"*And I\'ve been quietly aware that I\'ve been mistreating you by not telling you as much as I know, but I hope I can convince you it was with good reason.*\"

*Oriko glanced down at her teacup for a moment, and for a moment she looked uncomfortable.*

\"*The simple fact of the matter is that while my visions of the future are extremely valuable, they are also not perfect. Specifically, my ability to map the consequences of my own actions is limited. Every time I map the future, I learn new information, and the effect of this information on my* own *actions has unpredictable consequences. I have done my best to infer which actions will produce the best future, but you can see how I am extremely reluctant to disturb a system in unpredictable ways. That includes the extremely unpredictable results of giving future information to someone* else. *There is a reason I have done my best to make my own behavior as consistent as possible, regardless of circumstances.*\"

*She peered at Aina with an unnerving gaze that even the notoriously fiery Aina cooled under.*

*Oriko turned her head away, picking up her teacup and sipping it again.*

\"*It is ironic, but to ensure that I myself do not accidentally change a good future, I must be very careful about mapping the future again after I have seen positive outcomes. The worse the futures I see, the more frequently I can map, because how much worse could I make it? But once I have achieved a good outcome, I am forced to deprive myself of my best power. Only in combat can I exercise my foresight with relative safety. I can only have this conversation safely because I have already foreseen it. You will simply have to trust me that the last time I checked, the future was still bright.*\"

\"*But* what *future?*\" *Mikuru asked, stepping forward to stand next to her girlfriend.* \"*You said you saw a future without the Yakuza, with crime destroyed. You said you could give us the power to make this happen, with the power of* all *magical girls, and the power to change the world. Where is* any *of that? How exactly are we going to do any of that, blockaded by all the other magical girl teams? I expected we would be ruling them by now; instead we\'re their prisoners!*\"

*It was the most impassioned thing Yuma had ever seen Mikuru say---more importantly, it was the first time she had ever heard exactly what promises Oriko had made to Mikuru and Aina, and the first time she had heard Oriko outline a limitation to her power.*

*Something occurred to her, something that wandering magical girl Clarisse had said to her:*

\"Oriko doesn\'t really see everything---she only sees what she tries to see.\"

*Yes... that comment made much more sense now. At the time Yuma had only thought it a feeble limitation---she had seen Oriko meditating on the future herself, and it had seemed that Oriko had plenty of time to cast her mind to all possibilities and all future events.*

*But those sessions had grown rarer and rarer over the past year, and Yuma wasn\'t even sure when Oriko had last tried to see the future.*

*Oriko smiled.*

\"*I\'m sorry I can\'t say more,*\" *she said,* \"*but you have to believe me that your future is still on the way. All of that. We* will have the power to do that. If only you could see what I see.*\"

*If what Oriko implied was true, then she had found a future that was satisfying to her, and if it was the future Mikuru was promised, it was horrifying. A future where Mikuru and Oriko had the power they had been seeking when they tortured that girl, the power to use the magic of other magical girls, the power to destroy the Yakuza and crime, and to change the world. The idea of anyone like Mikuru or Aina or Kirika with that kind of power turned her stomach, even if their first targets were the Yakuza.*

*Yuma looked at Oriko\'s rapturous face, one which only amplified the horror in Yuma\'s heart. The look was alien on Oriko\'s face, on anyone\'s face, matched only by the look on Mikuru\'s face while killing her victims.*

*She remembered again her parents\' death, and it took nearly all of her self‐control to keep from gagging on the spot.*

*They had been terrible parents, more terrible even than she had realized at the time, but she didn\'t think they had deserved* that. More importantly, she could see the cost of letting the Southern Group have the power they sought. She could understand the pattern of grisly murders she had found in the recent history of Mitakihara City---bodies frozen alive, or else roasted alive, in cases the police had never solved. It all aligned: the murders had started roughly five years ago, and ended about a year before Yuma\'s own contract.*

*They had been criminals, low‐life thugs, or worse. But...*

*Yuma looked around carefully, at Aina and Mikuru nodding finally, acquiescing to Oriko\'s soothing assurances, with what she suspected was a sizable assist from Kirika\'s magic, and knew the truth.*

*The Southern Group had become what they wanted to destroy, and had to be destroyed themselves. And if she couldn\'t bear to live without Oriko, then she had to go with them.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"You tried to kill them!\" MG interjected, looking at Yuma with a fresh set of shocked eyes.

Yuma looked back at the intensely green eyes of her pupil, one carved with the I/O symbol in emerald green and the other deep in its vibrant softness.

She allowed herself a momentary pang in her heart. This kind of reaction made MG all too human, more so than many alleged flesh‐and‐blood humans, even more than Yuma herself had been, ever since the events of so long ago.

\"Not what the history books say, is it?\" Yuma said a moment later, closing her eyes and drinking deeply from the giant cup of coffee in front of her. \"There\'s more; save your thoughts for later.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*It took a lot of thought, a lot of preparation, and a lot of luck for Yuma to get the pieces in place.*

*The first step was to protect the integrity of her own thoughts. If Oriko or Kirika were capable of wholesale blocking her memories, there was no telling what they could do in terms of mind‐reading. Oriko had already given her training to protect her from the likes of Tanaka Yui, but she needed more than simply the ability to resist parapsychology---she needed to be able to do it without the telepath knowing, and ideally to do it all the time, so she could never be caught off‐guard. Not even while asleep.*

*Down that general line of paranoid thinking lay madness, she well understood, but she felt it was necessary. Fortunately she had plenty of time alone in Oriko\'s lab to meditate and work on magic. It took a few months, but she eventually* got *it. It involved cultivating a certain style of thinking, of making sure she was always thinking about at least two things at once, and, whenever one of the lines of thought was too sensitive, making sure that the other line of thought was louder, more powerful.*

*It wasn\'t so much an active telepathic defense as a distraction, playing on the expectations of mind‐readers. There was no good way to test it, but she was sure it would work.*

*There was also no good way to use it while asleep, but she solved that problem by simply not sleeping. It was a surprisingly trivial exertion for a magical girl like her to make, once she knew how. The answer was to simply* not sleep *and then \"heal\" the damage. This trick she could even share with Oriko and the others, earning more trust and applause from the group.*

*It gave her more time to work, anyway.*

*Once that was accomplished, it was necessary to protect herself as much as possible from the certainty of Oriko\'s future‐sight. It was true that nowadays Oriko was avoiding any deep probes into the future, clearly certain that the timeline was on the preferred track, and Yuma would have to make special exertions to unseat it. There was a strong chance that Oriko had already foreseen Yuma\'s plan, so Yuma had to tap into the only fount of uncertainty in Oriko\'s visions---Oriko herself. Any information leak had the potential to shift the timeline, so Yuma stuck as closely to her* Onee‐chan *as possible, referring as frequently to future events as she dared, gleaning whatever she could off of subtle changes in body language, small turns of phrase. She then spread whatever information she got as widely as she could, dropping it casually in conversation with Kirika and Mikuru. She could only hope that the ripples she introduced would upset the timeline enough.*

*This was the riskiest part of her strategy. She might overplay her hand at any moment and trigger another attempt by Oriko to read the future---and the closer Yuma\'s intended future got, the riskier. Even if Yuma did nothing at all, Oriko might still do it---and ruin everything.*

*Her head hurt just trying to think about that kind of reverse causality, but she could tell that there was no avoiding that particular roll of the dice. She watched Oriko and the others carefully, watching for any sign that she had been scented. She had a backup plan---an evacuation to beg the mercy of Sakura Kyouko and her group---and on more than one occasion almost started it, her hair‐trigger paranoia overreacting to the smallest of coincidences.*

*The third part of her plan was by far the simplest. While it was possible that Yuma might be able to kill one of the others with a surprise attack, there was no way she could possibly overwhelm all of them alone. She needed more power than she could achieve with just her soul gem and magical girl frame.*

*So she began making overloaded grief cubes, storing them carefully in pockets around town, as well‐concealed and protected as she could manage. It was inevitable that some of them would erupt into demon hordes, but these were easy to write off as run‐of‐the‐mill demon attacks. When the time came, she would collect as many of them as she could in one grand sweep of the city, keep them suppressed with her magic, then drop all of them at once on the Southern Group while they were distracted with the hunt. If necessary she would attack them herself, but she hoped to avoid that and watch from a distance.*

*Finally, the day arrived, long‐awaited and long‐dreaded.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The clusters of grief cubes pressed against Yuma\'s body felt---well, not warm, but uncomfortably* present, *exerting a constant, unrelenting pressure on her mind, like a phantom limb that was always, unrelievedly, itchy.*

*It took at least as much attention for her to keep the far‐too‐concentrated grief from spilling outward and inevitably spawning demons. She had practiced, multiple times, until she was confident she could handle so many at once, but nothing could have prepared her for the amount of drain it was imposing on her. She could only hope she could get to her destination quickly enough, and without being detected.*

*She had worried and agonized about her decision every step of the way, over the planning, the execution, and even whether or not she would do it at all. Now that she was finally here, however, she found herself unaccountably serene. The die was cast now, and whatever happened, happened. She was even prepared for her own failure and capture---one advantage to having one\'s soul compacted into a soul gem was that it made ending one\'s existence palatably... well, easier to do.*

*She had the courage of someone already dead, she thought. Someone who should have already been dead, and who expected to be dead soon.*

*She leapt across the rooftops, honing in on the flashes of magic that signaled the rest of the Southern Group fighting a large group of demons, not even noticing the rain that poured endlessly from the sky, soaking into skin, costume, and concrete alike.*

*Today was an opportune time to attempt what she had come to think of as her personal project. All four other members of the team were out hunting an unusually large horde, large enough to cause Oriko to request all hands on deck, except Yuma. The demon spawn was located fairly deep in their territory, deep enough that there was unlikely to be interference from the other magical girl teams, yet close enough to the borders that they could intervene if they realized the demon spawn was operating out of control. Finally, the demon spawn had happened in an industrial district, rather than a residential district, so Yuma could summon a tremendous amount of demons relatively free from the worry that she would accidentally be killing innocent bystanders---though it was inevitable that she would be endangering at least a few.*

*Just as important, Yuma could no longer wait, not now that her preparations were complete. Every passing day increased the risk that Oriko would detect a shift in the timeline and act to snuff it out. In no way could Yuma claim to understand the intricacies of Oriko\'s future‐sight, but from what little she did know, the intrinsic reverse causality meant that there were only two likely outcomes---either Oriko would never notice, and Yuma would succeed, or Oriko* would *notice, and the plot would be over before it began.*

*Mind‐twistingly, the implications of both the forward and reverse logic were the same---the sooner she acted, the better.*

*So she had braced herself, filled her own mind with a magically‐induced calm, and set out into the stormy night, recovering the grief cube stashes she had so carefully distributed across the city.*

*She let out a breath, feeling the bright flare of Hinata Aina\'s magic dance through her soul. She couldn\'t possibly attack directly---Oriko would detect that long before it happened. The only possible attack was by deception---dropping off overloaded grief cubes in an out‐of‐the‐way location, so that they would show up merely as a furious, fresh demon horde. Oriko would anticipate it, but Yuma\'s fingerprints wouldn\'t show up immediately, not if she kept herself out of the way and concealed.*

*The rest depended on how well she could execute the plan.*

*Hinata Aina was isolated from the others in an attempt to cut off part of the demon spawn, as always confident in her own abilities, and the abilities of Oriko\'s future‐sight to anticipate any threats. A bit of luck: Aina was already straining her soul gem, pushing her limits to finish off her section of the miasma. Yuma could feel Aina\'s signal pulsate with the effort. Only a true veteran would dare such a maneuver, confident that no new demons were going to spawn.*

*Yuma landed on a streetlamp, releasing her first clutch of grief cubes onto the street below. One small poke---and there, they had begun activating.*

*She vaulted herself to the next rooftop and continued, not even looking back at the massive miasma she could feel materializing almost instantly behind her. This particular group would assuredly head for Hinata Aina, drawn by the need to support the already existing demons against Aina\'s attacks.*

Hinata‐san! *Yuma heard Oriko yell over unshielded broad‐band telepathy.* There\'s going to be a massive horde of demons inbound on you extremely soon. Within thirty seconds, I think. Regroup immediately.

What? *Aina replied.* I\'m a little *busy* at the moment, if you can\'t tell! I\'m going to be tied up here. I\'d rather you come to me.

We will try, *Oriko responded.* Something is wrong with the miasma. It is far too powerful.

Why didn\'t you notice? *Aina demanded.*

*Yuma tuned the conversation out as much as she could, though she allowed it to linger on the edge of her awareness. She couldn\'t truly ignore it, because there was too much of a chance it contained information vital to her project, but she very much didn\'t want to hear the confused or distressed reactions of her erstwhile teammates. Only someone who would gloat in their downfall could have enjoyed something like that.*

*A short while later, she reached a location she judged to be the right spot to separate Aina from the rest of the group. A few grief cube packages here would spawn a tremendous concentration of demons that would completely prevent the others from reinforcing Aina. She just needed to---*

*She paused mid‐action, spotting a scraggly‐looking man shuffling along the street below.*

*In the rain? At this hour? Practically in the middle of a demon attack?*

*Yuma hesitated for a long, painful moment, feeling the soul gem signals of Oriko and the others growing slowly closer. She had practiced hiding her soul gem signal for months now, both from demons and magical girls, but the longer she stood here, the more she tempted fate.*

*She dropped her packages, exerting her magic to summon the demons that lay dormant within. She was too far invested to change her plans now, and it made no difference whether or not she could see the potential victims of her actions---there was certainly more than one on‐duty security guard in her area of attack, probably at least a dozen.*

*She continued on, feeling guilty at the palpable relief she felt no longer having to keep all those grief cubes under control.*

Damn it! Where are these all coming from? *Kirika said, before swearing more colorfully than Yuma had thought possible.*

We\'re coming! *Mikuru thought.* Just hang on!

*Yuma could almost taste the desperation in Mikuru\'s message.*

*As she continued among the rooftops, she weighed her options. She had expected that the situation would present her with opportunities that she would have to rapidly exploit, but she hadn\'t expected to get as lucky as she had. However, she now saw two distinct ways to proceed. She could hope that Mikuru would get carried away in her desperation and push too far away from Oriko and Kirika, as she was already starting to, and take advantage of it by using her grief cubes to cut* her *off as well---or she could take a more proactive approach, one that took advantage of a stratagem she had planned for the occasion.*

*She decided that being proactive was better than reactive, especially when she could use it to greatly increase the amount of timeline distortion she might be causing. Funny, that those kinds of causality considerations would be so much more important than anything else.*

*It would take delicacy to accomplish the next steps, then.*

*She maneuvered as close as she dared to Mikuru, Kirika, and Oriko, stopping behind a squat ventilation turbine on top of an adjoining factory building. Her practice at maintaining magical stealth had availed her well so far---the miasma was very thick here, but the demons had failed to notice her, and she was now close enough to even see the three girls, cutting through the demons with desperate efficiency, unable to make headway fast enough to reach Aina.*

*Yuma felt a pang of emotion cut into her heart, triggered by the look of genuine anguish she saw on Mikuru\'s face.*

Steady, *she thought.* Not now.

*A moment later she felt it fade away, crushed behind a veil of numbness. She had not realized until that moment just how much she was leaning on the crutch of mind magic to keep herself focused. It was unsustainable, obviously---but sustainability wasn\'t the point. She just had to get it over with, and then she could let her emotions take her into the darkness.*

*Yuma allowed herself the luxury of a single breath, and then opened a private telepathic channel with Mikuru.*

Mikuru! *she thought, hoping she was channeling her distress into an acceptable acting job.* I\'m glad I got here in time. I have to warn you about Oriko!

*Mikuru was far too disciplined, and far too embroiled in combat, to try to look around for Yuma. Instead, the blue‐armored girl dodged around a demon laser, leveraged herself off the side of a building, and hurled an icicle straight through the eyes of one of the oncoming monstrosities.*

*But there were still more, many more.*

What are you talking about? *Mikuru thought back, mental voice strained.* Where are you? I don\'t know what you\'re doing here, but we need you!

*As Yuma had hoped, Mikuru kept the conversation in a private channel, rather than broadcasting it to the group as would be useful.*

I can\'t reach you! *Yuma thought.* But that\'s just it! I found evidence on Oriko\'s computer. She made a deal with the other teams. The plan for the future *doesn\'t* involve either of you two. *I think she means for you to die here.*

*It was a brazen half‐truth, one that drew half its power from dark implications Yuma had derived from some of Oriko\'s veiled statements, and the rest from discussions Yuma had overheard between Mikuru and Aina.*

*Yuma saw Mikuru jerk mid‐blow, by now quite far from Kirika and Oriko, who were visibly hesitating about charging through the demons at Mikuru\'s desperate pace. She braced for Mikuru to start questioning Oriko openly, and hoped the girl didn\'t realize the inconsistency between Yuma implying she was stuck behind demons and the fact that Yuma\'s magic wasn\'t showing up on radar.*

*Instead, another telepathic voice tore into their mindscape.*

Mikuru! Oriko! I\'m sorry. I can\'t hold out here any longer. My soul gem is nearly gone. I\'m not going to make it in time. I\'ll try to do what I can.

No! Wait--- *Mikuru began abortively.*

*She was interrupted by a brilliant red glare about two blocks away, bright enough to burn Yuma\'s eyes, bright enough to make the clouds and night seem, briefly, irrelevant.*

*It grew upward, seeming to burn a hole in the sky itself, the flames swirling into a vortex that seemed almost alive, immune to the rain that even now continued to fall. Yuma started, realizing abruptly that the rain really* wasn\'t *falling anymore.*

*She felt the wind turn and gain force, heading towards the flame, and she felt the rain again, beating into her back, pulled in from blocks away by the rising superheated column of air. Funny, that the miasma could blot out so much of the world, but never affected the rain.*

*Even the demons in the area stopped, turning to look at the vortex.*

No! *Mikuru screamed in anguish, as Yuma forced herself to turn away.*

Remember me, *Aina thought, so wistful she almost seemed like a different person entirely.* That\'s all I ever wanted. A final gift.

*A crashing boom sounded behind her, and the force of the detonation against her back nearly sent her---a magical girl!---to the floor.*

*When Yuma opened her eyes again, the red glow still permeated the world around her. Looking up, she saw that even the storm clouds had broken, forced away by the power of the blast, revealing stars and moon above.*

*She turned, half‐expecting to see a crater in the middle of Mitakihara, but instead the demons in the entire block were gone, miasma and all. The buildings in the area still stood, serenely undamaged, protected by the mysteries of miasma and masquerade. They seemed crisp and clear in the moonlight.*

*A moment later the clouds closed back in, the rain beginning again, and the miasma reformed, returning the area to a dreamy, surreal quality. Yuma realized that if she didn\'t act quickly, the area Aina had been in would serve as a clear avenue of escape for the others.*

\"*You* bitch!\" *Mikuru screamed, drawing Yuma\'s attention back to the drama below.*

*The ice‐armored mage glared at Oriko with unfathomable rage, a hemisphere of ice rising with a rumble out of the ground behind her, blocking for now the attacks of the newly refocused demons.*

\"*What are you doing?*\" *Oriko asked in genuine shock, raising the floating spheres she used as a weapon in front of her for defense. Kirika had already shifted her stance to face menacingly at Mikuru, claws drawn. Even so, she betrayed her worry, glancing around at the demons still bearing down on them. It was a nightmare, being forced to face down a grief‐stricken former teammate in the middle of a demon spawn.*

*Oriko\'s eyes lost their focus for a moment, not even acknowledging Mikuru\'s stare, and Yuma could see that she was probing the future, just a little deeper than her usual combat focus.*

\"*Ah, I see,*\" *Oriko said, with the tone of one who had been enlightened.* \"*I have been a fool.*\"

*Then she turned her head, looking up at the top of the factory, directly at where Yuma had pulled her head back behind cover to avoid being spotted. Yuma knew, though, that it didn\'t matter anymore whether she was seen by Oriko or not. She* knew.

*Oriko didn\'t sound worried, though, and Yuma felt the icy tendril of fear shoot itself through her heart.*

What am I doing? *she finally thought, collapsing onto her knees on the rooftop.* I---

*She was interrupted, though, by a surge of magic nearby, powerful enough that she flinched, expecting an immediate onslaught, before sticking her head back out to see what was going on.*

\"*Shit!*\" *she heard Kirika say, and for a moment she couldn\'t understand what all the magic she was feeling was being* spent on. *All she saw was that Kirika had summoned her aura of slowed time, an ominous black shell of magic that enshrouded the area. Within it, Mikuru stood completely still behind a wall of ice, hands clasped together, not even trying to move. Yuma had difficulty understanding what Kirika was worried about.*

*A moment later she felt the air shift again, threatening to blow her away, and so cold it felt like her skin was freezing on the spot.*

*Then the black shell of Kirika\'s magic shimmered, wavered---and froze into a sphere of ice, tinged with the eerie blue glint of Mikuru\'s magic.*

The rain! *Yuma realized. With time slowed, the water had accumulated at the boundary of Kirika\'s magical aura, the aura that Mikuru knew Kirika would instinctively cast in defense.*

*It had turned into a tomb, one that Mikuru could trap Kirika and Oriko in. But what was she---?*

*In the darkness, it had taken her a moment to peer through the shimmering ice, and through the impurities that ruined the transparency of even the purest rainwater. Despite having a magical girl\'s vision, she had difficulty seeing what was going on, even with the blue shimmer of Mikuru\'s magic to aid her.*

*She saw Kirika in the middle of lunging forward with her claws, trying to reach Mikuru, but frozen in the ice, mid‐action. Yuma could see how it had worked---low temperature, the water already in the air combined with ice summoned from Mikuru\'s magic. The combination of the two would, through surprise and the physical block of Mikuru\'s ice wall, prevent Kirika from stopping the event in time. The better move would have been for Kirika to run instead---but that simply wasn\'t in her nature.*

*Why had Mikuru frozen herself, though? Perhaps there was simply no way for her to perform the skill without using Kirika\'s water shell, or perhaps she simply hadn\'t wanted to bother. Yuma could empathize with that, at least.*

*A moment later, Yuma saw the blue glow to the ice fade, and felt Mikuru\'s soul gem disappear from her mental radar. She knew then that Mikuru must have burned out her power performing her last feat.*

*As she watched, the blue‐clad girl vanished, disappearing into the void, along with much of the ice she had summoned, though the outer shell was still intact. A moment later, Kirika, who had been suspended in midair, fell to the floor and---like a statue knocked off its pedestal---broke into pieces.*

*Yuma grimaced, feeling Kirika\'s soul gem usage continue to spike. She wasn\'t sure even she could have healed the damage---the massive damage that accompanied being totally frozen, cell membranes ruptured, blood vessels snapped---*

*She put a hand to her mouth, barely managing to suppress the urge to vomit, as a wave of nausea overtook her. Why had she stopped to think about it?* Stupid.

*But what about Oriko? Her soul gem was still active, but Yuma couldn\'t* see *her.*

*Her eyes were drawn to the far end of the ice shell, where the ice was unusually murky---so murky that Yuma couldn\'t see through it, or see what was inside.*

*As if on cue, a loud cracking noise sounded as the recovering demon population attacked what seemed to be the only still‐living magical girl, burning white beams streaking towards the shell of ice, which had begun to break.*

*And then, a moment later, the ice shattered open almost explosively, Oriko jumping straight upwards in an aura of pure white magic, surrounded by the metal spheres she used as protection.*

How did she live through that? *Yuma thought, staggered.*

*Yuma pulled out her remaining packets of grief cubes, three in all. There was, at this point, no reason left to hold onto them. At the moment, all they represented was a drain on her magic.*

*She tossed all three packets over the edge of the building, triggering them awake, and* ran.

*There was no way Oriko could survive so many demons, even with future‐sight, she thought. Not without backup. All Yuma had to do was get out of the area---*

*She stopped, only a block from where she had been.*

*Where was she going? Wasn\'t the plan for this to be the end? In that case, what point was there in leaving?*

*She looked down at her gloved hand, at the embroidered hammer she used as a weapon. Her vision blurred, and she felt herself releasing the iron grip she held over her own thoughts and emotions. It was finally---*

You\'re not even going to watch? *Oriko thought, her* Onee‐chan\'s voice filtering into her mind.* After all, you put a lot of effort into this. You can\'t even stand to see your own work? That\'s not the girl I trained.

*Yuma tightened her grip on her hammer, biting her lip.*

*The rational part of her mind knew she was being manipulated, but it was no longer in control. She couldn\'t bear to watch, but she couldn\'t bear* not *to watch either.*

*A moment later, she turned around and headed back towards Oriko. Part of her was tempted to release the hold on her magic emissions, to allow the local demons to sense her and give her something to fight, but she still had enough presence of mind to realize Oriko wasn\'t dead* yet, and she needed to wait, just a little longer.*

*What was she doing? With her parents dead, Oriko and her mansion was the only world she knew, full of food and light and books. Why was she destroying it?*

*She swallowed the nagging thought, landing on the edge of a roof and peering over it at the position of Oriko\'s soul gem. Her line of sight was blocked by another building, but she could see a circle of demons forming, and knew that Oriko, with her focus on defensive magic, couldn\'t break out.*

*Yuma stared for a long moment, hearing her own breath ring in her ears. Was this it, then? It seemed... so empty.*

*Finally she stood straight up, allowing the bright scent of her magic to shine against the dark winds of the miasma, and felt the attention of some of the demons turn towards her. She didn\'t really know what she was doing.*

*Oriko\'s soul gem was dimming rapidly.*

*Yuma screamed, releasing all the rage, hatred, fear, and frustration that lurked in her soul. For months now, she had been unable to reveal her true thoughts, always on guard, never asleep, always fearful that her own* soul gem *might betray her true emotions. She hadn\'t even had the outlet of demon hunts to release her feelings, not with the rest of the team providing her grief cubes in exchange for helping run some of Oriko\'s projects.*

*Oriko. Onee‐chan. Puppet‐master.*

*As she dove down towards the tremendous horde of demons, she reflected that she hadn\'t lied to Mikuru, not really. The way Oriko spoke about the future to Yuma had made it clear, intentionally or not, that Oriko had no expectation of Mikuru or Aina living to see it.*

*As she fell, she felt the weight of her hammer increasing sharply. It wouldn\'t increase how fast she fell, but it ensured that when she landed, the impact would be cataclysmic.*

*She kept her eyes open as she shattered the ground, watching the green shockwave of her magic smash outward, tearing apart ground and building and demon alike. Among the upturned soil and ruined pavement, the broken bodies of dead demons dissolved, raining grief cubes onto the ground. Around her the miasma weakened, just a little, and she knew she was making a dent.*

*The other demons in the area started to turn towards her, realizing that the bigger threat was not the nearly broken magical girl they had surrounded, but this newcomer, whose power was fresh and whose soul---well, if not unsullied, at least was not completely black.*

*Yuma stayed constantly in motion, refusing to give them a chance to react, or to get a fix on her position. She danced from cluster to cluster, swinging her hammer with wild abandon, deleting, adding, and deleting mass again, healing any injuries she received immediately with copious magic, just as Oriko had taught her. Yuma was more valuable as a healer than in combat, but when she* did *enter combat, it was a berserker‐style that was most effective. It had always seemed ironic to her, but at this particular moment it seemed only appropriate.*

*She fought effectively enough that she was even able to stop, finally, breathing heavily and feeling her soul gem begin to strain. All enemies in her vicinity were dead, leaving her in the gaping eye of a veritable storm of demons that threatened to close in on her at any moment.*

*Dragging her hammer along the ground as she walked, she headed for her goal. What she was doing was madness, she knew, but for some reason it only felt natural, as if it were the culmination of all she had worked for.*

*She found Oriko lying supine in the alleyway where she had fallen when Yuma first dove off the roof. Her costume was soaked in an increasingly large pool of blood, and it was clear from the angle of her limbs that she was in no condition to do much else than lie there and try to heal.*

*Still, though, it was striking that Oriko made no attempt to try to move as Yuma approached.*

I can still heal her, *Yuma thought.*

*It would cost a substantial portion of what power she still had, but she could do it. A part of her still longed to.*

\"*Don\'t even think about healing me,*\" *Oriko said, peering at Yuma with cold eyes, startling her with the power of her voice.* \"*It wouldn\'t save us from all these demons. You might as well keep your power for yourself. You did this, after all---I\'m going to have to insist you see it through.*\"

*Yuma stood there for a moment, peering down at her mentor. What was it about what Oriko said that disturbed her so much? The implied taunt? Or the fact that, even now, Oriko was still telling her to save her power?*

*Finally, she collapsed to her knees next to Oriko, grabbing hold of the other girl\'s collar.*

\"*Why?*\" *she demanded, asking the one question whose answer she didn\'t know.* \"*Why me? What\'s special about* me?\"

*Her* Onee‐chan *laughed, full of all the mirth and charm Yuma had come to love her for.*

\"*You even have to ask?*\" *Oriko said, eyes glimmering.* \"*Look around you! Look at what you\'ve done! Who else could have done better?*\"

\"*What do you mean?*\" *Yuma demanded, gritting her teeth.*

\"*Tell me, did you enjoy it?*\" *Oriko asked.* \"*Isolating us, turning us against each other, stacking the deck in your favor? Look at you! You\'ve truly learned everything I\'ve taught you. No one else was capable of destroying us. No one.*\"

\"*Are you saying---*\"

\"*Oh don\'t shake me so hard, child,*\" *Oriko said, grabbing Yuma\'s wrist with one hand.* \"*My neck is broken, you know. If I were human, you might kill me, moving my head like that. I\'d rather last a bit longer here, if you don\'t mind.*\"

*Oriko\'s eyes lost her focus, and began peering into the distance, staring into the infinite abyss of the future.*

\"*It is oppressive for someone like me, gifted with future‐sight, to be incapable of divining my own future,*\" *Oriko whispered, grasping Yuma\'s arm with inhuman strength.* \"*But that\'s just how it is right now. I should be able to see it, but I can\'t. Not now, not ever. I can\'t see past the eternal veil. I don\'t know what happens to me after my death. Can it truly be nothing?*\"

*Oriko\'s grip loosened.*

\"*I hoped that maybe at the end, the darkness might lift, just a little,*\" *she said, smiling slightly.* \"*But I guess not.*\"

*Yuma felt water drip down her cheeks and realized that it was not the rain.*

*Oriko reached up for Yuma\'s cheek to dab the tears with her sleeve, the one that was clean of blood.*

Oh, child, *she thought.* You thought we were monsters, but you\'re not any different than we were. I will always love you, my very own monster, despite the things I did to you, and you did to me.

*A long pause.*

But maybe you *are* better than us, *Oriko thought.* After all, I still have to help you with this last step.

*Oriko raised her other hand, her soul gem in its palm, once luminously white, but now almost---but not quite---dark black.*

*Before Yuma could react, the bloodied hand spasmed, gripping shut on the soul gem, the shards of Oriko\'s soul shattering explosively, reminiscent of all of Yuma\'s nightmares about Oriko killing the girl she had tortured.*

*And then it was over, and there was only a dead teenager lying in her own blood, and another kneeling next to her, heart empty.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"So you killed them,\" MG said, looking down into her drink with her one green eye, unnaturally luminescent. She seemed not so much shocked anymore as simply numb, as if there were too many things to be shocked at simultaneously.

\"Yes,\" Yuma said, \"though to this day I don\'t know whether Oriko wanted me to kill them, or whether she even intended for it to happen. She certainly didn\'t seem very disappointed in me.\"

\"And at the very end, she could certainly tell you were going to live,\" Mami said, sipping her tea. \"That was probably why she told you to save your power.\"

Yuma looked down into her own drink. This was the kind of revelation that Mami usually didn\'t take very well, but at this point this was centuries‐old news to her, even if Yuma had not previously shared her memories in *quite* so much detail. Mami did a lot better when she had time to think about it, but the initial shock...

Yuma sighed.

\"It was very good of you all to be able to trust me, even after I told you what happened. I was afraid you wouldn\'t, for a long, long time. No one likes a girl capable of turning on her team like that.\"

\"You had extenuating circumstances,\" Mami said, watching Yuma carefully over her cup of tea. \"I can\'t say I wouldn\'t have done the same against someone like Oriko, though I don\'t think I would have been able to pull it off like you had. You did everyone a big favor.\"

Mami blinked, and set down the tea, seemingly done with what she was saying.

*No one who did what she did deserves to live, Yuma,* Mami thought, without changing expressions. *It doesn\'t matter if you had to be the one to deliver justice, or how you had to do it. There is a difference between being one who starts it, and the one who* finishes *it.*

Internally, Yuma sighed. If only Mami could see *everything* that way... She couldn\'t, though. No one could. Not even Yuma, not all the time.

What could she say? That to her killing Oriko and the others would be like Mami killing Sayaka and the others? That wasn\'t the same, and she knew it. What would saying that even achieve?

\"*She\'s being unfair,*\" MG thought, relaying the thought into Yuma\'s cortical implants. \"*It bothers you, but* I *understand.*\"

Yuma looked over at her protégé, or daughter, or whatever it was, and found the AI looking back at her.

\"*Someday, you might have to run your position without me,*\" Yuma thought. \"*When that happens, you\'ll be more ready. And you won\'t have had to learn the hard way.*\"

\"*I understand,*\" MG thought. \"*I think.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko gasped, finally awakening from her dream within a dream. Before her, the basin was again filled with still, placid water.

\"Fire and ice,\" said the voice of the Goddess. \"Like this basin of water, life itself always dances on the edge between too hot and too cold. A crisis is coming. In the original English, crisis was once used to indicate a time of great import, one that can change many things, for better or worse. So too shall it be. But I do believe you now have a body to return to.\"

*Wait!* Ryouko thought, but the words themselves died stillborn on her lips, as the water in front of her began to boil...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asami fiddled with her soul gem ring.

It was a nervous habit she had developed recently, a tic that showed itself whenever she found herself faced with an unpleasant situation. She knew it was there, but she found it difficult to suppress the urge, especially now that she no longer had Ryouko\'s soul gem on her finger. The sensation of something missing seemed always to be with her.

She had turned the gem over to the scientists at the Prometheus Institute for the revival process. They had estimated it would be done within the day, but there had since been unspecified \"delays\", and now she was looking at another three days of waiting. She was paranoid, and Kyouko had even indirectly confirmed to her that she had plenty of reason to be paranoid, but... Ryouko\'s father himself was heading the revival team, and if anyone had a reason to do a good job, he did.

As for the unpleasant situation she was facing, *that* was a consequence of the fact that she was back on Earth at all, a fact that even Ryouko\'s mother had found puzzling. Kuroi Nakase, her sister, Meiqing, and Sacnite had returned to Earth as well, but they were staying in visitor accommodations elsewhere in the city.

Leaving Asami, very reasonably, back with her parents, where she didn\'t want to be.

\"You know, I\'m not sure it\'s a good thing those security agents are gone,\" her mother said, trying to peer into Asami\'s eyes. \"They were awfully nice, and you know, I did feel more secure with them here. We were so scared for you, after that explosion at the lab. I can\'t believe you two decided to go back out there after something like that. I would have at least spent some time recovering.\"

The security detail---actually two rival security details from Ryouko\'s confusing Matriarchy heritage---had followed Ryouko\'s soul gem to Prometheus, where Asami genuinely wished them the best in protecting Ryouko. She was glad they weren\'t with *her,* though; the two groups were hardly friendly with each other, and had spent nearly all their time openly trying to shove each other out of the picture, while simultaneously buttering up everyone affiliated with Ryouko with almost groan‐inducing friendliness.

This included the junior magical girl team leads---one per each team, both hardly older than Asami herself---*actually shoving each other* in the doorway when they had first arrived on Eurydome, an affair that Meiqing had to intervene to stop. It had been comedic at the time, but the whole thing had quickly gotten tiresome.

Her mother quietly shoved more chicken cutlets onto her plate, almost as a matter of course. Asami had learned to give up arguing with her mom about food. Her mother clearly felt comforted by the gesture, and it really wouldn\'t hurt her to eat it---and if Asami were being honest, she really had trouble eating much at home nowadays, since she was always struck by the urge to leave the table as soon as possible.

Asami glanced at her younger brother, Riki, who she sensed looking at her. He immediately cast his eyes away from her. He had been... rather bemused to learn that the girl he had had a crush on had become his sister\'s girlfriend. Well, he had never been the most perceptive of brothers.

\"For me it\'s the opposite,\" Asami\'s father said, from the other side of the table, cutting into a piece of meat. \"I\'m glad they\'re here if they\'re necessary, but the fact that they\'re necessary only makes me more worried. I\'m worried about your safety.\"

\"I\'m sure she\'ll be fine, dear,\" her mother said, placing one hand lovingly on her father\'s arm. It was the kind of casual contact that signified a thriving relationship---Asami would know, having secretly gobbled all the relationship advice writing she could.

It also made her vaguely sick to her stomach. She remembered well when her father had hardly ever been home, when her mother had been a terrible cook, and when the two of them had screamed at each other regularly at the dinner table.

She would have been crazy to miss that, and didn\'t, but...

At the heart of her wish to keep her parents together had been a desire for a normal loving family, of the kind you could find in stereotyped dramas, and the wish had kindly fulfilled her desires.

It took her a while to notice, but she missed who they used to be, defects and all.

Her father used to take her with him on benders through bars in the city, a practice that drove her mother up a wall, but that she had secretly enjoyed---it certainly beat dull hours doing homework, or trying to keep herself entertained when she had no friends to speak of.

Her mother had hardly been much more sober, and had a habit of drinking heavily on occasion. She didn\'t get violent or angry---instead she got moody, and seemed to be lost in her past. On occasion, she had gathered her daughter to her side and dispensed advice about topics that she was certainly too young to know *that* much detail about.

None of that happened anymore, and it was those things she missed. Not the bars, not the \"advice\", just the people her parents had used to be.

They weren\'t the same people anymore, and she had done it to them. It was that knowledge that ate at her now. How was that much better than the cult leader on X‐25 implanting memories into clones, making them into who they were not?

\"Are you okay, Asami‐chan?\" her mother asked, looking at her with concern. She hadn\'t been eating.

\"Oh I\'m fine,\" she insisted, poking hurriedly at her food. Sometimes she wondered what exactly her parents thought of her, and whether or not it was obvious that she was avoiding them. That was the kind of thing that could be easily written off to her being a teenager, she knew, but she wondered if they suspected at all that there was a deeper reason.

And she couldn\'t speak to them about it. Not now, not ever.

\"Look, it\'s probably necessary that we address the elephant in the room,\" her father said, trying to give her a meaningful gaze. \"I\'m glad everything turned out alright on this X‐25 mission, and our friends are still buzzing about seeing you on the news, but did you really have to go on a mission like this? At the very least, if your girlfriend really wanted to go, you didn\'t have to follow her. It\'d be one thing if they didn\'t give you a choice, but they did. Your mother and I weren\'t happy to hear that, you know.\"

Asami sighed. She had considered taking the easy way. She could have simply told her parents that they had been ordered to go. They wouldn\'t have had anything to say then, and they would have had no way of knowing otherwise. Who would they have asked?

But... she had felt her parents deserved better than that, that they should know the truth, at least this time.

She had known what their reaction would be, and that it would not be much different than how they had responded to the news that she intended to travel to Eurydome with a brand‐new girlfriend and live with her there. Then, their approval had been grudging at best, and only because Asami had couched it as the only way she could get off the front lines.

How, then, to explain her decision to go on the X‐25 mission?

\"We didn\'t feel entirely safe staying on Eurydome after what happened at the lab,\" Asami said, \"and Ryouko was starting to feel a bit claustrophobic staying there. Sakura‐san made a personal request for us to go, and we thought it sounded reasonable.\"

Asami left out any mention of Ryouko\'s aunt, who she had been told in no uncertain terms to pretend didn\'t exist.

\"Reasonable?\" her father asked rhetorically, cutting into a chicken cutlet with his knife. \"Taking on a mission like that? If your girlfriend was bored, she could have gotten a hobby. If she\'s the kind of girl who actually *wants* to be involved in things like that, then I have to say I have serious concerns about this relationship. I can only say it sounds misguided on her part.\"

\"Don\'t be like that, Dad,\" Riki said, surprising Asami by speaking before she could.

His parents looked as surprised as she was. Her younger brother didn\'t ever involve himself in these kinds of conversations, a defensive habit that stemmed from before her contract, when Asami often spoke for both of them to spare him from her parents\' wrath.

\"Not everyone can just \'get a hobby\' to do what they want,\" Riki said. \"I don\'t think there\'s anything wrong with wanting a career in the military. Look at how much Shizuki‐chan has been in the news! Besides, it\'s not like she\'s a regular member of the military. She\'s always doing special forces type stuff.\"

\"Shizuki‐*chan?*\" Asami\'s mom asked, raising an eyebrow.

\"Shizuki‐san. I slipped. Anyway, I know it\'s probably not easy for nee‐chan to be involved in this kind of thing, because she obviously doesn\'t like the violence, but that\'s for the two of them to hash out, right?\"

Asami had her own questions about what her brother had been thinking about Shizuki‐*chan,* but was overall grateful for the interruption, which had evidently derailed the train of parental disapproval. Her parents looked bemused for a moment---though only for a moment.

\"That\'s a huge oversimplification, Riki‐kun,\" her father said, giving her brother a not‐so‐subtle look that signaled he was interrupting in business too important for him. \"This is more serious than just a matter of what they want to do with their lives. Obviously you\'re free to do whatever you want, but this is the one thing that comes with the chance to *die.* It was bad enough that she made the contract, but now she\'s turning down the chance to work a normal job for a chance to go back to fighting. It\'s crazy.\"

Her mother grabbed her father\'s arm, glancing at Asami.

\"Don\'t talk about death,\" she said. \"You\'re upsetting her. You\'re getting carried away.\"

Asami didn\'t know whether to laugh or cry. The sad truth was, she wasn\'t afraid of death *per se,* not anymore. If there was anything that was stabilizing about having strong evidence of the existence of a Goddess of Magical Girls---one she had even talked to!---it was that she no longer had to fear the implications of death without an afterlife.

The only thing she was really worried about right now was losing *her, the centralizing force that had opened her eyes to a broader world and given her a new lease on life after her wish had gone so painfully wrong, after a life that had been miserable. The force the Goddess had verbally instructed her to keep an eye on.

That was why she was visibly upset. Not at the idea of death, or even her father criticizing the risks she was taking. The--the nerve of it, for these *imposters* to criticize her contract, her wish that had brought them into being.

MSY doctrine implied that the soul was inviolate, but then what exactly had she done to her parents? What did it mean to have the same soul, but memories and personality that were so different?

She stood up from the table, not really sure yet what she was going to do.

\"I\'m not hungry right now,\" she said as blandly as she could. \"I\'ll be in my room.\"

*I\'m sorry,* she thought, as she walked away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*...subsystem test complete. Outcome nominal.*

*Stimulus response nominal. Thalamocortical feedback within predicted range. Randomized testing matches previous recordings. All outcomes nominal. Entering standby...*

*Don\'t just leave like that---* Ryouko began, before realizing there was no Goddess to hear her thoughts, not here.

*Easy there,* Clarisse thought, soothing. *They\'re just running some last checks before they wake you. I guess I\'m your company.*

It was Clarisse\'s voice that had been reading the test outcomes into her mind, Ryouko realized, though the voice had transitioned from smooth and mechanical to warm and human.

*I guess you are,* Ryouko thought. She should have been more distressed, waking up to an empty void deprived of sensory input, but the vision with the Goddess had clued her into what was about to happen---and she assumed Clarisse was doing something to keep her calm.

*Wait.*

*You\'re still alive?* Ryouko blurted out crassly. *I thought---if I ever lost my bod---*

*Yes, I\'m surprised too,* Clarisse thought. *I had expected, best case, to be pushing up daisies in whatever afterlife this magical girl goddess has in store. She gave me an answer this time, you know. I* do *have a soul. Strictly speaking, my body was vaporized by the laser, but since your *soul gem was kind enough to consider my body part of* your *body, it went to the trouble to rebuild me. It turns out, when you get revived from a perfect copy like that, your soul transfers. According to her, the soul, being free of linear time, isn\'t troubled by gaps in space‐time like that. It\'s very nice to have a reliable divine source for such troubling philosophical questions. I can think of a couple of starship AIs who might want the reassurance, if they\'ll believe me.*

*I... see,* Ryouko responded, realizing that this was a distinctly odd conversation to be having at a time like this. *But what happens if you duplicate---*

*Yeah, I got shoved back here right when I was about to ask,* Clarisse thought. *I\'ve been kept occupied with making sure things are up‐to‐spec with your brain. They usually run these things through the clone\'s TacComp, you know, though I think they were surprised I got fully restored. Anyway, I hope you don\'t mind that I woke you a bit early to chat. I thought it\'d be best to get this out of the way.*

*You woke me early?* Ryouko thought.

*Yeah,* Clarisse thought. *The doctors seem annoyed at me for it, but I\'m ignoring them. There\'s something else I need to talk to you about, but now really isn\'t the time. They\'ve finally decided to have me bring the rest of you online. Hold on.*

For a moment, nothing seemed any different, but then *sensation* crept back into her awareness: the vague sense of being horizontal, the presence of her muscles and joints, the rhythmic movement of her diaphragm, the thousands of tiny sensations through which the brain kept watch over its domain. She felt the distinct, uncomfortable sensation of objects pressed against her skin, of things that, perhaps, even went under her skin.

Finally, a sense of darkness heralded the return of her vision, and she began to hear the quiet noises of the room around her.

\"I can\'t believe it *came back,*\" someone whispered. \"The Ethics Committee is going to kill us---\"

She snapped her eyes open.

Her mother loomed over her with an expression of studied concern. From the corner of her eye, she could see her father caught between peering at a tablet with one eye and at Ryouko with the other.

And standing next to her mother was, of course, Asami, who she was at the moment quite glad to see. Like her parents, she represented a bedrock of familiarity in what was starting to seem like an increasingly warped world.

Asami was making an odd, scrunched‐up expression, holding her hands up to her face. Ryouko didn\'t understand what it meant until she opened her mouth to say something, and Asami dove forward, startling her.

She held the girl against her as she bawled on her shoulder, reflecting that this, after all, was real. The sensation of skin against skin, of hair twisting with hair, of hormones in the bloodstream. She wasn\'t sure if it were possible to replicate such things in the Goddess\'s afterlife.

*I missed you,* Asami thought.

*It\'s good to be back,* Ryouko thought, smiling.

She looked up, and her mother smiled down at her, then shook her head slightly. Ryouko knew what her mother was thinking.

*First‐timers. Never handle it well. You get used to it.*

She held up her hand and regarded it, drumming her fingers against the air. That was right, wasn\'t it? She should have been bothered by the fact that she was in a new body, that the one she had been born into, the one that she had once inhabited, was gone now.

And yet she wasn\'t. Maybe it was the amount of time she had spent in visions, maybe it was her parents\' background, or maybe it was seeing Asami undergo the same thing, but it just didn\'t seem to bother her.

\"You gave us quite a scare, Ryouko,\" her mother said, leaning over towards the two of them. \"I warned you about taking missions like this. We\'re just glad you made it back with soul gem intact.\"

\"Don\'t give her that kind of talk,\" her father said, striding over and pocketing his tablet in his lab coat. \"She knew what she was doing, and she made it back, didn\'t she?\"

Her father and mother glared daggers at each over the foot of her bed, and Ryouko felt the old discomfort returning. Her life on Earth was now completely gone---if it had ever been there to start with.

*You don\'t know what it was like, without you,* Asami thought. *I don\'t have anything here anymore!*

*I think I might,* Ryouko thought, looking at her parents.

They hugged there for a moment longer, but a sense of uneasiness had intruded into her mind‐state. She couldn\'t shake the feeling that there was something, or *someone* right behind her.

\"I am sorry to intrude,\" Joanne Valentin said, appearing behind her from one of the back corners of the room, \"but there is a bit to discuss regarding the circumstances of Ryouko‐san\'s revival. If I may?\"

She looked at Ryouko\'s parents, who nodded, and Asami stood back up, looking a combination of embarrassed and defiant.

\"Well, as I\'m sure you\'ve noticed, Ryouko‐san\'s revival has been substantially delayed. Part of this was due to her unusual genetics, though we have considerable experience dealing with cases like hers. The primary reason was, however, her upgraded Version Two Tactical Computer, which her soul gem saw fit to restore along with the rest of her nervous system. We have not previously had to restore a Version Two user in this fashion, so this unexpected result necessitated a redesign of the procedure.\"

They nodded, and she continued:

\"I am happy to report, however, that thus far everything seems to have gone smoothly. With any luck, we will be able to clear her after only a few more days of monitoring.\"

There was a moment of silence while they waited to see if Joanne would continue.

\"Well, this whole thing only makes the situation with the Version Twos even more complicated,\" her father said, glancing at Ryouko. \"It is very lucky that she was moved to Earth, then, since we *designed* the Version Two, after all. Was it anticipated that something unusual might happen?\"

\"As you said, we designed it,\" Joanne said, giving her father an inscrutable look. \"We\'ve been on the look‐out for a Version Two bodyloss for a while, because we needed the data. I think the results here soundly affirm the value of said data. There was of course some risk associated with the interstellar transport, but there would have also been some risk allowing another facility to handle the procedure. Especially given her unusual genetic background.\"

\"The Version Twos continue to be quite a puzzle, for sure,\" her father said.

*I wonder if they\'ve considered just asking one of us,* Clarisse thought dryly.

*That\'s not how this kind of thing works,* Ryouko responded.

\"Anyway, I wanted to personally convey my apologies for the delay,\" Joanne said, \"and my thankfulness for your cooperation. On a separate, personal note, I\'d like to say that I heard about the unfortunate incident on Eurydome. A real shame. I thought their experimental facilities were better designed than that, but I suppose they\'re no Adept Blue. We\'re going to have to look into other placement opportunities, since I doubt you have any urge to move to an asteroid.\"

Joanne\'s oddly unsettling eyes peered at Ryouko. There was something about them that reminded her of... well, something. She wasn\'t sure what.

*So she doesn\'t know what really happened at the facility,* Ryouko thought.

*I wouldn\'t say that,* Clarisse said. *I get the feeling she knows a lot more than she lets on. And I can\'t tell what\'s familiar about her either---the memory trace is too vague.*

\"Ah, yeah, probably not Adept Blue,\" Ryouko said, finally remembering that she was supposed to say something. \"I\'m, uh, grateful for your hard work.\"

It had finally begun to dawn on her just how close she had been to losing Clarisse, in a metaphorical sense at least. She had gotten used to the comforting internal voice, and would have felt empty without it. It was odd, given that she had spent most of her life alone in her own head.

Joanne Valentin smiled and nodded.

\"Alright, well, I\'ll stop intruding, but it\'s about time the technicians removed the tubing. Nakihara‐san, I wouldn\'t recommend you stick around for this.\"

Asami swallowed and shook her head.

\"It\'s alright. I was here myself before, so...\"

Joanne nodded, then turned and left the room, privacy door sliding shut behind her.

Ryouko had, of course, finally remembered to look under the sheets that covered her. She had forgotten entirely about the vague objects she felt on her, and what she saw... was morbidly fascinating, and more than a little disturbing.

Wiring that ran to all her accessible dataports, electrodes in strategic locations, and tubing that ran *into* parts of her flesh. She wouldn\'t have credited it was there---somehow, she barely felt them.

She hadn\'t watched all of Asami\'s procedure, so it was all very new to her.

\"Don\'t worry,\" her mother said. \"It looks scary, but pulling them out is quite painless.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A short while later they headed out into the waiting room, where Ryouko was stunned to find a surprising number of her friends gathered, including Meiqing, her old friends Chiaki and Ruiko, and none other than Sacnite, who ran forward to pull Ryouko into an unexpected hug. Ryouko indulged the girl for a moment, but kept her eyes open, querying her nomenclator on the identities of two new girls standing next to the group, openly glowering at each other.

Just as the nomenclator returned a result, one of the girls stepped forward.

\"Greetings, Shizuki Ryouko‐san,\" the girl said, bowing formally and allowing her short hair to fall over her eyes. \"I am Kuroi Eri, part of the security detail that has been assigned to you. My presence was requested by our matriarch and it is an honor---\"

\"Don\'t give her that bullshit!\" the other girl---Shizuki Elanis---said, stepping in front of Eri and sticking a finger in her face. \"We had a deal! This is *our* security detail, and you should introduce us *properly.*\"

Eri glanced at the other girl, let out a breath, then continued:

\"Alright, part of the *joint* security detail that has been assigned to you. Our presence here was requested by both of our matriarchs, and it is an honor to finally meet you. While Elanis and I are relatively young, we are backed by established, though non‐magical, security professionals, and we *have* had combat training. I hope you\'ll understand that the war effort cannot spare true veterans.\"

Eri bowed formally again and Elanis followed suit a moment later. This was followed by sharp glaring, clearly accompanied by an angry telepathic conversation.

\"Security detail?\" Ryouko asked openly, letting go of Sacnite, who peered back at her with wide, wondrous eyes. It was odd to be so treated by a girl Ryouko could hardly even say she knew.

*Courtesy of your matriarchs,* Meiqing thought quietly, sidling up to them. *They absolutely* insisted, *after all that has happened to you, especially whatever it is that happened in the lab you were staying in. Can\'t lose a valuable asset, after all. Personally, I\'m not sure how much they help.*

*There\'s more than two, though?* Ryouko asked.

*Oh yes, though you probably don\'t have to meet more than the two leaders. They\'re all lurking around somewhere, monitoring the perimeter or something like that. They don\'t like each other, but neither of them will back down, so we\'re stuck with both of them.*

Ryouko made a face.

\"Alright, I understand,\" she said to Eri and Elanis, who were still clearly busy having an argument over their respective turfs. \"Thank you for your support, I\'m sure I will feel much safer with you around. Will you two be, uh, staying around?\"

\"Oh no, Shizuki‐san,\" Eri said, shaking her head. \"We\'ll stay invisible, don\'t you worry. Isn\'t that right, Elanis‐chan?\"

\"I told you not to call me that!\" Elanis said.

\"Well I can\'t call you Shizuki‐san, since that would be confusing.\"

\"You\'re just jealous she\'s not called Kuroi. Ugh, let\'s just go. We\'re embarrassing ourselves.\"

The two bodyguards filed out of the room, leaving an awkward silence in their wake.

\"Ah, Ryouko, it\'s so nice to finally see you again. I was terrified after I heard what happened.\"

That voice, in shy Standard, came from Sacnite, though it took Ryouko a moment to recognize it. It was the same voice, but something about it sounded so... different.

\"It\'s good to see you too,\" Ryouko said, bending over slightly to peer at the other girl. \"How has it been?\"

Privately, Ryouko wondered what Sacnite was even doing here. It also seemed to her that the girl was smaller than she had been before.

The girl moved her foot in small circles, looking down shyly.

\"Well, the doctors said it\'d be good for me to spend time with some of you, since I don\'t really know anyone else...\"

Ryouko\'s mother tapped her on the shoulder, pulling her aside a moment later.

\"The memory deterioration is getting worse,\" she whispered. \"The MHD recommended slowly lowering her physical age back into something that more accurately matches her personality. She\'s in my care, for now. Just bear with it.\"

Ryouko looked back at the child, who was now clinging to Asami\'s arm. She wasn\'t sure how to feel about any of it, other than an empty sadness for Sacnite.

\"Hey, it will be alright,\" she said awkwardly, patting the other girl on the head. \"Look, I\'m fine now.\"

\"Yeah,\" Sacnite said, sniffing.

The door to the room slid open a moment.

\"Absolute jokers!\" Kyouko said, stomping into the room on a wave of anger. \"As if I need to be screened!\"

Kyouko didn\'t bother to explain her comment, brushing off her sleeve in dismissive anger. It was a loud, attention‐grabbing entrance, and Ryouko wasn\'t sure that was unintentional.

Kyouko cleared her throat a moment later, then looked at Ryouko.

\"I heard you were back alive,\" she said, peering at Ryouko out of the corner of her eye. \"I hate to interrupt, but do you mind if we had a little chat in private? There\'s something we need to talk about.\"

It was an unusual request, and Ryouko looked around at her friends before responding. They seemed as nonplussed as she was, but her mother shrugged and nudged her forward.

\"We\'ll be fine,\" she said. \"Go ahead. I\'m sure you two have much to talk about.\"

As she walked toward Kyouko, she quickly reviewed the reasons why Kyouko might want to talk to her. It didn\'t seem---

*Oh right,* she realized, doing the mental equivalent of slapping herself on the forehead. She had sacrificed her body to save Kyouko, and it hadn\'t occurred to her yet that it might be considered a big deal, or even that Kyouko might have died despite it. For her, it had only been the span of one vision, but for the others it had been...

*About ten days,* Clarisse thought, before Ryouko had time to consult her chronometer. She hadn\'t even thought to check which day it was.

Kyouko nodded as Ryouko reached the door, shepherding her out into the long hallway that connected the waiting rooms of Prometheus with the world outside, carefully isolated from the rest of the building. At the moment the area was deserted.

\"First off, I want to thank you for saving my life,\" Kyouko said, the exact moment the doors closed behind them. \"It\'s been a long time since I\'ve been in any really dangerous situation, and I guess I\'ve lost my touch. I\'m sorry for losing my head.\"

\"That\'s alright,\" Ryouko said. \"It has to happen to everyone at some point, right?\"

She said the words without thinking, out of social instinct, and immediately regretted them. Was that really the right thing to say to an Ancient?

Kyouko gave Ryouko an odd look, but shook her head and said:

\"Well, I just thought I should say something like that in person. I owe you, okay?\"

To Ryouko\'s surprise, Kyouko stuck out a hand, smiling mischievously. It took Ryouko a moment to realize she was supposed to shake it, which she did. Kyouko\'s grip was painful.

Finally, Kyouko released her hand, grinning, before abruptly losing her smile a moment later.

*Anyway, I had something else I wanted to talk about too. I heard your revival was a bit delayed. Did they tell you why?*

*Yeah, it\'s because of my Version Two TacComp,* Ryouko thought, surprised by the sudden switch to private telepathy. *Apparently my soul gem revived it, which they didn\'t expect, so they had to modify the procedure.*

*Anything else?* Kyouko asked.

Ryouko turned her head slightly, wondering at the point of this line of questioning.

*Not really,* she said. *That was the main reason they gave.*

*Well, that\'s interesting,* Kyouko thought.

Before they could continue, the sound of footsteps behind Kyouko drew their attention.

Ryouko surprised herself by successfully containing her shock at the new arrival. It was the last person she would have expected to see here, or anywhere, someone who by reputation was almost never seen in person anymore.

*But am I really surprised?* she thought, reflecting on the contents of the vision she had just had.

\"Well this is a surprise,\" Kyouko said, eyeing Chitose Yuma as she approached, flanked on one side by a spherical flying drone whose purpose Ryouko couldn\'t discern.

\"I thought I\'d come pay a visit to the girl who saved your life,\" Yuma said, casting a glance between the two of them. \"There aren\'t many opportunities nowadays for anyone to claim the distinction of saving one of us. Of course, it helped that I knew you\'d probably be here too. Do you two have the time to talk elsewhere? It\'s claustrophobic standing here talking in this hall.\"

Ryouko glanced at the sliding door behind which her family was still waiting.

\"Only if it doesn\'t take too long,\" Kyouko said, gesturing with her head towards the same door. \"Maybe send your family a message, Ryouko.\"

Yuma nodded, catching the meaning even as Ryouko followed through with Kyouko\'s suggestion.

\"There\'s a botanical garden just down this hall,\" she said. \"It\'s a place for outgoing patients to visit and relax, so it suits our exact purposes.\"

They followed Yuma down the hall, Ryouko wondering whether Yuma had been here before. Probably, she decided.

The botanical garden turned out to be indoors, though pure sunlight that seemed to filter down through the canopy left her blinking in confusion at first. She knew very well that it was impossible to get this much sunlight in Mitakihara without ascending to the top of one of the tallest buildings.

\"It\'s an illusion,\" a holographic attendant standing by the doorway explained. \"The ceiling is designed to resemble the natural sky.\"

\"Ah,\" Ryouko responded.

Yuma led them to a clearing set near one of the sidewalls of the facility, where giant glass windows gazed upon a sunny view of Mitakihara from the sea---clearly another illusion.

Ryouko took a moment to pause and peer at the leaves of a nearby tall bush, pulling one of the branches over for closer inspection. The dark green tissue of the leaf was shot through with light green leaf veins and... tendrils of blue? Was this an alien plant?

\"This facility is part of a project working on the computational modification of plant life,\" Yuma said, by way of explanation. "Sensors, transceivers, and computing modules that grow along with the plants themselves. There\'s a lot of potential for enhancing our terraforming capability, both for new colonies and the lost regions of Earth. Governance is particularly interested in the possibility of embedding computing capability into the ecosystem itself, so that vast computing power could be deployed without unduly disturbing the appearance of the existing biosphere. It\'s one of my favorite projects.\"

Indeed, Yuma had the look of a girl describing a pet project, and Ryouko caught Kyouko giving Yuma an odd look.

\"That sounds a little disturbing, to be honest,\" Kyouko said.

\"You say that about *everything,*\" Yuma said, rolling her eyes.

\"That\'s because everything you do is disturbing,\" Kyouko retorted.

Ryouko watched Yuma for a long moment, the girl framed by the illusory sunlight and cityscape of the window behind her. She seemed so different from what she might have imagined---not the bright, happy heart of the Mitakihara Four the media portrayed, nor the dark phantom in so many of the stories, nor even the suave diplomat she had met at the birthday party.

This one seemed more real, more like the Yuma she had seen sitting with Mami and... MG? in her scarcely‐processed vision.

Yuma made no move to start the discussion, merely looking at the two of them expectantly.

\"Any progress on knowing who exactly I was being saved from, then?\" Kyouko asked. \"Since you made such a point of coming here to see the girl who did it.\"

\"Well, it\'s not the first time I\'ve met her,\" Yuma demurred, ducking her head slightly. \"But the last time was hardly a conversation.\"

She shook her head.

\"Anyway, I won\'t say there was no progress, but... there hasn\'t been enough progress to report is I suppose the way to put it. But we\'d be getting ahead of ourselves to talk about that here. How are you doing, Ryouko‐chan? The new body treating you well?\"

Yuma stuck out a hand for Ryouko to shake, but for a moment all Ryouko could see was the Yuma seen in flashback in her vision: young, vulnerable, and incredibly dangerous.

The image passed in a moment, leaving her in shock at the difference four centuries could make---though she had a feeling \"incredibly dangerous\" was still an accurate descriptor.

Ryouko took her hand and completed the handshake, a moment too late. She hoped Yuma interpreted her hesitation as surprise that Yuma hadn\'t exchanged bows instead.

\"I\'m doing, uh, fine,\" Ryouko said a moment later. \"I mean, I just got put back together, so you know, one moment I\'m diving in front of Kyouko, the next I\'m here.\"

She realized, too late, that she had lied out of nervousness, but what else was she supposed to say?

\"Yes, I understand,\" Yuma said. \"You know, they say us Ancients have a lot of experience, but most of us are still wearing the same ancient bodies. Ship of Theseus aside, you younger girls have experienced something none of us ever have. It\'s worth respecting.\"

\"I suppose,\" Ryouko said, surprised by the politeness of Yuma\'s comment and, of course, unsure what to say. She didn\'t think she had time to look up what Yuma meant by \"Ship of Theseus\".

\"Did they mention anything unusual about the revival process?\" Yuma asked. \"I heard there was a delay.\"

It was the second time the question had come up, enough that Ryouko felt a tiny twinge of suspicion, but Yuma\'s face seemed open and honest, almost a mirror of Sacnite\'s, and Ryouko couldn\'t help but be moved.

\"There was a slight delay because of my Version Two TacComp,\" Ryouko said, unsure how much detail to give, \"but other than that, nothing.\"

\"Good,\" Yuma said.

She turned towards Kyouko, and for the first time Ryouko became conscious of an apparent tension between the two Ancients, conveyed most clearly in Kyouko\'s body language. The tension had lingered in the back of her mind and had colored Yuma\'s entrance, increasing Ryouko\'s wariness in turn, but only now was she fully aware of it.

\"You see,\" Yuma said. \"Your old hang‐ups almost got a wonderful girl like her killed. What do you have to say for yourself?\"

Yuma\'s tone was jokingly accusing, but something in her demeanor suggested that it wasn\'t really a joke.

\"Don\'t try to guilt me,\" Kyouko said, giving the other girl an odd look. \"Not here, not now. It\'s only a fluke, and you know it.\"

\"It\'s a fluke that could happen because *you* won\'t deal with it,\" Yuma said, leaning forward. \"In the long run, this kind of thing will keep happening, even if it\'s only once in a long while, and eventually it\'s going to get you. You can\'t have these flaws! You just can\'t!\"

\"Who cares, Yuma? No one is going to live forever, and I don\'t care if I can\'t! I don\'t care about long‐term stability! I\'ll live until I die, and then that\'s it. Then I can see the Goddess, and I can move on.\"

Yuma openly staggered at the comment, looking shocked for the first time in Ryouko\'s brief experience. It occurred to Ryouko that this conversation had all the flavor of an unfinished argument renewed, and that Yuma had probably used her as a tool to corner Kyouko into a discussion she didn\'t want to have.

She knew she should have felt bothered, but the apparent earnestness of Yuma\'s dialogue roused her sympathy.

\"Don\'t you say that!\" Yuma said, child\'s face marred by sudden anger. \"Don\'t you ever say that! I haven\'t spent all these years keeping you alive so you can waste it all on a death wish!\"

Yuma\'s face blanched, instantly regretting her outburst. It seemed out of character for her.

*Maybe she just finished telling MG about her past,* Clarisse thought. I wouldn\'t blame her for being shaken after that.*

*You saw that vision?* Ryouko thought, surprised even though she shouldn\'t have been. She simply hadn\'t had any time to think about anything, and here she was facing down both Yuma and Kyouko.

*Yes,* Clarisse thought, *or at least that part of it.*

Clarisse had done Ryouko the favor of accelerating their internal conversation, allowing Ryouko enough time to watch Kyouko react, face starting to twist in anger, before visibly restraining herself.

\"I don\'t have a death wish,\" Kyouko said, voice quiet. \"I\'m just being realistic. You can\'t control everything, Yuma‐chan. That\'s your problem, isn\'t it? Trying to keep your hand in everything.\"

Kyouko looked down for a moment. Kyouko sounded very different from her normal self. Older, more thoughtful, perhaps.

\"That\'s why you\'re here, to try to use Ryouko here to change my behavior,\" Kyouko continued. \"But I don\'t aspire to keep all the variables under control. I prefer to let the Goddess handle that kind of thing.\"

Yuma closed her eyes for a moment at the response, leaving Ryouko to shift uncomfortably. Should she try to leave?

Before Ryouko could make that decision, Yuma opened her eyes again to respond.

\"Where was your Goddess all those years ago, though, nee‐chan?\" she said. \"Where was she for me, or Oriko‐nee‐chan, or Miki‐san?\"

Kyouko\'s eyebrow twitched, even as Ryouko struggled to remember who "Miki‐san\" was.

*She was in the vision,* Clarisse thought. *It\'s not showing up in your NeverForget module, but she was the girl who used to be part of the Mitakihara team, the one Yuma had ramen with.*

Kyouko paused for a moment, effort poured into taking a deep breath.

\"You\'re doing it again,\" she said, peering at Yuma. \"You\'re trying to make me angry, so you can make the point you want to make. What do you want me to say? I\'ve had a long time to think about it. I am sure the Goddess has her reasons, so yes, Sayaka\'s death served a purpose, and sure, I should move on. That\'s what you\'re going to say.\"

Yuma peered back and nodded, slowly and purposefully.

\"I\'m glad I don\'t even have to say it out loud. So why aren\'t you doing* it?\"

\"Because no one can do it on command, Yuma! That\'s not how it works! You think I haven\'t tried?\" Kyouko demanded, now leaning forward to mirror Yuma. \"It\'s like the MHD says. We all have our little eccentricities. This is mine.\"

Kyouko let out a breath.

\"And I\'ve had a lot of time to think back and sort my memories, especially now that I\'ve got these boxes in my head to arrange things. The demons that attacked us the day that she died---Mami always said that they were so strong it didn\'t make sense, and Kyubey even mentioned the cubes being unusual. There was only one person at the time who might have had that kind of specialty. You think I want to hear you* tell me to let her go? No. Not from you.\"

Yuma\'s carefully serious face fractured again, leaving her gaping, just a little.

\"God, Kyouko, it wasn\'t---\"

\"It was Oriko, right?\" Kyouko said, turning away from the others. "Yeah, sure, I can see that. I know it\'s what makes sense. I just...\"

She stood there, facing the wall for a long moment.

\"Just leave me alone, alright?\" she said. \"I don\'t want to talk about it.\"

Yuma stared at Kyouko for a long moment, then nodded.

\"Alright,\" she said. \"I\'m sorry. There\'s nothing else I can say.\"

Yuma turned on her heel and left, moving with startling speed back into the hallway, drone following her closely. The sunlight on Yuma\'s back cast her face into relative darkness, which seemed all too appropriate at the moment.

Ryouko turned to leave as well, heading out of the exotic garden, but Kyouko held up a hand, startling her into stopping abruptly. Ryouko had gotten used to being the invisible party in this conversation.

\"I\'m sorry about that,\" Kyouko said, standing up a bit straighter. "Just a little old drama.\"

Ryouko cast her eyes to the ground. Once again, she had the sense she was supposed to go against her natural inclination, that she needed to say* something, or else what was even the point of the vision she had received? The close connection of events couldn\'t possibly be a coincidence.

But did she really want to let Kyouko know what had happened?

\"It really wasn\'t her fault, you know,\" Ryouko settled on saying.

\"What?\" Kyouko asked, tilting her head. \"What are you talking about?\"

\"Miki‐san,\" Ryouko said. \"That wasn\'t her fault. Yuma even met her beforehand. Oriko didn\'t tell her what she was doing, but she still felt bad about it.\"

\"What are you---\" Kyouko began, before pausing and giving Ryouko a careful look.

\"How do you know this?\" she said finally.

\"I don\'t know,\" Ryouko said, shaking her head, answering the wrong question--- \"why\", instead of \"how\". \"It was a vision, showing me the past, but I don\'t really know what to do with it.\"

She avoided looking at Kyouko while talking, but from the corner of her eye she saw the girl taking a breath to gather herself.

\"You saw Sayaka?\" she asked.

Ryouko nodded, still avoiding the other girl\'s gaze.

\"Only in flashback, though. Only as a memory of what happened.\"

\"No one has ever seen Sayaka in a vision,\" Kyouko said. \"Not even me, and believe me: I\'ve tried. I know you can\'t control what the Goddess decides to show you, but I\'ve only had a few visions, none related. Everyone else is getting to meet family members and friends, but for me, nothing. I\'m starting to think Sayaka doesn\'t want to talk to me. I wouldn\'t blame her.\"

Ryouko finally looked up, finding Kyouko looking emptily at her hands. She was beginning to understand how exactly the Ancient had lost her cool on X‐25, and why Yuma had called it a weakness, as unfair as that seemed.

\"She was obviously important to you,\" Ryouko said, \"but I doubt that\'s the case. I haven\'t ever had the dead speak to me. Maybe it just doesn\'t happen much.\"

\"Your vision,\" Kyouko said, turning her eye towards Ryouko. \"How much of it involved Sayaka? Did you see anything other than how she died?\"

\"I didn\'t even see it. It was only a side detail. It was mostly about Yuma, actually.\"

Kyouko closed her eyes.

\"A pity. I can\'t call the Theological Council for this one.\"

Ryouko blinked in surprise. She had honestly forgotten all about the council.

\"I just wish I knew what the point of it was,\" Kyouko said, a moment later, shifting her gaze towards one of the trees, which seemed to be actively moving a branch towards the light. \"I\'ve convinced myself that everything serves a purpose, but why did she have to die? Why couldn\'t* she be saved? Would she have gotten in the way?\"

Ryouko waited long seconds for Kyouko to continue, but she stayed silent.

\"I don\'t know,\" Ryouko said finally.

\"Yeah, you can\'t say anything more than that,\" Kyouko said, straightening her back. \"None of us can, not in this world.\"

Kyouko looked down at the floor, and Ryouko followed her gaze. The paved stone paths reminded her of the stone flooring of Kyouko\'s church.

\"I wouldn\'t talk to Yuma about this,\" Kyouko said. \"First of all, it\'s just not a good idea, and secondly, I suspect the topic will come up on its own somehow, eventually. That seems to be how it works.\"

\"I got the feeling I was supposed to say something to you now,\" Ryouko said, \"but I don\'t know that this has gone anywhere.\"

\"Maybe it\'s a hint for me to try and visit the Ribbon again,\" Kyouko said. \"I\'ve thought about it after that mission and, well, this all seems rather coincidental to me.\"

Ryouko examined Kyouko\'s expression, thinking back to what she had managed to piece together about Kyouko\'s involvement with Kishida Maki. She didn\'t know much, only that they had been in a relationship, that it had fallen through, and that Maki had ended up nearly dead on the planet Apollo, reduced to just her soul gem, just as Ryouko had been.

There was more to it than that, obviously. It was apparent from Kyouko\'s behavior, and even Yuma\'s, how important Miki Sayaka had been to her, and now that she had seen Sayaka in the vision, however indirectly, it was impossible to ignore the startling resemblance between the two girls.

*It can\'t be healthy,* Clarisse thought. *The massive age gap aside, the warning flags here are tremendous. I can\'t imagine that Yuma, Mami, or the MHD would have missed something so obvious.*

*Yes, but they broke up,* Ryouko thought. *It\'s over now.*

*Yes, and how do you think Maki feels about that?*

Ryouko looked again at Kyouko, who was at this point as lost in thought as Ryouko was, and thought about Asami.

*I can\'t imagine her doing that without knowing Maki would be okay with it,* Ryouko thought. *She was the one who said the first one is special. She seems like a romantic.*

*Really? Would someone thinking like that really have a relationship like this in the first place? Would Yuma and the others allow her to? They must know something we don\'t.*

Ryouko shook her head, not because she disagreed with Clarisse\'s statement, but because of her unease with the situation. She had no solid reason for thinking so, but she had the impression of blundering about in a dark room.

\"The first one is special, right?\" Ryouko said, deciding the safest route was to simply acknowledge what was going unsaid. \"That was Miki‐san?\"

Kyouko peered into Ryouko\'s eyes searchingly, not the aggressive soul‐searing gaze of an Ancient who wished to know everything, but simply the gaze of a girl who wanted to know what was going on.

\"Yes,\" Kyouko said, exhaling, looking almost embarrassed. \"And, you know, I\'m really obvious about it, right? Well, you can\'t really control your hang‐ups.\"

\"How is Kishida Maki doing?\" Ryouko asked, unable to think of another way to ask, but unable to let go of the concern. \"I know you---\"

Ryouko jolted at a smashing sound, startled by Kyouko\'s fist slamming against the trunk of a nearby tree---though the fact that the tree remained intact suggested a certain residual restraint, even if pieces of bark had fallen off, revealing what looked suggestively like circuitry underneath.

Kyouko leveled at finger at Ryouko, face twisting in and out of an angry snarl, but, despite a series of attempts, seemed unable to form any words, lips shifting back and forth between various false starts.

\"Goddamn it,\" she said finally, turning brusquely away from Ryouko. "Now I\'ve got neophytes like you giving me shit. I\'d say it\'s none of your business, but the problem is you\'re right. You\'re right.\"

Ryouko saw Kyouko cross her arms, as if she were giving herself a hug. It was difficult to tell, looking at the girl\'s back.

Then Kyouko shook her head, just as Ryouko had earlier.

\"I\'m going to go,\" Kyouko said. \"I\'ve got things to do, think about. Your family is probably wondering what the hell we\'re doing out here. I\'m wasting your time and embarrassing myself. See you.\"

Without even a glance back, Kyouko strode away, following the same route Yuma had, raising one hand in a backwards wave goodbye.

\"Ah, goodbye,\" Ryouko said.

She wondered if the other girl even heard her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometime in the early 2060s---several lifetimes ago---Mami had heard that their old middle school, by then an aging, out‐of‐date facility, was going to be the victim of yet another round of local government budget cuts. It was a reasonable decision---at the time there were increasingly fewer children to actually *use* the school facilities---but Mami was as ever the victim of nostalgia and wanted desperately to save it.

In the end, Homura proposed that the MSY offer to take over the institution, in exchange for paying for renovations and running it as a tuition‐free private school. It was not merely an exercise in nostalgia and charity---there was a strong argument for the MSY taking over the management of a good number of local schools, to better accommodate the needs of newly contracted magical girls. As for the lack of students, they could extend instruction through high scool. Their old school seemed as good a potential pilot school as any other, and the proposal was approved.

It was Kyouko who eventually suggested that they convert part of the campus into an open air park, and rename the whole institution Miki Sayaka Secondary School, secretly dedicated to those magical girls who died too young. *That* had been an unabashed exercise in sentimentalism.

Nowadays, there were very few ground‐level spaces left in Mitakihara City which still had a clear view of the sky, and Kyouko rarely visited any of them, but she always had a particular affection for the park that adjoined the school. It... helped her to think about the past, and put everything that happened into a bit of a longer perspective. Despite the jokes Mami and Yuma often leveled at her, Kyouko knew she was entirely capable of thinking about the long‐term.

The school buildings shimmered in the distance, sunlight gleaming off the window‐filled architecture that still characterized the institute. Crowds of uniformed students milled about, either openly staring at her or ignoring her entirely, depending on how well‐connected they were in the MSY. By dint of its location and the connections of its early students, the pilot school for the MSY had gradually grown into the MSY\'s largest, most prestigious institution, vertically integrated from the lowest primary school levels all the way up to university‐level training facilities. Kyouko wasn\'t proud---the elitism and nepotism of the Matriarchies were, in her opinion, a disease that threatened the egalitarian ideals they had founded the MSY on.

Kyouko stuck her hands into the pockets of her hoodie and ducked her head, stomping forward while sucking on the stick of candy she held in her mouth. It was one of those fancy futuristic candies that had been a fad a few decades ago, changing flavor regularly to prevent the user\'s taste buds from habituating to the experience. They were passé now, but Kyouko liked them.

She let out a sigh. \"Sentimentalism\", \"vertical integration\", "nepotism\", \"egalitarian\", \"habituating\"---she only had to listen to her own thoughts to realize that she was a vastly different girl than she had once been. As much as she resisted the dead long‐term stasis that the MHD pushed on its older Ancients, she just couldn\'t avoid picking up a certain level of maturity simply by continuing to live.

She stopped in front of the tiny dedication plaque that was hidden in a quiet corner of the park, uncomfortably aware that her style of dress and very face made her stick out like a sore thumb.

A moment later she knelt, brushing the faded lettering carved into the centuries‐old stone slab embedded into the pavement. The many years had done far more damage to the stone than they had done to Kyouko, a role reversal that to her still felt subtly wrong.

> Miki Sayaka Park
>
> Let it never be forgotten that we stand on the deeds of the dead, the forgotten, the never‐remembered.

Homura had insisted on the exact wording of the plaque, for reasons Kyouko had never quite grasped at the time. She understood now, though.

Why was she here, anyway? She didn\'t belong here, not among the young, the fresh‐faced, those without centuries of history weighing down on their shoulders. She lived in constant fear of falling into an endless rut, and clung to the Goddess in the hope that She would know the secret to the conundrum of eternity, the secret of how to balance stability and self‐renewal. It was true, what she had implied to Yuma---that she suspected there was no answer. In that case, it was better to die while living life to the fullest, than to live forever while not really living at all.

She pulled her hood over head, well aware how ridiculous she looked having to try to fit her massive hair under the hood. Like many Ancients, she had never consented to having her hair modified into those little tentacles everyone had nowadays. It wasn\'t that they creeped her out---but doing her hair, running her brush through the luxurious strands, washing them and cleaning them and arranging them... it was undoubtedly therapeutic, and even recommended by the MHD. Plus, when it was always possible to just cheat with magic when you were in a hurry, it seemed lazy to demand your hair to do all the work for you, no matter how oddly sensual the idea seemed sometimes.

It couldn\'t be a coincidence that the only artifacts they had of the Goddess were hair ribbons, right?

Why was she here?

She stood back up a moment later, turning decisively away from the plaque. She knew why she was here---she was afraid of the answers she might find if she went where she really needed to go. She was just buying time, but another one of the downsides of being old was that she understood herself too well not to know that.

There was nothing the stone plaque could say to her, nothing the students gawking at her or even the sky above could tell her. She knew where the real answers might be.

She just hoped someone would talk to her, this time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite what might be expected it was unusual for Kyouko, head sister of the Cult of Hope, to visit the Ribbon of the Goddess. Officially it was to avoid the perception that she was exploiting her position to commune more frequently with the Goddess.

Unofficially, of course, that explanation made no sense.

She waited in line like all the others, though, even though she knew her schedule was full and she couldn\'t really afford the time. She greeted the other girls in line with well‐practiced poise, even stopping to coo at a baby or two. It was second nature to her at this point, something that didn\'t even require her to pay attention, not really.

Still, it was difficult to mask her impatience with the long line. She understood how little sense it made, to have avoided coming here for so long, only to become too impatient to wait when the time finally came.

Like it or not, the moment came soon enough, and she managed to conceal her slight hesitation as she transformed and knelt on the warm red carpeting.

For a long moment she felt the eyes of the room on her, and thought nothing would happen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was the crashing of waves that first made her realize things had changed.

Her eyes snapped open, her ears filling with the distant roar of the ocean and the cacophony of seagulls.

She was still inside the church, as it turned out---but not the building she had built, painstakingly reconstructed by hand by the magical girls of her flock. No---the sunlight that shone through the broken stone walls and shattered stained glass made that clear. It was the church as it had once been---ruined, gutted by flame, abandoned to the elements by a godless world.

But... here? What was it all doing next to the ocean? Her family\'s church had been nowhere near the shoreline.

\"Hello?\" she asked, rising to her feet cautiously.

She could feel the brisk breeze caressing her skin, and smell the salt water that it carried, and hear the whistling noise it made over the ruins of the building---but there was no one around to greet her.

She let out a breath, looking down at her hands. This vision was, so far, qualitatively different from any of her others. Those had been vague, dreamlike affairs. This...

Well, this was reality, with the same fundamental, instinctual certainty that she felt whenever she woke up from a long dream. Her thoughts were clear and her eyes open. The only thing missing was the quiet drumbeat of electronics in the back of her mind, that uniquely modern sensation she had gradually learned to get used to.

But how could that be?

*Listen to me doubt what* She *can do,* Kyouko thought. *I\'m a terrible preacher.*

But still, there was no denying that there was no one there to talk to.

She stepped past the charred ruins of the church\'s pews, heading for the double doors that had once served as the main entrance of the church and which still stood defiantly against the ravages of time. She could have easily stepped straight out through what had once been a wall, but she preferred not to.

As she crossed the threshold, though, she felt her foot hit something soft.

Looking down she felt a wave of... nausea? Distress? Fear? She didn\'t quite know.

She swallowed her feelings anyway, bending down to pick up the stuffed rabbit. It had been Sakura Momo\'s favorite toy, one she had carried around so much that it had gotten worn and dirty, one that Kyouko had gotten tired of having to play with.

The last time she had seen it was as a partially scorched husk, buried in the soil next to what she and Mami had agreed could have been the remains of her sister\'s body. They didn\'t really know, and the police had cared so little that the corpses had been left to smolder where they fell. Maybe if they had cared a bit more someone would have realized Kyouko was still alive.

And here it was again, torn and stained, covered with patches sewn on by their mother, but unburnt.

\"What the fuck is this?\" she said quietly, uncaring that the unseen Goddess would hear her. \"Why remind me of this? It\'s better off buried.\"

\"Bury me, then, *nee‐chan.*\"

Kyouko jerked backward, so surprised that she actually started trying to transform, only to realize that she couldn\'t.

She had never heard the voice before, but it was painfully familiar, and it took surprisingly little time for her to piece it together with the "*nee‐chan*\" greeting and the teenager standing before her.

\"Momo,\" she said wondrously, the name dropping off her lips almost involuntarily.

Looking at the girl was like looking through a funhouse mirror---at a reflection of herself that seemed to shift and distort. Her eyes seemed almost unwilling to focus on an apparition that looked so much like Kyouko herself, and yet was clearly not.

The girl was dressed in a plain white sundress and looked back at her with wide, innocent eyes, older than Kyouko had ever seen her.

\"Is it really you?\" Kyouko asked finally, even as her heart told her the answer.

\"Yes,\" the girl said, reaching out a hand.

Kyouko ran forward and grabbed it, for a moment too overwhelmed to do anything but stare at it, marveling at the fine lines on the palm as she felt her soul weep. She had thought herself long past the point where anything could affect her this deeply.

\"How?\" she asked, looking up at the girl\'s smiling face, framed beautifully by the ocean and horizon behind her.

\"Well, that\'s a silly question, *nee‐chan,*\" she said, teasing. "You\'re having a supernaturally‐powered vision, and you\'re questioning how you can meet the dead. I know you\'re smarter than that.\"

Kyouko shook her head to clear it, blinking away the tears that had started pouring from her eyes.

\"Not that,\" she said. \"You\'re... old.\"

Momo laughed, clear as a bell.

\"You think age matters here?\" she said. \"You have always wondered what I would have been like, had I gotten a chance to grow up a little. Well, here I am.\"

Kyouko let go of her sister\'s hand, getting a bit of a hold on herself. She just had to think carefully of Momo as just another girl. Not the sibling she had cuddled and sheltered on those cold nights when her parents couldn\'t afford to turn on the heat. Just another girl.

\"But why are you here?\" Kyouko asked desperately. \"Why now? Why did you wait all these years?\"

Momo dropped her hand, meeting Kyouko\'s gaze for a moment before glancing away abruptly. To Kyouko, it almost seemed as if she had avoided looking Kyouko in the eye, though she couldn\'t imagine why.

\"To me, it\'s only been a moment,\" Momo said. \"A moment, and also an eternity. You think I had any choice in this? We\'re lucky we get to talk to each other at all. Like this, anyway.\"

Her sister turned away from her, to cast her eyes over the ocean that now loomed just before them. Had it been so close before?

\"The Goddess has her reasons,\" she said. \"I know that, but you\'ve suffered for centuries, and I know that too. She decided it was finally time to relieve you of your burden. I would have relieved it centuries ago, if I could, but I guess that\'s why I don\'t get to be a god.\"

As Kyouko watched, wondering at how old her sister sounded, the girl crushed something in her hand, releasing it over the edge of the cliff in front of them. A moment later she realized they were flower petals.

\"In other realities I never died,\" Momo said. \"In some, I lived a full life; in others we grew to hate each other, and in yet others I, too, made a contract, and died young. There are many things that never were, many lives I would have preferred to live.\"

Her sister turned back towards her, crying this time, and Kyouko\'s heart ached to see the face of a girl who never was, reaching forward.

\"It wasn\'t your fault, *nee‐chan.* It never was. I forgive you, and I love you.\"

They embraced there, and for a moment Kyouko could see it all, all the time they would never spend together, the lives they would never live.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said, the tears pouring out uncontrollably. \"I\'m sorry. I tried. I couldn\'t imagine---father never---I should have---\"

\"No, please, stop it,\" Momo said. \"Please. I told you it wasn\'t your fault.\"

\"You don\'t *understand,*\" Kyouko said. \"When I buried you and mama, I wanted so desperately to join you, there underneath the dirt, but Mami wouldn\'t let me. She wouldn\'t let me *stay.*\"

The memory in Kyouko\'s mind overwhelmed everything, then. Mami holding Kyouko\'s hand as she sobbed, dragging her slowly away from the dirt grave where they had buried her family, telling her that it was alright, that she would learn to cope, someday, just as Mami had.

It was the right thing to do, but part of her had always hated her for it.

\"I\'m sorry you had to live through it all,\" Momo said, voice against her ear, \"but it\'s not a sin to just live, and not a sin to be happy. I know you know that, but you\'ve never believed it. It\'s been four centuries, nee‐chan, and I\'m happy here.\"

Kyouko clutched her sister\'s body in instinct, eyes snapping open, but the girl was already fading.

\"We\'ll meet again someday. We all will.\"

Then she was gone, leaving Kyouko on her knees in front of the roaring sea.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yet the vision did not end.

Kyouko had expected the vision to do so with Momo\'s disappearance, leaving her a crying wreck in front of her followers, but the world around her refused to disappear, even taunting her with a seagull that landed next to her, staring at her inquisitively.

Eventually, when she felt like her eyes had finally dried, she stood back up, wiping her arms against her shirt. Clearly the vision wasn\'t over, but then---

She stopped. The ruined church was gone, replaced by another edge to the cliff she was standing on. This time, however, there was a railing along the edge, with a small gap in the middle where it turned and arced away---a staircase downward.

Kyouko knew better than to ignore obvious hints like that, so she walked forward, grasping the railing and beginning the climb down the long, precipitous staircase. Whatever the intent of this vision was, at the moment she felt all too human---lacking the strength and finely‐tuned balance provided by her magical girl body, or even by the implants provided by Governance. It made the descent all too vertiginous, as she spent half the time reaching for strength and skill that simply wasn\'t there anymore. It made her feel young, painfully young.

Arduous minutes later she finally reached the bottom, where a picturesque, sandy beach awaited, the kind of beach she and Momo would have dreamed of visiting as children.

Her shoes dug into the fine sand, and she felt the urge to take them off.

*Momo...*

Thinking about her sister felt different now. She had always recoiled from thinking about her family, all too aware of the grief that it would trigger, all too aware that she would imagine their eyes on her, judging. It was irrational, but in all her many years, the feeling had never really left her.

It was gone now, though, and the relief she felt resembled the blissful relief that came with the disappearance of an ache that had never quite been consciously realized--- the relief of Yuma healing a missing body part whose pain she had been suppressing.

She looked up at the bright afternoon sun, wondering what she was supposed to do.

She took off her shoes and socks, placing them carefully next to the staircase. Surely in a place like this she could be confident that nothing would go wrong.

The sand felt warm under her feet as she headed down the beach. Perhaps, after Momo, the Goddess\'s intention was only that she take a break from her life to refresh and relax. Now that she was here, she was starting to realize how much she had needed it, even after spending years nagging Mami to do literally the exact same thing.

*None of us take our own advice,* Kyouko thought.

Then she stopped again, shading her eyes with the palm of her hand. In front of her, the beach was tapering away, replaced gradually by the stacks of rocks that often gathered at the edge of the sea.

And seated on a rock in the middle, another person sat, almost reclining, eyes fixed on the distant horizon.

Not just another person---the person she had come here to find.

Kyouko broke into a sprint, pushing the limits of her once‐again human body, as if afraid she would lose her if she didn\'t get there *now. She didn\'t yell, though---she had an irrational fear that doing so would cause the girl to vanish.

As she lunged over one of the boulders, fixated, she felt her footing slip as she landed, realizing to her horror that she was going to smash her fragile human bones against hard rock, without the reflexes or strength to stop it.

She lurched to a stop, finding that she had rammed into someone\'s soft arms, rather than the hard landing she had expected.

\"Oh geez, Kyouko, I remember you being less clumsy than that.\"

\"Sayaka?\" Kyouko asked, breathless.

The girl released her, allowing them to both balance precariously on the rocks.

\"At your service,\" Sayaka said, bowing slightly. \"Well, Sayaka in a manner of speaking.\"

\"Manner of speaking?\" Kyouko echoed emptily.

\"Let\'s leave that for later,\" Sayaka said, adjusting the strap of her white and blue striped bikini. \"It\'s not the most important thing right now.\"

She looked down for a moment, fiddling with her swimsuit.

\"You know, before I made my contract, I saw a swimsuit like this in the store. I thought about buying it, but the thing about white swimsuits is that they get dirty so easily when you try to use them, so I talked myself out of buying it. I changed my mind and went back, but it was gone. It\'s funny, the things you regret when you have too much time to think about it.\"

Kyouko just stood there, agape, surprised that *this* would be the topic of conversation.

\"Anyway,\" Sayaka said, shaking her head slightly. \"You can think about whether that\'s symbolic or not, but I guess...\"

Sayaka looked down for a moment, then shifted her position, turning towards the distant horizon.

\"I don\'t know what I can say,\" she said. \"I kind of just got chucked out here to talk to you, and no one really told me what to do. Sure, if I expand my perspective I can just look at the end of this conversation, but that kind of defeats the point, you know?\"

Kyouko shifted uncomfortably, wondering just what she was supposed to say to that. None of the visions others had received of the dead had been anything like *this*.

Sayaka shook her head a moment later.

\"I\'m rambling. One thing I\'d want to say is that if you were in love with me, or if you just wanted to save me from myself, you could have just *said* something, but I know that\'s not fair. I know you tried to say something, and I know I shut you down. And I know what the me from back then would have said if you tried to push any harder. Ultimately, it was my fate, more than anything.\"

Sayaka crouched down, dipping her hand into the water of a tidal pool, swirling it over the fronds and appendages of the life within. A red‐shelled crab darted deeper into the water, and a few small fish did their best to hide between the local sea urchins.

\"Let me answer the questions you want answered, then,\" Sayaka said. "No, I haven\'t been avoiding you. First off, I\'m not the one who gets to decide. Second, that\'s just not how it works here. It\'s very hard to be mad at anyone if you have enough perspective.\"

Sayaka stood back up, looking Kyouko back in the eyes. For the first time, Kyouko noticed something odd about the eyes, almost as if there was something swirling underneath---

Sayaka broke the eye contact a moment later.

\"Anyway, the nice thing about being dead is that you can learn some of the meaning of your life,\" she said. \"It\'s nothing so melodramatic as I needed to die so the MSY could live. There are plenty of worlds where I lived and the MSY still formed---but in none of those worlds do I contract. Without my contract, Kyousuke would have never had a music career. That\'s the sum and whole of it, other than some butterfly effect stuff with Hitomi\'s family and all of that. I thought it was a nice touch they named their daughter after me, even if she\'s nothing like me.\"

\"You died for something as stupid as that?\" Kyouko asked, incredulously.

\"You\'re assuming everyone lives and dies for some grand reason, but that\'s just not true,\" Sayaka said. \"It can\'t be true. The Goddess couldn\'t make it true, not with all her power.\"

She crouched back down to stir the water of the tidal pool a bit longer. A single seahorse appeared almost annoyed by the interruption, then just as quickly disappeared.

\"It\'s what I *wished* for, Kyouko,\" Sayaka said, glaring at her with sudden sharpness. \"It might not have been what I really wanted, but I thought it was important enough to sacrifice my life for. The Goddess chose to honor that.\"

Sayaka looked away from her.

\"I guess I shouldn\'t be surprised. It\'s not really in your nature to understand.\"

\"Of course I don\'t understand!\" Kyouko insisted, barely restraining herself from grabbing Sayaka by the shoulder. \"It\'s not worth your life!* Isn\'t that obvious?\"

Instead of giving any of the responses Kyouko expected, Sayaka simply... smiled.

\"You have no idea how ironic it is for you to say that,\" she said, standing back up and stretching her arms out up above her head.

\"But enough about me,\" she said, turning to face Kyouko. \"What\'s done is done, and none of it is your fault. I\'m here to tell you to move on.\"

She pointed at Kyouko with a single finger, but Kyouko simply looked away. What could she say that would faze this too‐all‐knowing version of Sayaka? It was the worst, almost like dealing with a mother who truly did* know everything.

\"I know it wasn\'t my fault, Sayaka,\" she said. \"Of course I do. The only way I could have possibly have done anything was with experience I didn\'t have. I was too young to help you.\"

\"We were all too young,\" Sayaka said, a trace of sadness lingering on the words.

The girl closed her eyes for a moment.

\"There\'s a couple of things I could say here, but they all point in the same direction,\" she said. \"You said you know it\'s not your fault, but in your heart you never really believed that.\"

\"It\'s irrational,\" Kyouko said.

\"Yes,\" Sayaka agreed.

She leaned forward towards Kyouko, making a conspiratorial expression.

\"But you know, speaking of things that are too young and *definitely your fault, isn\'t there a girl who looks *just* like me that you were sleeping with? That\'s scummy, Kyouko. Talk about January‐December. There\'s missing me, and then there\'s *missing* me.\"

Kyouko recoiled as if snake‐bit, feeling her jaw visibly drop.

\"That\'s not---\" she started to stammer, even as she realized the effort was futile.

She looked down for a moment, thinking about how to start over.

\"Well, yes, of course it was like that,\" she said, without looking up. "A cheap thrill for everyone involved, until it wasn\'t. So I ended it, because I don\'t want to get wrapped up in something like that.\"

It was strangely liberating, talking with someone who appeared to know everything.* There was no sense hiding anything, so she didn\'t have to make the effort.

But, geez, couldn\'t the messenger have been *anyone* else? The Goddess was playing a cruel trick having Sayaka berate her about this. She felt sixteen again, listening to Mami lecture her about how sloppy she was around the household.

\"Well, better me than your sister,\" Sayaka said, sardonically. \"In my opinion, anyway.\"

Sayaka waited just long enough for Kyouko to jerk in surprise again, before continuing:

\"Wrapped up in *what,* anyway? A relationship? Something long‐term? You don\'t want to settle down, is that it? You want to stay young? You\'re four hundred and sixty‐four.* Believe me, you\'re not fooling anyone.\"

Kyouko opened her mouth to give her standard retort, but Sayaka overrode her:

\"And don\'t give me that bullshit about not wanting to give into long‐term stability, and getting old like that is death. You know what stasis is? Stasis is not getting over a first crush that was *four and a half centuries* ago! A first crush who didn\'t even like you back, not in this world.\"

Kyouko cringed, feeling the words bite into her heart. They were too true to argue with.

\"So what you\'re going to do is you\'re going to visit this Kishida girl, and you\'re going to make an actual effort to make it work. I\'m not going to judge your taste in age or body types---Goddess knows you\'re not the only Ancient who prefers a younger vintage. But I\'d like you to make an attempt at emotional health, alright?\"

Kyouko stood there with her head bowed, now feeling like a schoolgirl being lectured by the principal.

\"Alright, I get it,\" she said. \"I get it. I\'m being stupid. I know that. I just---I miss you.\"

\"I know,\" Sayaka said, wrapping an arm around her shoulder. \"I miss you too. I would tell you to hurry up and get here, but that\'d be wishing you dead, plus time doesn\'t really mean anything and---\"

\"Not in this world?\" Kyouko interrupted, feeling abruptly bold enough to ask.

There was a moment of silence.

\"Ah, you\'re referring to my comment about not liking you back,\" Sayaka said. \"Yeah, well, there are possible worlds where it could have happened. Just not this one. But I do have the feelings from those worlds, somewhere within me. Speaking of which...\"

Sayaka grabbed Kyouko by the shoulders, causing her to look up.

\"The Goddess knows you have suffered,\" Sayaka said, in an oddly‐cadenced voice. \"She knows you have suffered more and longer than you should have. It is the fate we all share, but none deserves. In payment for this, she will give you a gift that she has given no other.\"

The voice grew increasingly resonant, filled with harmonics and subharmonics that no mortal instrument could ever produce. In the dark corners of her mind, Kyouko heard whispers, voices, cracks at the edges of reality.

She looked up, and found herself looking into Sayaka\'s eyes, those eyes that had looked so strange before. She could see something inside them, something endless, something...

\"What are you?\" she asked, feeling the question vanish even as she asked it.

\"What a silly question,\" the voice said.

And then Kyouko was swallowed by those eyes, and eternity burst through the seams of her mind. In one eternal moment, she saw her life as the Goddess did, in all its endless variations, all its joy and suffering. She felt it all.

---*she drove her spear through her father\'s body, driven by the rage of seeing what he had tried to do, even as the terror of what she was doing coursed through her mind*---

---*her father patted her on the cheek, saying that he had been a fool, that he finally understood now, that he forgave everything*---

---*the soul gem shattered in her hand, and the horror finally caught up with her. Mami, she had*---

---*a warm summer evening in the park with some friends from work, laughing at the idea of magic being real*---

---*the kiss passed electric through her body, her first*---

---*she sensed Sayaka\'s soul gem disappear, once and for all, and she mourned even as she tried desperately to doubt*---

---and then it was over, and she found herself blinking back at Sayaka\'s eyes, the other girl holding her head in place by the cheeks, letting go almost immediately.

\"I can\'t talk about that at all, can I?\" Kyouko said, putting one hand to her head as she staggered in place.

\"Of course not,\" Sayaka said. \"And as I\'m sure you can tell, you can\'t really remember it either. Your mind simply can\'t hold it.\"

\"What are you?\" Kyouko asked.

Sayaka smiled.

\"I am Miki Sayaka. Just Miki Sayaka. Not anything more special than that. Some day you\'ll understand.\"

The girl turned to walk away, and Kyouko knew better than to try to stop her.

With a gut‐wrenching lurch, reality fell out from underneath her, leaving her gasping on her knees in front of the Ribbon. The crowd around her murmured, but she didn\'t really care.

In the corner of her eyes, she had seen wings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"One tessa ready, Shizuki‐san!\" a squeaky, but cheerful voice said.

An oddly flexible mechanical arm delivered her dish of carefully sliced fish a moment later, wrapping around the bottom of the plate with all the expert grace of a true tentacle.

Ryouko gulped surreptitiously. Robotic arms were a common sight at conveyor‐belt sushi establishments, a single mechanical arm carefully folded in front of each patron, awaiting their command. According to her mother, they had first appeared about four decades ago, as part of a silly fad that accompanied the consumerization of formerly military robotics technology, and had never quite gone away.

\"Thank you, Tako‐san!\" Chiaki said, waving hi to the holographic mascot that drooped languidly over the edge of the counter. The mechanical arm that had delivered Ryouko\'s food raised itself up to wave back.

\"You\'re welcome!\" the voice squeaked.

Ryouko and Asami glanced at each other, then at Meiqing, who was further down the counter. The cartoon octopus mascots were cute and enormously popular with children, which explained their continued presence, despite an unfortunate resemblance to certain murderous alien invaders.

*It\'s a good thing they\'re so cartoonish,* Meiqing thought, *or they\'d have problems with veterans and PTSD.*

Ryouko nodded, as inconspicuously as she could manage. She couldn\'t help but think of the building AI for the ITG on Eurydome, which had been forced to stop using a Cthulhu avatar for the same reason.

\"Come on, Ryouko, open up,\" Asami said, holding up a pair of chopsticks with a piece of *Ahi* sashimi.

Ryouko could feel the eyes of Chiaki and Ruiko on her as she ate the proffered fish. She was pretty sure Asami was doing this intentionally, and it took a good deal of her self‐control not to blush.

She closed her eyes for a moment, though. The unexpected wiring synergy that made raw meat taste delicious to those in the military apparently extended to fish as well. It gave an entirely new dimension to sushi.

When she opened her eyes again, she found Asami looking at her expectantly, and sighed internally.

\"Come on,\" she said, picking up a piece of her tessa for Asami to eat. The girl bit down, closing her eyes and looking pleased for a long moment.

\"Get a room, girls,\" Ruiko said, rolling her eyes. \"Look, you\'re scandalizing your poor adopted sister.\"

She gestured at Sacnite, who had transitioned from staring wide‐eyed at the fish to staring wide‐eyed at Ryouko and Asami. She was seated to Ryouko\'s far left, next to Ryouko\'s mother, who was working quietly on a piece of hamachi.

\"You know, bluefin tuna went extinct in the wild centuries ago,\" Chiaki said, expertly changing the topic. \"The only reason we have it now is because some hyperclass fanatics managed to save a breeding population for themselves. They still haven\'t quite managed to reintroduce them to the oceans---all this stuff is probably still farmed in orbit, where the environment can be better controlled.\"

Indeed, the place they were in proudly advertised that they served \"No Synthesized Fish\", which also meant it was exorbitantly expensive. That was no matter, since their meal was on the invitation of a wealthy woman named Sakura Kyouko, seated directly to Ryouko\'s left.

\"Yes, I remember that,\" said woman said absently, after gulping down a cup of sake. \"Cost me a pretty penny, let me tell you, but it was worth it.\"

Chiaki\'s serene face dropped into an open gape. Ryouko didn\'t think her school friends had really quite grasped who Kyouko was.

\"That was *you?*\" she asked wondrously.

\"A lot of things were me,\" Kyouko said, crooking her mouth sardonically.

She leaned over, pointing at Ryouko\'s meal.

\"Here\'s another fun fact from an old lady. The fish that comes from produces an extremely deadly neurotoxin in some of its glands. It used to be a fine art, making sure you could eat any of the fish without killing yourself. It used to be a thrill, until implants made it so the toxin couldn\'t kill you.\"

She sniffed airily.

\"Though us magical girls have been eating stuff like this for longer than that. It used to be a popular way to show off.\"

There was a moment of silence while the rest of the party shifted uncomfortably. Kyouko seemed a bit moody, alternating between odd comments and strange silences. Even the situation itself, Kyouko offering to take Ryouko \"and friends\" out to a dinner, struck her as a bit out of character.

\"So Ryouko,\" Chiaki said, again playing the diplomat over the conversation. \"Obviously you\'ve had a bit of an exciting life recently. Us poor friends of yours only have news stories and rumors to go on. What have you been up to?\"

\"What was it like on that freaky religious colony?\" Ruiko interjected, before Ryouko could say anything. \"I can\'t believe they were doing those horrible things! Those poor girls!\"

From the corner of her eye, Ryouko saw Kyouko turn her head slightly, while Nakase gave Ruiko a carefully‐veiled look.

Governance had done a remarkably good job of keeping Sacnite\'s presence here a secret---it appeared that people trusted their nomenclators so much, all it took was a simple pseudonym to get most people to turn off their brains. It certainly helped that after the initial burst of stories, Governance had gone to some length to keep the appearances of the clones a secret, even going so far as to change the clones\' features before releasing propaganda videos. It was part of a public campaign that justified the cloud of secrecy that now surrounded X with the explanation that it was necessary to protect the privacy of "those poor girls\".

Unfortunately, that secrecy extended to Ruiko and Chiaki---neither of them had any clue who Sacnite was. She was staying with Ryouko and Nakase under the guise of an MSY program placing young orphans with girls who could be their new magical sisters---a program that, conveniently, did exist.

\"I\'m not allowed to talk about it,\" Ryouko said, casting an eye at Kyouko, who she hoped would bail her out.

\"Oh come on!\" Ruiko insisted.

\"Ryouko is right,\" Kyouko said, sitting up in her chair. \"I was there too, and there\'s nothing we should talk about. What happened there is better left in the past. You know that.\"

It was a sharp, officious rebuke coming from Kyouko, and Ruiko visibly wilted.

\"I apologize,\" she said.

\"No need,\" Kyouko said emptily, sipping some more sake.

She turned towards Ryouko.

\"So, what are you going to do now that the ITG is temporarily out of commission?\" she asked.

\"I don\'t really know yet,\" Ryouko said honestly. \"It\'s only been a short while since I got back, so there hasn\'t really been any time to think about it.\"

\"Well, you\'re not going to get a lot of time,\" Kyouko said, drinking more of her alcohol. \"Your little security guards are proof of that. You\'re not going to get left alone. If nothing else, eventually the military is going to try to summon you back if it doesn\'t seem like you\'re doing anything.\"

Ryouko looked down at her food, chopsticks paused mid‐action. Her appetite had started to desert her.

\"I know that,\" she said. \"But what am I supposed to do? All I can really do is sit here and wait for orders from *someone.* Like you said, I\'m ultimately beholden to the military. It\'s not like I can suddenly leave and go be a cook or something.\"

\"Would you be happy as a cook?\" Kyouko asked, rhetorically.

\"No,\" Ryouko answered, just as rhetorically.

For a long moment no one spoke, the silence only broken by the clatter of chopsticks.

\"It\'s my first time having sushi, yeah,\" Sacnite said, continuing a conversation Ryouko hadn\'t noticed. \"I don\'t know if this is my first time having fish. It might be.\"

\"What do you mean it might be?\" Ruiko demanded, shocked. \"How can it be your first time having fish?\"

Before Ryouko could attempt to intervene in the conversation, she felt a tap on her shoulder.

She turned her head to look, and almost jerked in surprise.

\"Director Valentin,\" Kyouko said, tilting her head in greeting. "It\'s surprising seeing you here.\"

Her tone was carefully neutral.

\"Well, I don\'t spend *all* day at the lab,\" Joanne said, placing her hands on their chairs so she could lean over. \"I was surprised to find you all here, so I thought I\'d say hi.\"

\"Hi,\" Asami said around a pair of chopsticks. Farther down the table, Ryouko\'s mother waved awkwardly.

\"How\'s the new system holding up?\" Joanne said, casting a meaningful glance at Chiaki and Ruiko. \"No glitches?\"

\"Unless you count the raw meat glitch,\" Ryouko said, putting a piece of fish in her mouth by way of emphasis.

Director Valentin laughed, a sound that seemed... somehow off.

\"Ah yes, that one,\" she said. \"I think it\'s everyone\'s favorite.\"

She ducked her head for a moment.

\"I couldn\'t help but overhear the previous topic of conversation. I promise I\'m not just being nosy, but I just had a fascinating discussion regarding the matter with Sakura‐san\'s colleague, Chitose‐san. I suppose it couldn\'t hurt for me to convey this news in person.\"

She looked at Ryouko, Asami, and Kyouko expectantly, until Kyouko finally prompted:

\"News?\" she said. \"What news?\"

Joanne closed her eyes for a moment, looking pleased with herself.

\"Well, I don\'t have to tell you that the Version Two Tactical Computer rollout has gone... a bit differently than we had anticipated. There is no question that we will soon have to reveal to the government these unpredicted results. After that, it will be necessary to do a bit of a publicity campaign to ensure the public does not grow too worried.\"

Ryouko nodded.

\"I\'m not sure where this is going, though,\" she said.

\"Well, you *are* slated to appear in an upcoming movie,\" Joanne said. "Chitose‐san is speaking with the production committee about having a script change, to more accurately reflect the existence of... Clarisse, I believe? In that case I believe the writers and actors will want to talk to you in person for the movie. Both of you.\"

Ryouko looked back blankly. She wasn\'t sure how she was supposed to feel about this.

*I don\'t know how to feel about this either,* the TacComp in question thought.

\"If Clarisse is not okay with it,\" Joanne said, \"then we do not have to reveal that you have a Version Two installed. This is strictly up to you two. I suspect the committee will get in touch with you, sooner rather than later.\"

\"I see,\" Ryouko said, rather flatly.

\"I am sorry, I rarely have to ask this question,\" Kyouko said, shaking her head. \"But what are you talking about? What does Clarisse van Rossum have to do with this?\"

Joanne smiled slightly.

\"Ask Yuma‐chan,\" she said. \"I am not allowed to speak about it yet.\"

She nodded pointedly at Ryouko.

\"I am going to say hi to your mother. A shame what happened with your parents. They were such a good couple! Well, I can\'t say I regret introducing them if you were the result.\"

With that parting shot, Joanne stepped away and headed down the row of seats.

*Yuma‐*chan*?* Kyouko thought, following the woman with her eyes. *I didn\'t know they were on such good terms. And what do you suppose she meant---*

Kyouko\'s thought stopped abruptly, with the sensation of a door slamming shut.

She shook her head.

\"Well, anyway,\" she said. \"What do you think about going shopping with me tomorrow? I have some stuff I\'d like to buy, and ordering from an online catalog is so boring.\"

Ryouko searched the other girl\'s eyes, but found what seemed to be open sincerity.

\"I\'m not doing anything else,\" she said honestly. \"I don\'t think Asami is either.\"

\"I\'d like to come too, if you don\'t mind,\" Chiaki said, looking at Kyouko with what seemed like an odd look.

\"I\'ll pencil you all in,\" Kyouko said. \"Come if you like.\"

*Isn\'t she supposed to be, like, really busy?* Asami thought, looking at Ryouko. *How does she have time to do this all suddenly?*

*I don\'t know,* Ryouko thought.

Asami turned to wave at Valentin, who was walking away to return to her own seat, a booth on the other side of the restaurant.

*I don\'t trust her,* Clarisse thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The twin suns traced wandering paths across the ceiling of the shopping complex, impossibly fast, casting their table into a complex amalgamation of partial shadows that was always in flux. Against the eerie backdrop of a too‐purple sky, it was supposed to dazzle shoppers with an alien panorama.

To Ryouko\'s slightly tired eyes, it looked fake---it hardly emitted at all in infrared or ultraviolet. The windows and sky in the Prometheus botanical gardens had been much better done.

But then, the display was hardly intended for her.

She would be glad when night arrived, as it seemed about to.

\"I remember when no one your age had any interest in coming to a place like this,\" Kyouko said, stirring her caffeinated fruit drink with a small spoon. \"I\'m still amazed they even exist.\"

\"What? Shopping centers?\" Ruiko asked.

\"Yes,\" Kyouko said. \"When I was young, they were common, but back before the Unification Wars, no one ever bothered going anywhere just to buy something. It was easier just to order everything you wanted online, assuming you had the money.\"

\"That can\'t be right,\" Chiaki said. \"Who would want to pass up the experience? Other than boys, of course.\"

*Who indeed?* Ryouko thought into the silence that followed, probing her cake with a fork.

\"Well, I guess everything old is new again,\" Kyouko said finally. "I\'d missed the experience a little. The funny thing is, no one even remembers the old name for an enclosed shopping center anymore.\"

\"What word?\"

Ryouko tuned the conversation out, uninterested. She had given up trying to figure out why Kyouko was behaving so strangely. She had been trying to ask the last time they had been alone, but Kyouko clearly wasn\'t interesting in discussing the situation.

Ryouko looked at the bags and bags of clothing that signified Chiaki and Asami\'s purchases that day---to her jaundiced eye, only if they had bought clothes for Sacnite would it have served any purpose.

Her eye lingered on Kyouko\'s single purchase. While the teenagers had wandered the boutique clothing stores, accompanied by drone attendants, Kyouko had instead chosen to while away her time in jewelry shops, casting her eye over natural gemstones that carried exorbitant prices.

\"*I\'m just looking for something to buy someone as an apology,*\" Kyouko had said when Ryouko snuck away from Asami to ask her about it. "*It\'d all be so easy if I could just buy an expensive ring, but she won\'t appreciate the money. Or the ring, for that matter.*\"

In the end Kyouko had purchased a pendant, with special directions she didn\'t allow Ryouko to hear.

*Penny for your thoughts?* Asami asked, glancing at Ryouko from the corner of her eye. As always, she had picked up that Ryouko wasn\'t really paying attention.

*I\'m just wondering about what Kyouko bought,* Ryouko thought, half‐truthfully.

*Aren\'t we all,* Asami thought. *She\'s been so secretive. It\'s a good thing they gave us these disguises.*

*Yes,* Ryouko thought.

The little devices that served to subtly adjust their appearance to fool facial recognition heightened Ryouko\'s distrust of the nomenclators. It had taken some getting used to, looking at each other with the *wrong faces, but Ruiko and Chiaki had giggled at the novelty.

There was no sense taking risks, after all. With Ryouko and Kyouko in the same place at the same time, in a very public location, the possibility that someone would put the pieces together and identify Sacnite was too likely to be ignored.

*Finally,* someone thought. *You girls are too damn hard to find.*

Ryouko turned her head slowly, exerting her self‐control to suppress the surprise even as Asami jerked in her seat. Who was it?

A familiar‐looking girl walked up to their table, drawing the looks of those seated there. It took Ryouko a moment to place the identity, though she didn\'t need her nomenclator this time.

*Kishida Maki,* she thought, a moment before she swiveled her head unsubtly towards Kyouko, who abruptly looked like she had seen a ghost.

From her initial body language, Maki had been dead set on talking to Ryouko, but now her expression was frozen, and she was staring directly at Kyouko. Kyouko\'s face might have been slightly different, but it was probably trivial for Maki to put two and two together, given that she had apparently been capable of finding Ryouko.

And in that moment, Ryouko put two and two together as well.

\"Oh, it\'s surprising seeing you here,\" Ryouko said woodenly, painfully aware that she and Maki had effectively never met. \"You and Kyouko‐san must have so much to talk about.\"

\"Yeah,\" Maki echoed.

\"Come on,\" Ryouko said, looking directly at Chiaki. \"I think we should leave these two alone and go look for clothes for Sacnite. We\'re almost done eating here anyway.\"

\"Why Sacnite?\" Ruiko asked. \"And aren\'t we being a little ru---\"

\"That\'s a great idea, Ryouko!\" Chiaki said, catching the hint perfectly even if she didn\'t understand exactly why. \"Come on, Sacnite, it will be fun!\"

Sacnite latched onto Chiaki\'s arm, looking at Ryouko wondrously. Even though Chiaki and Ruiko hadn\'t been told anything specific about Sacnite\'s situation, they had naturally sensed that she was perhaps a bit... young, and had taken a cue from Ryouko\'s treatment of her.

\"Alright,\" Sacnite said.

They hurried away from the table, picking up their bags and whatever food containers they still wanted, though Ryouko couldn\'t resist taking a look backward. The two remaining girls looked awkward, but they hadn\'t started shouting at each other, which was probably a good sign.

She also couldn\'t help but be struck by how much Kishida Maki looked like Miki Sayaka. It put in her mind odd questions, about just what Kyouko\'s intentions had been, and what they were now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I wasn\'t told you\'d be here,\" Maki said finally, grabbing the back of one of the empty metal chairs, ornate and leaf‐patterned.

\"Yes, well, I wasn\'t told you\'d be here either,\" Kyouko said, with a touch of dryness.

\"A coincidence,\" Maki said.

\"I doubt it,\" Kyouko said. \"Why were you looking for Shizuki Ryouko?\"

\"You know about my new job, I\'m sure,\" Maki said. \"They sent me to ask Shizuki‐san to pay a visit, now that she\'s available. They\'re hoping she will be willing to provide some input as to her character.\"

Kyouko pressed her lips together, making a flat almost‐smile that she hoped adequately conveyed her feelings.

Maki was right to assume that Kyouko would know about her new job---she had quietly helped arrange it. The production committee for the new movie about the Euphratic Incursion had needed artists for promotional artwork, and Kyouko had wanted Maki out of harm\'s way. It was a match made in the Goddess\'s heaven.

Kyouko was just glad she had accepted the offer. With the immediate alien threat defeated, it seemed Maki was again content to leave the front lines.

Maki would never have accepted the offer if she had known about Kyouko\'s involvement. It should have been pretty easy to guess, actually, but one of Maki\'s charm points was her relative naïveté.

\"Yeah, I heard about the job,\" she said. \"I had thought about stopping by myself, since Mami had asked me to fill in for her on the character interview.\"

She thought about continuing, and expounding on why she was almost certain this meeting was no coincidence, that this was probably a set up by Yuma or Arisu or, Goddess only knew, both of them.

But none of that really mattered, of course. Fate had delivered this opportunity back to her, even if it felt more like a disaster than an opportunity.

\"Did you get my message?\" she asked, ducking her head with what she hoped was sufficient contriteness.

\"I did,\" Maki said.

Kyouko found Maki\'s tone of voice difficult to read, but as she tilted her head back up to take a look at the girl\'s face, she instead found herself with her head tilted sideways, cheek stinging from the kind of resounding open palm slap only a fellow magical girl could deliver.

She cast her eyes over the crowds of people milling around the shopping complex. Most of them had carefully diverted their eyes politely, and she was gladder than ever for the identity‐concealing hologram projector---and that Maki\'s slap hadn\'t knocked it off her face.

\"I suppose I deserve that,\" she said.

\"You\'re damn right you do!\" Maki said, barely keeping her voice from turning into a yell. \"Do you know how long I waited for you? I kept telling myself you\'d come someday, but I was a fool, wasn\'t I? Do you even know what happened to me?\"

\"You lost your body,\" Kyouko said, rubbing her cheek. \"I know. Of course I know.\"

\"I didn\'t even know new bodies were a thing!\" Maki said. \"Do you know what kind of shock it was for me?\"

Kyouko was surprised they had told her about the clones, rather than mumbled an explanation involving advanced medicine, but said:

\"Yes, of course I know. *Knew,* I mean. I\'m sorry. I really am. It was a mistake to dump you in the first place.\"

She looked up and saw that Maki had her arms crossed, looking down at Kyouko with all the fury of a woman scorned. It was an experience that was unfamiliar to her.

\"In your message you said something about having an explanation about all this, and about Sayaka,\" Maki said.

Kyouko sighed, glancing at the people around them once again. Mercifully, they seemed to have lost interest in Maki and Kyouko\'s conversation, now that it was relatively subdued. Even so...

*Yes,* she thought. *I never talk about Sayaka because it\'s still a sore point for me, and honestly it\'s kind of embarrassing, but...*

Kyouko felt Maki\'s eyes on her, and sighed.

*Miki Sayaka was my first crush, when I was even younger than you. She died before I could even do anything, and I\'ve blamed myself ever since. The truth is, I\'ve never gotten over her.*

Maki shook her head, mild surprise briefly overcoming her scowling expression.

*I mean, that sounds like exactly what I thought it could be, but I have difficulty believing it. You? Still hung up on her after all this time?*

*Yeah, well, you see why I don\'t talk about it,* Kyouko thought. *But it\'s been nagging me all these years. It\'s why I couldn\'t really commit, you know? It\'s not a great reason, but it\'s an honest reason for why I couldn\'t really accept you. I hope you understand.*

Kyouko paused for a moment, trying to figure out how to continue.

*What I can\'t believe is that I was dumb enough to fall for you,* Maki thought. *We agreed, didn\'t we? At the beginning. That it wouldn\'t be serious like that.*

Kyouko started to give her usual flippant response, something along the lines of *Yeah, I\'m just appealing like that,* but stopped, realizing she was protecting herself instinctively again.

*Me either,* she thought finally. *On that topic, there\'s one other thing I have to show you. I don\'t look forward to it, but this discussion wouldn\'t be finished otherwise.*

She reached into her jacket pocket, grasping for the portrait that she had held onto for four centuries. She had paid for its maintenance, for the technology that would reconstruct the deteriorating image back to something that looked new, even if it wasn\'t able to repair Sayaka\'s appearance *quite* right. There was no recreating the exact details of Sayaka\'s face, not even from Kyouko\'s imperfect human memories. If it hadn\'t been for her recent vision, she wouldn\'t remember exactly what Sayaka looked like herself, except that Maki resembled her uncannily.

Maki frowned down at it for a moment.

*So what about it?* she thought. *You edited her picture to look more like me? That\'s kind of---*

*No!* Kyouko thought. *Not more like you. More like Sayaka. I\'ve always known you look just like her, but I was never confident enough to use that information to repair it. I thought... that maybe I was starting to see things, that maybe my memories from so long ago had started to fade. I was terrified of losing the past, so I never went back to have the photo retouched. Only recently was I able to... confirm that I wasn\'t misremembering.*

Maki made a worried expression.

*I really look that much like her?* she thought. *In that much detail?*

*Apparently,* Kyouko thought. *I...*

She let the thought trail off, deciding what to say.

*I confess now that we didn\'t meet by chance in that bar,* she thought. I did it deliberately, consciously, because I was lonely, and you looked so much like her. You seemed like a piece of what I had lost, and I couldn\'t let that go. Not again. That was what it was initially. But that\'s not what it is now, I swear.*

She met Maki\'s skeptical look.

*It\'s not just about what you look like,* Kyouko thought. *Not anymore. You\'re not her. That\'s obvious. If you ever met her, it\'d be obvious you two are different people. I told myself it was just about the looks, but I was lying to myself.*

She looked down at the floor. Somehow the lines had sounded better when she had planned them earlier.

*It might have started for bad reasons,* she finished, *but let\'s start it again on a new foot, okay? I... have something for you.*

She swallowed again, reaching for the single bag Ryouko and the others had left for her thoughtfully, handing it over to Maki.

*I promise it\'s enormously cheesy,* she thought, smiling slightly in an attempt at humor.

Maki gave her an unreadable look.

*I haven\'t gotten to where I am by being tentative,* Kyouko thought, even as she was aware that the self‐reassurance was itself a sign of uncertainty. Instead she simply handed the bag over and did her best to look into the empty middle distance.

\"A pendant?\" Maki said, pulling the piece of jewelry out of its box.

\"Yeah,\" Kyouko said, with painful carefulness. \"No diamonds or anything gaudy like that. I know it doesn\'t make any sense to try to impress you with money, so I just got one of those heart‐shaped pendants that has a picture inside. You should recognize it.\"

\"Yeah,\" Maki said, breathing the word out quietly. She didn\'t elaborate, but of course she didn\'t need to. Kyouko had chosen one that had sentimental value, even if it was embarrassing. After all, there weren\'t many holograms or pictures of Kyouko that had her grinning stupidly with a fistful of cotton candy next to another girl.

It was hard evidence that somewhere in her Ancient, stone‐encrusted heart the girl she had once been still dwelt, and for that she secretly prized it.

A moment later Maki withdrew the folded sheet of old‐fashioned paper that accompanied the pendant, reading it to herself for a few long seconds.

\"Was it really necessary to make the poem dirty?\" Maki said, voice oddly devoid of inflection. \"Imagine if I had tried to read it out loud. This reads like something you\'d use to hit on someone.\"

Kyouko smiled slightly, nervously, unsure if the criticism were legitimate or part of the joke it sounded like. Maki\'s eerie voice unnerved her.

\"Well, you know, I could have faked doing something more elegant, but I thought it\'d be better to write something more authentic, instead of trying to pretend to be someone I\'m not. And I thought the starfruit analogy was pretty clever.\"

\"Yeah, it was imaginative,\" Maki said, slipping the piece of paper into her coat pocket.

Kyouko found herself holding her breath despite her every intention to remain calm. What was Maki going to do?

Finally, the girl smiled slightly, reaching behind her neck to lock the pendant in place, letting it drop into the empty space below the nape of her neck.

\"Well, it\'s a bad idea, but you make a convincing argument. I... can\'t imagine what it felt like to have a friend you loved die on you. It must be like how I felt when I heard what happened to you on that damned X‐25. When you didn\'t visit me after something like that, I thought you really didn\'t care. I don\'t know.\"

Kyouko cracked a smile, using one of her TacComp\'s routines to keep herself from crying in relief.

\"You\'re the one who lost your body,\" she said. \"I... I\'m sorry to make you worry. I wasn\'t really thinking straight. Not for any of it. I don\'t think I\'ve ever thought straight, about you.\"

\"Now you\'re just sweet‐talking me,\" Maki said, smiling oddly, and raising her arms.

Kyouko was confused by the gesture, until she saw that Maki\'s eyes were watering.

She stretched her own arms out and accepted the hug, letting Maki cry into her shoulder, though she was too proud to do the same.

But for a moment, she felt the layers around her heart melt away, and she remembered the day so long ago when Oriko and Kirika had taunted her about her dead family, staying always just out of reach, until Kyouko had collapsed to her knees, exhausted, hearing Oriko\'s words sting where she was weakest.

Sayaka the rookie had saved her then, standing in front of her and reaching back to pick her up.

She could see her now, eyes firm, shining.

*I remembered what you said, Sayaka,* she thought. *You said I didn\'t deserve to die, and in all these years I\'ve never let it happen, no matter what anyone said, no matter what we had to do. I started to forget, but...*

The centuries had worn on her, as they had on Sayaka\'s stone memorial plaque. She had been told to live, but part of her had never left her family\'s grave site, buried somewhere under the soil around her church, marker lost.

But she would live. She would survive.

*Thank you,* she thought, closing her eyes and returning Maki\'s hug.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Paris,\" Ryouko said.

\"Yes, Paris,\" Kishida Maki repeated again. \"The various stakeholders have agreed that you paying a visit to Paris would be the best for everyone involved, including, and especially, you.\"

Maki\'s eyes were oddly unfocused, an unconscious gesture Ryouko suspected meant the girl was reading her words off of an internal screen. It seemed logical---the girl was awkward in her role as messenger.

Ryouko leaned onto the table, spreading the palm of her hand over her eyes. She had just gotten settled down into temporarily living quarters in Mitakihara, waiting for word from Eurydome about the status of her "gravitonics research\", when here came another message from those she was starting to think of as her handlers.

She had been given advance warning, of course, but she had spent the brief intervening period deliberately avoiding the topic. She didn\'t want to think about it. Indeed, she had managed to forget about it well enough that she hadn\'t even considered the possibility that *Maki might be the messenger Joanne had been talking about.

To be fair though, Ryouko had been distracted by other considerations. She was dying to ask what had happened between her and Kyouko while she was gone. She didn\'t know how to ask. She could only observe the pendant that Maki was wearing.

\"It does make sense, after all,\" Maki said. \"You\'re on standby while the ITG lab comes back online, so why not?\"

\"Why you though?\" Ryouko asked.

Maki looked at Kyouko for some reason, who shrugged vaguely.

\"I guess they figured we had a connection, even if it was distant, so you might be more likely to listen to me,\" Maki said, imitating Kyouko\'s shrug. \"I took the free opportunity to come visit this city again, make a few sketches of the skyline. It\'s different seeing a place in person.\"

\"Paris, though,\" Ruiko said, clasping her hands in clear envy. \"That sounds love---\"

She made a coughing noise as Chiaki elbowed her in the side less‐than‐subtly, glaring at her. Their relative heights had made it so Chiaki had hit her square in the middle of the ribcage.

\"Well I wouldn\'t mind myself,\" Asami said, clearly trying to sound even‐handed. \"I haven\'t visited any of the foreign major cities, except for a class trip to San Francisco, so it\'d be an experience, I think.\"

Ryouko hadn\'t been to Paris herself---her parents had taken her traveling often, but they seemed to be more interested in wildlife than scenery. It was a popular destination, though, and travel was cheap. She was surprised Asami had never---

*Oh. Right,* she thought, realizing what she was forgetting.

*I was afraid I was going to have to remind you,* Clarisse thought, the frisson of amusement tingling up her spine.

The offer was undeniably tempting, but she had to wonder...

\"What *exactly* are these stakeholders getting from this?\" Ryouko asked, leaning forward onto the table.

Maki smiled, looking like she expected the question, though she cast a quick glance around at Chiaki and Ruiko.

\"Well, on the one hand, Paris is one of the major centers of a certain very special MSY organization that is hoping you\'ll consent to visit. On the other hand, MSY Finance is heavily invested in the production of Orpheus,* and would love to have the opportunity to talk to you about your role in the movie.\"

Maki gave her a careful look, clearly assessing whether Ryouko understood the hidden meaning, and Ryouko wondered why the girl didn\'t just use telepathy.

\"Yes, I understand,\" she said.

She took a breath, stalling for time.

\"Well, it\'s an interesting offer,\" she continued, providing what was only the truth, \"but what exactly will I be doing there? Visiting some facilities and talking to some directors?\"

\"Well, not *just* that,\" Maki said smoothly. \"You\'ll probably be talking to the writers, marketers, pretty much everyone involved who would want to talk to you. Have you heard of Elisa Yamada?\"

Behind her, Ruiko made an odd, choked noise.

\"No?\" Ryouko said, tilting her head. \"I\'ll look it up.\"

\"No, no, don\'t worry about it,\" Maki interrupted. \"She\'s the actor who will be playing you in the movie. She\'d just like to learn some things from meeting you in person.\"

\"Ah,\" Ryouko said blankly. \"That makes sense.\"

\"Anyway, it\'s not all work,\" Maki said. \"There will be plenty of time for you to explore the city and enjoy yourself. MSY Finance has agreed to pay out a substantial reimbursement for your stay, so you will have no lack of Allocs while there.\"

\"Uh‐huh,\" Ryouko said emptily. Why hadn\'t Clarisse been mentioned yet? According to Joanne, Clarisse was part of the point of the trip, but Maki had yet to say a word about it.

\"They\'d like you to think of it as a vacation rather than an obligation,\" Maki said, smiling brightly. \"Speaking personally, it\'s a great deal, and the city is absolutely beautiful. I don\'t know why you\'d turn it down.\"

Ryouko did her best to avoid wearing her feelings on her face, even as she wanted to shake her head at the insanity of it all.

*Another offer I can\'t turn down,* she thought, directing it both at Asami and Clarisse. Instead of settling for the languid pace of usual human communication, she pushed the thought out at combat speed, so that they could try to discuss the matter in time with the conversation.

*Well, the motives of the Matriarchs involved here are clear,* Clarisse thought. *But they\'re also not really trying to hide it. They\'ve made sure it profits you as well as profit them. They seem very good at making it illogical to turn them down.*

Clarisse made sure to relay the thought to Asami as well, by traditional electronic means.

*Yes,* Ryouko thought. *But at some point you have to start wondering whether what they get is more valuable than what you get. Letting myself get constantly convinced like this can lead to bad places.*

*Yes, but it\'s also true that up until now you didn\'t know what you were going to be doing with this time,* Clarisse thought. *Whatever offer they try to make you can always be turned down. I wouldn\'t be too concerned quite yet, but in the future it might be better to have something ready to do so they can\'t come up with something for you.*

*I\'m* fifteen, Ryouko thought. *What am I supposed to have ready? And I literally just got out of the tank.*

She realized abruptly that she hadn\'t really *felt* fifteen for a long time, though. Heck, she hadn\'t felt that young a single time since what had ostensibly been her birthday.

*I know,* Clarisse thought. *I wasn\'t saying it\'d be easy, I was just saying the obvious.*

*Well, for my part I would be for just going,* Asami thought. *I know why you\'re worried, but I mean... I would have to say just take what they give you for now, and worry about their offers later. And it will be a fun trip, no matter what, even if I really prefer nature to the city.*

*Honestly, I\'m not sure there isn\'t a hidden stick here too, as well as a carrot,* Clarisse thought. *Given your status after the whole wormhole thing, I\'m sure Governance would love to use you for some kind of propaganda purpose. They might very well be involved in all this. I suspect the main reason you haven\'t already been shoved into public appearances is respect for how young you are.*

There was an expectant pause, as Ryouko sensed Clarisse was ruminating on her next comment.

*Are you sure you want the world to know I exist, though?* Clarisse thought. *That\'s what would happen if we let them do the movie the way Joanne Valentin was talking about.*

*Isn\'t that something you should be worried about?* Ryouko thought.

*Yes, but it also affects you,* Clarisse thought. *People might look at you differently. Your friends might look at you differently.*

Ryouko narrowly avoided casting an eye at Chiaki and Ruiko.

*I hadn\'t thought of that,* she thought.

*You haven\'t been thinking about it, period,* Clarisse thought.

*My natural inclination is to say it\'s up to you,* Ryouko thought. *I suppose I\'ll just have to deal with the consequences. What is your opinion, anyway?*

*I don\'t know. I\'ve been avoiding thinking about it too. I suppose there\'ll be time to think about it now, though.*

*Not if I have to make this decision now!* Ryouko thought, frustrated, even as she realized that the last statement had been one of the most human things she had ever heard Clarisse say.

*Heck, I don\'t see why not,* Kyouko thought, interjecting herself into what had clearly started to become a long discussion, even with acceleration. *Someone of your age needs to explore her options, right? I mean, I\'m not a fan of Shizuki or Kuroi by far, but it\'s your life. And if you end up spending all day stuck in the Paris party houses I promise I\'ll come drag you out.*

Ryouko let out a breath, aware that Maki and the others were still looking expectantly at her for a comment.

\"You don\'t have to make a decision right now, of course,\" Maki said. "It\'s a bit of an open‐ended offer, though of course eventually your leave time from the military is going to end.\"

\"No, that\'s okay,\" Ryouko said. \"I\'d obviously like an opportunity to talk it over with my parents first, but that probably won\'t take more than a day. It sounds like a great opportunity, so I\'m definitely inclined to take it.\"

\"That\'s great!\" Maki said, quite sincerely.

Ryouko did her best not to let a frown show on her face.

Thus far, she couldn\'t deny that she was getting to explore the world, but was Paris really somewhere no one else had ever been before? Obviously not.

But X‐25 had been, and maybe her wish was just biding its time. After all that had happened, she couldn\'t deny that she was being given opportunities no one else was. It just seemed to come with a sizable helping of being entangled inextricably with the undercurrents of the world around her. Shizuki, Kuroi, the Mitakihara Four, whoever had tried to kill her, and even the Goddess herself seemed determined to weave her into their plots.

*Well, you asked to see the world,* Clarisse thought. *Maybe you\'re just being shown another facet of it.*

*I suppose that makes sense.*

\"Well, let me know by tomorrow then, okay?\" Maki said. \"You can just send me a message. I\'ll leave you all alone then.\"

The girl got up and walked away, Kyouko trailing her a few seconds later.

Kishida Maki was only about a decade older than her, but seemed so much better put together, so much more in tune with what she wanted out of life. Ryouko couldn\'t help but hope that she could get like that too, someday.

\"You are *sooo* lucky,\" Ruiko said, once Maki and Kyouko were out of earshot. \"Getting to go to Paris and meet Elisa! I can\'t even try to imagine it without swooning.\"

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko echoed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nadya had wanted to meet in St. Petersburg, among the angelic statues of the mountain‐sized Memorial Tower, which looked like it had been dreamt up by a crazed, drunken tsar determined to build his own Tower of Babel. Instead, Clarisse had insisted on meeting in a boring café in Paris, giving her usual vague reasons about historical vibrations or something like that.

So here they were, Clarisse politely letting her take a swig of her drink before pinning her with those pretty violet eyes of hers.

\"I wanted you to take a look at this,\" she said.

Nadya sighed lightly. She had wanted to settle in a bit more.

\"What is it?\" she asked, tilting her head slightly.

Before Clarisse could answer the question, Nadya glanced away for a moment, turning in her chair to give a rude gesture to a passing pedestrian.

She turned back to find Clarisse laughing at her behind one hand, lady‐like and demure in a casually affected kind of way.

\"These French are so judgmental,\" Nadya complained. \"So what if I want to drink in the afternoon? In Russia no one would bat an eye. I think at my age I\'ve earned the right to have a few drops.\"

Clarisse smiled.

\"You misunderstand, Nadya. They don\'t mind the alcohol, only that you are drinking vodka rather than wine.\"

\"As I said, judgmental.\"

Clarisse laughed quietly, and the color that rose in her cheeks served to accentuate her freckles.

\"Well, anyway, what is it?\" Nadya asked.

Instead of answering in speech, Clarisse merely looked her in the eye, and a small file arrived in Nadya\'s secure mail a moment later.

*Some of my contacts in the Telepaths\' Guild came through for us, Clarisse thought.

Nadya frowned, taking a look at the plain, unornamented text file, a rarity in these decadent days.

> GRACIA PEREZ: \"I do not agree with this conclusion. I have observed her for months now, and I am almost certain she has undergone a Reformat.\"
>
> COUNCILOR 4: \"The MHD, as well as our investigators, have noted the same anomalies you have, and have concluded that they are idiosyncratic.\"
>
> GRACIA PEREZ: \"Again, I do not agree. They do not know her as I do.\"
>
> COUNCILOR 2: \"Unauthorized Reformatting is a serious offense, if it could be proven.\"
>
> COUNCILOR 3: \"But it is more common than we like. Might Miss Virani have sought out a Reformat for self‐therapy?\"
>
> GRACIA PEREZ: \"I refuse to believe so. It is not like her, and the MHD shares my assessment that it does not suit her personality.\"
>
> COUNCILOR 4: \"Well, what evidence do you have to dispute our investigators? We cannot just take your word over theirs. If they say she has not been mind‐altered, then we cannot dispute that without further *evidence*.\"
>
> GRACIA PEREZ: \"I am sorry. I can only go on my previous assertions.\"
>
> COUNCILOR 5: \"The Guild has already spent substantial resources attempting to verify your allegations, Miss Perez. It does not seem that this Council is amenable to further expenditures, I am sorry to say. Your request is denied.\"

Nadya looked up at Clarisse, eyes conflicted.

\"Why didn\'t she ever tell me if she thought something like this might be true?\" she asked, referring to Gracia.

\"The Telepaths\' Guild is extremely secretive,\" Clarisse said, \"and for good reason, I might add. She is too young to run the risk of talking to you. I wouldn\'t be offended.\"

Nadya shook her head, not because she thought Clarisse was wrong, but out of dismay.

\"Is there more to this than just this excerpt?\" she asked.

*The Guild lost most of these transcripts in an incident a few years back,* Clarisse thought. *Someone wiped a large portion of the records from that month, and they still have not solved the mystery. It probably doesn\'t have anything to do with this---there are plenty of people who might want to destroy some of the Guild\'s secrets---but it does mean this excerpt is all that exists. If we want more, we will probably need to ask Gracia ourselves. I thought that you\'d be the appropriate person to do that.*

\"I am,\" Nadya agreed.

She gulped down what remained of her vodka in disgust, straight down the throat.

\"I don\'t like it,\" she said.

> At the end of the Unification Wars, Paris had the enviable position of being one of only a few major urban centers to have survived the conflict mostly intact, with only a modicum of nuclear damage. After the revolution that precipitated the fall of France\'s last independent government, Paris had served as a vital conduit of EDC economic and military command and control, and the postwar state of the city reflected this.
>
> Like the other remaining economic and political centers---San Francisco, Shanghai, and London, among others---the city was packed to bursting with refugees, governmental bodies, military personnel, and even the Pope. As such, it was one of the first candidates for the EDC and later Governance\'s grand plan to mitigate the soul‐crushing congestion of large cities---massive vertical growth, combined with elevated traffic tubes and walkways, to turn a two‐dimensional city into a veritable human hive.
>
> Parisians balked, offended by the attempt to transform the traditional, familiar skyline of Paris into a techno‐modern city of skyscrapers. The nature of Paris had survived centuries of cataclysm, turmoil, and development, and they would not have it be destroyed by even a Utopian world government, whatever its intentions.
>
> In the end, after extended mass protest and hurried internal negotiation, a different solution was reached, for a different kind of city. The skyline of Paris would be preserved by building the hive underneath* the city instead, in the kind of catacombs that would have to be dug anyway to accommodate Governance\'s plans for vast underground computing centers.
>
> The concern was raised that in living underground, Parisians would start to become an agoraphobic people, out of touch with the concerns of those above. A uniquely Parisian solution was found to *that concern---the city\'s artists and architects would be mobilized to design the city\'s new underground districts from the ground up, a one‐time opportunity to put their imprint on a truly vast project, and one that would remind those living below of the glories above. A city that would encompass, as much as possible, all that Earth had to offer , and that would serve as last‐ditch recourse for the residents of Earth disenchanted with their lives elsewhere〉①.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"This is your stop, *la grotte éclatante,*\" the railcar said, gliding to a gentle stop.

Ryouko blinked up at the distant ceiling of yet another of Paris\'s underground districts, here embroidered by patterns of crystals that glowed a soft, milky white. Every one of the districts they had passed on their trip from the starport had possessed unique lighting, which she assumed reflected their character somehow. It seemed entirely possible to have a good time just traversing the city by railcar without ever stepping outside, though she could easily imagine getting tired of the endless event announcements and artistic emplacements that graced the tunnel walls.

\"There is a reason Paris is called *La Ville‐Lumière, mademoiselle,*\" the railcar said pleasantly, guessing her train of thought expertly. "Have a wonderful stay in Paris.\"

*That can\'t possibly be the reason,* Clarisse thought, as Ryouko stepped gingerly out onto the street. *The underground districts and railways weren\'t built until after the Wars.*

*Artistic license, I\'m sure,* Ryouko thought.

She turned halfway, watching Asami hold Sacnite\'s hand as she stepped out after her. The family‐sized railcars Paris used for personal transportation were stylized differently than she was used to---they were boxy and ornate, rather than smooth and aerodynamic. A concession to aesthetics, she had to assume.

\"It\'s so pretty,\" Sacnite said, staring up at the speckled ceiling. "It was nothing like this back at the colony.\"

Ryouko and Asami shared an uneasy look. Sacnite had taken to referring to her former life as \"the colony\", and while it was certainly logical for her to reference it for comparison, it always brought to everyone else a natural sense of unease.

They let her stand there for a long moment, taking in the sights. They had finally decided to stabilize her biological age at a carefully‐chosen eight‐and‐a‐half, neither too old nor too young. There she would stay for a couple of years, at least, while the MHD did its best to feed her \"diversifying\" experiences, whatever it took to lessen the sting of losing the false memories that had once defined her life.

Today she was wearing a bright white sundress that Asami had selected for her, one that seemed to positively glow under the light of the district, creating a striking contrast with the color of her skin.

\"Come on,\" Asami said, kneeling slightly to look the girl in the eye. "Let\'s go have a look around.\"

They started down the long boulevard, flanked on one side by the activity of the underground inter‐district rail system, and on the other by a line of preindustrial‐style buildings, though closer inspection revealed a hodgepodge of technological attachments and disguised viewscreens that served to remind the viewer that, no, this wasn\'t really archaic‐era Europe.

They were all tiny buildings by Ryouko\'s standards, which was unusual for a major metropolis. Paris was a very different city from Mitakihara, or indeed most of the other cities she had been to. Instead of densely packed urban centers filled with towering skyscrapers and traffic tubes, Paris was instead a hive of underground districts, the buildings in each district as squat and short as those in the colonies, but layered over and over into numerous underground levels.

This particular district seemed designed to evoke the impression of being in nineteenth‐century nighttime France, and was filled with wooden‐looking signs, narrow side passages, and gloomy streetlamps. In the distance, a small set of stone lamps led up to a fountain emplacement.

\"Where are we going?\" Sacnite asked.

\"To our hotel,\" Asami explained. \"We decided we would walk through the city a little, rather than call a taxi to take us there. The buildings are pretty, aren\'t they?\"

\"Yeah, I think so,\" Sacnite agreed.

Standing isolated to one side, Ryouko shook her head at herself glumly. When it came to interacting with Sacnite, she had thus far allowed her mother and Asami to take the lead. With her mother gone---she had left them at the starport to \"meet a colleague\", the contrast became painfully obvious. She didn\'t really know how to communicate with someone so young, so without understanding of the world. It was discomfiting, because she remembered being vaguely annoyed with her own father for never seeming to know how to deal with her. Now, it seemed, the shoe was on the other foot.

She felt a tug on her sleeve, and blinked, snapping out of her brief reverie.

She founded Sacnite pointing at something across the street, and it took her a moment to realize the girl was pointing at a gelateria, the sign festooned with balloons for no clear reason.

Ryouko tilted her head questioningly, while Clarisse whispered in her ear that it was a specialty shop dedicated to serving gelato, which Ryouko mostly knew as a special dense ice cream you could ask the synthesizer for.

\"I\'ve never had any,\" Sacnite said. \"Not really. The colony didn\'t produce any. I remember... a festival, on the surface, where they served some, from the synthesizers. But that was it, and I... can\'t remember what it was like. Only that it was good.\"

Ryouko took a breath to steady herself.

\"Please? *Nee‐chan?*\"

Ryouko swallowed, wondering who had told Sacnite to call her that.

\"Alright,\" she said.

She experienced a moment of confusion, uncertain how to cross the street without the benefit of pedestrian skyways, before Clarisse nudged her in the direction of a specially‐designated crossing area.

They paused at the entrance to the gelateria, just long enough so that Sacnite could stare at the balloons before raising a hand to bop one, sending the whole set twirling.

The interior of the gelateria was as ornate as the buildings outside, the edges of the glass display case ringed with white and bronze metal embroidery, tracing out bees and flowers. Ryouko started to shake her head at the decadence of a specialty shop that served nothing but gelato, but was interrupted by Sacnite dashing forward to press her face and hands against the glass.

The human attendant---another decadent luxury!---smiled indulgently at Sacnite, though she seemed a bit confused at how excited the girl was. Asami smiled back, while Ryouko peered instead at Sacnite\'s wide eyes as she examined the flavors on sale.

*Is something wrong?* Asami thought.

Ryouko didn\'t answer, looking away.

She had always been so tired of life on Earth, so much so that she had wished to get away from it. She had feared that Paris would be more of the same, but having Sacnite here seemed to give it all new vigor. Despite it all, she found herself, just a little, possibly enjoying herself, as if Sacnite\'s enthusiasm were contagious.

It was deeply confusing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The three of them spent an inordinate amount of time standing inside the lobby of their hotel, peering up at a distant, arched ceiling hanging with light fixtures.

Ryouko and Asami had gotten more used to colonial conceptions of space and design on Eurydome, and in truth had started to feel a bit cramped in the claustrophobic environs of Mitakihara City.

Ryouko was astounded simply at the amount of space that was being wasted. By her eye, augmented by a few simple implant estimations, there was space for a full three stories in the air above them, floors that could be filled with rooms and people. It was the kind of extravagance she had been trained to expect in massive public structures and monuments, not private structures.

\"You ever see anything like it?\" Asami wondered openly.

\"A couple of times, while traveling,\" Ryouko said. \"But that was all monuments. The St. Petersburg War Memorial, the Capitol Memorial, that kind of thing.\"

\"You\'re lucky,\" Asami said.

Ryouko turned to look at Sacnite, who had simply fallen silent, ice cream cone in hand. She couldn\'t imagine what it was like, after having spent your whole life in narrow underground rooms, spending your nights with dozens of other girls.

\"Well, good afternoon to you too.\"

Ryouko managed to suppress a startled jerk, turning to face the source of the greeting.

Kuroi Nana was standing next to her, almost right in her face, gazing at her with an odd expression. Sacnite was openly staring back. Unless Ryouko missed her guess, Sacnite was surprised by the new girl\'s resemblance to her adoptive mother.

\"Where\'s your mother?\" Nana asked.

\"She\'s visiting some colleagues,\" Ryouko said, taken aback. She wasn\'t sure what her aunt was doing here, or what her behavior signified.

Nana nodded to herself, then turned to face Sacnite, bending down slightly.

\"And here\'s the girl herself. How are you doing, Sacnite? Are your sisters taking care of you? It looks like it.\"

She gestured at the ice cream even as Sacnite nodded in vague assent. Nana nodded back again, as if she were verifying something in her own mind.

Ryouko wanted to ask why her aunt was in Paris. It seemed too much of a coincidence to be mere chance, but she didn\'t know how to voice the question.

\"I\'m on a bit of a break,\" Nana said, following Ryouko\'s thoughts uncannily. \"When I\'m on standby, I usually stay in Paris, since it\'s where so much of the organization operates out of. That\'s privileged information, but I heard you were going to be coming, so I thought I\'d take some time to visit my favorite niece. Nieces now, I guess. Do you know when your mother will be rejoining you?\"

Ryouko shook her head.

\"Unfortunately, no,\" she said.

Nana looked around at the three of them, her eyes seeming to linger for a moment on Asami, who was making a studiously empty expression.

\"Well, get settled in and I might be able to show you around. You don\'t have anywhere else to be right now, do you?\"

Asami and Ryouko glanced at each other.

\"Not really, no,\" Ryouko said. \"We\'re not supposed to visit the studio until later, so we were just going to wander around and look for a place to eat.\"

Nana glanced at Sacnite.

\"Well, I know a good place to do that in. You had your bags delivered to your room, I assume?\"

Ryouko nodded. Picked up by drone at the airport, because they hadn\'t wanted the trouble of keeping track of it as they moved.

\"Alright, then you don\'t have to go your rooms until late. Follow me, and don\'t gawk so much. You look like tourists.\"

Instead of turning to lead them away, she turned and bent down towards Sacnite, lifting the girl bodily off the floor. The startled girl nearly dropped the remains of her ice cream, and only a lightning‐quick reaction by Asami saved it.

Nana giggled to herself almost childishly, and the tableau of her picking up Sacnite---who after all was tall enough to not be *that* much shorter---struck Ryouko as a bit absurdist.

\"Geez, I\'m not a kid,\" Sacnite said, offended, in a statement that only heightened the surrealism.

The girl kicked her legs slightly, but didn\'t try to escape.

\"I know,\" Nana said, setting her back down. \"I just wanted to have some fun. It\'d attract attention carrying someone your size around too easily.\"

In fact, it appeared they had attracted some attention already. A girl across the lobby was staring unsubtly at Ryouko. She probably recognized Ryouko from the news broadcasts, a not‐unusual occurrence now that Ryouko wasn\'t going to pains to avoid being recognized.

Nana finally turned to leave, leading the other girls back towards the main entrance of the hotel. It occurred to Ryouko that the situation was a good metaphor for her life, her aunt showing up uninvited to lead them off in an uncertain direction.

\"Where are we going?\" Asami asked, loping forward to catch up with Nana.

\"The Neige District,\" Nana said, maintaining a brisk pace. "Unfortunately, we\'re going to have to get on the railcars to get there, but it will be worth it, I promise.\"

\"The snow district?\" Ryouko echoed, translating the word in her mind. "What\'s *that* one like?\"

\"Well, there\'s snow,\" Nana explained.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was snow indeed---it turned out the whole district was kept at a temperature just below freezing, on the edge of comfort for a denizen of the Future era, though Ryouko noticed quite a few people bounding about in coats, mittens, and woolen hats.

Ryouko breathed on her hands, watching the misted air weave its way around her fingers. The bench she sat on felt icy and cold.

Their original plan to dine in a fine French establishment was currently on hold, due to Sacnite spotting a group of local kids having a snowball fight. They had agreed it was more important for Sacnite to experience some socialization than to eat some food they didn\'t really need.

\"What makes Paris what it is now isn\'t the monuments or sights, but the diversity of life it provides,\" Nana said, reappearing to loom over her. \"People live here because there\'s so much to experience, all of life in so confined a space. There are some who never leave the tunnels.\"

Instead of joining Asami, Nana, and Sacnite in entertaining the local children, Ryouko had opted to take a break, keeping her thoughts to herself.

Now, she shook her head, both at Nana\'s statement and in bemusement at her aunt\'s ability to again say something so relevant to her thoughts.

\"There is no way all of life is just in one city,\" Ryouko said. \"That can\'t be true, by definition.\"

\"Just so,\" Nana said, taking a seat next to her.

\"You know, you\'re not really very much like your mother,\" she said. "Naka‐chan would have said that it was wiser to explore everything the city has to offer, before trying to find something else.\"

Ryouko shrugged. It wasn\'t easy to craft a response to something like that.

\"I\'m not my mother,\" she said.

\"But you\'re conflicted,\" Nana said.

It wasn\'t a question. Ryouko found it vaguely irksome for an older magical girl to flaunt their greater insight so openly, but had to admit that it had a certain efficiency to it. Why dance around the issue, after all?

She sighed.

\"I was tired of Earth, tired of what it had to offer,\" she said. \"I asked an Incubator for the chance to explore the world, to see what no one else ever had. I have to wonder what I\'m doing here, in Paris of all places. This is probably about as Earth as you can get. The whole city is a celebration of human heritage.\"

Nana smiled slightly, crookedly.

\"Paris is as much a part of the world as anywhere else is. There are inner worlds as well as outer.\"

\"What do you mean by that?\" Ryouko asked, though she suspected she knew.

Nana shook her head.

\"This city is, if nothing else, a mirror,\" she said. \"By design, everyone should find something they\'re looking for here. That was the way the postwar architects designed it. There is no one who finds nothing for themselves here. The real question is: Is what you find here enough?*\"

Ryouko turned her head, looking the other girl in the eyes. They looked painfully familiar.

Her aunt broke the eye contact, casting her eyes over at Asami, who was cleaning snow out of Sacnite\'s hair, even though her hair was perfectly capable of cleaning itself.

Ryouko opened her mouth to speak, but it was Nana who spoke first.

\"I like to think of the City of Lights as the City of Lost Souls, lured in like moths to a flame. I first came here when I was only a little older than you, brought here by Homura‐san, so many years ago.\"

She inspected her soul gem ring for a moment, before continuing:

\"She let me enjoy myself in the city, all expenses paid, nothing restricted, as long as I fulfilled her expectations in magic and book learning. After all the problems I was having with my family at home, it seemed like freedom.\"

Ryouko watched her aunt\'s face expectantly, but the girl didn\'t continue.

\"And?\" she prompted.

\"It was fun,\" Nana said. \"I asked Homura‐san if there was even anything to the world that couldn\'t be found here. It seemed that Governance had made Eden on Earth. She said---\"

Nana tilted her head slightly, oddly, so that Ryouko started to wonder what was going on.

\"If Eden is so grand, then why did God see fit to cast man out of it?\" she said, in a startling facsimile of Homura\'s voice, which Ryouko only knew from recordings and movies. \"If the divine is omniscient, then why permit the serpent in the garden? It was Eve who ate fruit from the tree of knowledge, but it is clear that the fruit is what makes us human---the ability to be dissatisfied with Eden, the strength and the intelligence to survive in the barren wilderness, the will and the longing to build our own Eden in the wasteland. The very traits that supposedly make us a mirror of the divine. Is Eve the villain or the hero?\"

Nana paused, letting Ryouko digest the words.

\"A quote the Cult would no doubt love to get their hands on,\" Nana said, in her normal voice, unaugmented by Black Heart implants. \"Though I am unsure whether they would release it, or bury it quietly.\"

Ryouko thought for a moment, even as Nana glanced around for anyone within earshot.

\"It is the nature of this world that we can never build Eden,\" Nana continued, quoting Homura again. \"There will always be those who are this dissatisfied. It is they who will always be the most powerful of our kind, since the nature of magic is a rejection of the world as it is. They are also the most dangerous of us, the most valuable, and the most rare. I brought you here to understand what that truly entails. If you are to be my apprentice, then you must cast off the world, and wander in the wilderness, as I once did, and truly understand where magic comes from.\"

Nana stopped, clearing her throat, and Ryouko could only shake her head in dismay.

\"She really said that?\" Ryouko asked.

\"Literally like that,\" Nana said. \"I thought I was being preached to, but she meant it. I spent the next decades of my life on the frontier, carrying out little assignments, trying to be what she wanted me to be. I think I disappointed her. That\'s why I eventually stopped being her student.\"

\"That seems really harsh,\" Ryouko said, saying the only thing she could think of.

\"Also a little crazy, right?\" Nana said. \"I really started to wonder about her, but then she slaughtered an entire squid invasion force on New Athens. It\'s hard to argue with that.\"

Nana idly kicked some of the snow accumulated at the foot of their bench.

\"That went a little off‐topic, I admit,\" she said, \"but there was a point to it. There is no shame in being lured in by the city, no matter what your wish was. Not everyone can be Akemi Homura or Clarisse van Rossum. I tried, but I couldn\'t do it. That being said, there is also no shame in following in my footsteps, and traveling the stars. If you don\'t, the \'what if?\' will be stuck in your head forever.\"

Ryouko felt something land on her hair, brushing it aside instinctively with one her hair tendrils. She looked up.

\"It\'s snowing again,\" Nana said. \"I suppose we better get into that restaurant. Listen, tomorrow you\'ll be visiting the movie studio, and then Shizuki Sayaka is going to do her absolute best to pull you into her clutches, by showing you everything that is grand in life here. If that doesn\'t suit your tastes, I\'ll be there afterward to show you your other options. Then it will be up to you.\"

Ryouko blinked.

\"Was this a *recruiting pitch?*\" she asked, with sudden insight.

\"Maybe,\" Nana said, looking down the sidewalk.

For a moment, they watched Sacnite look up at the sky in wonder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Somehow, despite all she had heard from Chiaki and Ruiko about the way actors nowadays worked hard to \"get into\" their roles, Ryouko had never quite internalized what that really meant. After all, following celebrity actresses had never really been her cup of tea, nor did she really watch that many movies, so why pay that much attention?

That was how she had ended up nearly dropping her forkful of cake as her doppelgänger walked into the room, dropping into the chair across from her and making eye contact with soulful eyes.

It wasn\'t so much the appearance---which was subtly off, even ignoring the slightly emphasized bust size---as the mannerisms, right down to the manner of walking. Five minutes ago, Ryouko couldn\'t have honestly answered if she could recognize her own gait. It seemed she could, and it was frankly disturbing to see.

\"Shizuki Ryouko, I infer?\" the girl across the table asked rhetorically, opening the conversation in Human Standard.

Ryouko swallowed, telling herself that there was, after all, nothing that* freaky about the situation, not compared to the numerous combat scenarios she had been in, both virtual and real.

\"Yes,\" she said. \"Elisa Yamada?\"

\"Yes.\"

There was a moment of silence, and then Elisa coughed, visibly changing her demeanor. Asami, who was watching from the seat next to Ryouko, wore an expression that suggested she might as well have just seen Ryouko grow two heads.

\"Well, as I\'m sure you\'ve heard,\" Elisa said, \"I\'m slated to play you in the upcoming movie, so I thought it\'d be useful to meet you in person. I\'m glad you could make it.\"

Elisa stuck out a hand for Ryouko to shake, which she did a moment later.

\"As you can see, I\'ve gone quite a ways already in terms of getting into character, mostly based on already existing footage of you. It does help that I sort of looked like you to start with, as I\'m sure your friends have teased you about before.\"

\"Uh‐huh,\" Ryouko mouthed emptily, wondering what to say.

Her friends had, in fact, never teased her about that in particular. She had looked up Elisa Yamada earlier, and the half‐Argentinian, half‐Japanese actress had only borne a slight resemblance to Ryouko. Given that, and that Elisa was only slightly younger than her grandparents and was definitely *not* a magical girl, Ryouko had been skeptical about her ability to carry off the role, even with ample CGI assistance. That worry had clearly been unfounded.

\"I don\'t know how to ask this,\" she said finally, \"but uh, how exactly do you look so much like me?\"

\"Well, it\'s a little bit of a lot of things,\" Elisa said. \"Some specialized implants, a little bit of makeup, that kind of thing. You\'re probably surprised at my age---well, Governance makes a special exception for actors like me. I can\'t change ages quite as quickly as you magical girls can, but I already happened to be pretty close for another role, so...\"

\"That\'s a little weird, to be honest,\" Asami said.

\"Yes, but probably not that much weirder than having a tactical computer on your spine, if you don\'t mind my saying so,\" Elisa said. "Or, you know...\"

Elisa gestured with one hand vaguely in Ryouko\'s direction.

Ryouko felt a sensation of unease percolate from inside her, but Clarisse said nothing. She still had not heard anything from her TacComp about how she intended to deal with all of this, and was frankly a little worried. It seemed to her like they were both unprepared.

\"I suppose that\'s fair enough,\" Ryouko said.

*I can\'t believe you can just sit there like that,* Asami thought, without looking at Ryouko. *I would be freaking out. Goddess, I* am freaking out.*

*I don\'t know,* Ryouko thought. *I guess it\'s just... I don\'t know how else to respond.*

\"Well, uh, are you going to ask me any questions?\" Ryouko asked finally, after Elisa had sat silently for a long moment.

\"I\'m still waiting for someone,\" Elisa said, as a drone silently rolled in next to her, lifting a plate of strawberry cream cake identical to Ryouko\'s own onto the table. \"Didn\'t they tell you?\"

\"They didn\'t,\" Ryouko said.

\"Well, I guess we can wait,\" Elisa said, shrugging. \"You want an autograph? The report on you said you didn\'t really care for that kind of thing, but I\'m sure you\'ll have a friend who would love to have it, or maybe you could sell it online.\"

Ryouko looked at Asami, who nodded yes as subtly as she could manage, which was to say not that subtly at all. Was Asami a fan?

As Elisa expertly signed the back of a proffered tablet with an etch pen, Ryouko cast her gaze back and forth between Elisa\'s face, hands, and cleavage. The combination of features unnerved her, like watching a fun‐house mirror version of herself. Elisa had dropped the pretense of imitating Ryouko\'s behavior, but somehow that only made the resemblance more surreal, almost as if... as if she had walked in one day to find Mami eating a piece of cake with her bare hands, or something else equally uncouth.

Elisa drummed the table with her hands, a mannerism that seemed distinctly un‐Ryouko. Ryouko resisted the urge to imitate the action. She should have felt thankful, she supposed---any more eerie similarity and she would have felt obligated to start searching her hotel room for hidden cameras.

\"How have you been, uh, gathering information to prepare for the role?\" Ryouko asked. \"Besides this meeting, I mean.\"

\"Mostly footage of you provided from Governance,\" Elisa said. \"And you know, some of your habits, like what foods you order a lot. Mostly stuff from the military, actually. We also did some long‐range interviews of some of the people who knew you, some of the other team members, that sort of thing. Natural in the course of this work. Nothing too* private, of course.\"

Somehow Ryouko didn\'t feel all that reassured.

\"Speaking of that, do you have anything *interesting* about Ryouko you\'d like to tell me?\" Elisa asked, looking at Asami and smiling mischievously. \"I can keep a secret.\"

The doppelgänger winked broadly, and Ryouko darted a glance at Asami, who was developing an odd look on her face. She wouldn\'t really...

\"Well,\" Asami said, with a devious look. \"Sometimes she\'ll just take her cake and eat it straight with her hands, no forks or anything.\"

\"Like this?\" Elisa asked, picking up her slice of cake from the back and biting straight into it.

\"Yeah, just like that!\"

Ryouko bit her lip, carefully schooling her expression. Somehow, she had expected something much worse, and didn\'t know what that said about her.

\"That\'s definitely going into the movie,\" Elisa said, and Ryouko looked down, hiding her expression. She knew she should have been mortified, but...

\"Well, uh, what exactly are we waiting for?\" she asked, carefully avoiding Asami\'s snickering eyes.

Elisa tilted her head.

\"Hmm?\" she asked, in a way that made Ryouko almost certain Elisa was just toying with her.

Before Ryouko had a chance to ask the question again, though, the door slid open behind Elisa, and Nakihara Asami dove through it a moment later, showing all the signs of having sprinted to the location.

It took Ryouko disturbingly long---nearly three seconds---to realize that the scenario she had just outlined made no sense, and she even turned to look at the real Asami from the corner of her eye.

\"By the Goddess,\" Asami said, standing up out of her chair.

She circled her doppelgänger slowly, moving her head up and down to look at the other girl head and foot, as if inspecting her for every possible errant detail that could be used to prove who was the real Asami, and who was the fake.

The other girl blushed and shrunk under the sudden attention, and Ryouko found herself unable to decide whether that was an authentic reaction, an imitation of Asami, or both.

Elisa stood up, just a little hastily, and took the other girl by the shoulders protectively.

\"Ah right,\" she said. \"Let me introduce Airi Nagato. Well, Nagato Airi in Japanese name order. She\'s, uh, well, my apprentice basically. She\'s about your age, actually. I know the nomenclator might be having trouble with the weird faces and all.\"

Truthfully, Ryouko hadn\'t even tried to use the nomenclator---she and Asami had looked up their actors and read their biographies the previous night, including about Airi\'s age. Asami was being a bit intrusive, yes, but...

Just to see what would happen, Ryouko ran her nomenclator on the two girls. It returned, quite confidently, \"Shizuki Ryouko\" and \"Nakihara Asami\".

*Just another reason not to trust these things,* she thought.

Asami backed away from Airi.

\"Sorry, I didn\'t mean to stare,\" she said.

Ryouko couldn\'t help but think that, if Asami didn\'t mean to stare, getting up and walking in a circle around someone was definitely the wrong way to do things.

\"It\'s alright,\" Airi said, ducking her head slightly. \"It takes some getting used to. It\'s a bit eerie for me too, meeting the girls we\'ve been training to act as. It\'s my first time going all the way, doing the face and meeting the original people and all of that.\"

\"It\'s her first time on a production like this,\" Elisa said, with a vague hint of pride.

\"That\'s pretty cool,\" Asami said, while Ryouko was still trying to decide what to say.

\"Shizuki Ryouko,\" Ryouko said a moment later, standing and offering a hand to Airi. She was pretty late to the social nicety, she realized.

\"Anyway,\" Elisa said, after a careful pause. \"Let\'s sit back down, shall we?\"

Elisa gestured back towards the glass conference table they had shared, and they moved to follow the instruction.

\"I have typically found question‐and‐answer interviews to be dry and painful, at least when the subject is readily available on hand,\" Elisa said, activating the hologram projector built into the table. \"I have something much more interesting in mind.\"

The hologram switched rapidly through a few displays of what appeared to be a scattered montage of familiar people and places---it took Ryouko a moment to notice the labeling indicating that it was concept art for the film.

\"I think the easiest way to learn about someone is by observation, so before we do anything, we\'re just going to take you two on a tour of the set,\" Elisa said. \"Nothing special---most of the really fancy stuff is computer‐generated anyway, but we like to do some physical sets for the actors to work on without having to resort to VR.\"

She looked around at Ryouko and Asami to make sure they were paying attention.

\"After that, we\'re going to break into role‐playing sessions,\" she said. \"We\'re going to do some key scenes from the movie, but we\'re going to break up so that I\'m paired with Miss Nakihara here, and Airi will be paired with Miss Shizuki here. You girls get the idea?\"

Ryouko and Asami shared a glance.

\"You want me to... pretend like Nagato‐s---er, Miss Nagato is Asami?\" Ryouko asked, almost fumbling the Standard honorific.

\"Basically,\" Elisa said. \"And vice versa. Don\'t worry; you don\'t have to act that well. It\'s partly just for fun, and partly to get a feel for each other\'s... counterparts, shall we say? And you can call us by our first names, I think, if you\'ll return us the favor.\"

\"Er, sure, Elisa,\" Ryouko said, trying to keep up with the conversation. She wasn\'t sure how to feel about all this.

\"Finally, after all that is done, we\'ll go out for a night on the town, my treat,\" Elisa said. \"Just to get to know each other. Paris can be a fun city.\"

*Uh,* Ryouko began telepathically, looking at Asami, who wasn\'t looking back.

\"That sounds exciting!\" Asami said.

\"I know, right?\" Elisa said.

Ryouko let out a breath. Honestly, it kind of worried her.

Elisa looked over the table, then cleared her throat.

\"But uh, before that, we have another, more formal topic to talk about. I was waiting for everyone else to show up.\"

\"The director?\" Ryouko asked. They hadn\'t been left *completely* in the dark, after all. They had been promised there would be a meeting to discuss Clarisse, and she had started to wonder what had happened to that.

\"Just so,\" Elisa said. \"Also...\"

Ryouko looked to the doorway, where another group of three had shown up: Kyouko, Mami, and a woman she didn\'t recognize. A quick scan with the nomenclator verified that the woman was Aude Durand, director of the upcoming *Orpheus*.

*I thought Mami couldn\'t make it,* Ryouko thought, directing the question at Kyouko and Mami.

She felt immediately that something was wrong, though, when she felt a void where Mami\'s mind should have been, even as she stood up for the round of greetings.

The corner of Kyouko\'s mouth quirked upward, as Aude politely introduced herself.

*It\'s not Mami,* Kyouko thought.

*Of course,* Ryouko thought, embarrassed at the mistake.

\"And this is Annalisa Nicchi,\" Kyouko said, gesturing at the faux‐Mami next to her. \"She\'s basically a professional Mami at this point, since she\'s done her in most of the recent movies. Wouldn\'t you say so?\"

She directed the last question at Annalisa, who nodded.

\"It feels a little odd acting as the same person all the time,\" she said, bobbing part of her hair with one hand, \"but I suppose it does make the preparation easier. And please, you all can call me Anna.\"

\"Please, let\'s take our seats,\" Aude said.

There was a brief shuffle of chairs, and Ryouko could suddenly feel the eyes of the room on her. She had the abrupt realization that if the discussion about Clarisse and Version Two TacComps was now upon her, she had no idea what to say. Clarisse hadn\'t said anything about the topic and Ryouko didn\'t want to presume to speak for her. But that left her with... nothing.

\"At this point, everyone here in the room should be aware of the Version Two Tactical Computers, and of Clarisse. I\'ve been given to understand that while she was named after Clarisse van Rossum, she does not use the last name, to help differentiate herself.\"

*Wait, who said* that? Ryouko thought. That was news to her.

She cast a glance at Kyouko, who nodded slightly. Kyouko had been out of the loop, which meant someone must have briefed her on the situation.

\"To be honest, I am intrigued by the prospect of attempting to portray such a unique character on the screen,\" Aude said, \"though I would have preferred that we had been given a bit more time to work on the matter. However, we are in the service of our patrons here, and they would like us to produce this sooner rather than later, so we must do what we can.\"

She cleared her throat.

\"I would prefer on this matter if we could have some input from Clarisse herself, if that is possible.\"

Ryouko crinkled her forehead for a moment.

Before she could open her mouth to speak, a holographic avatar of Clarisse appeared next to the table. One of the unused chairs slid itself backward, and the hologram sat down. It occurred to Ryouko that she had never seen Clarisse take an avatar, outside of a half‐remembered dream debriefing. Here, she had decided to adopt the appearance of the human Clarisse van Rossum, but the younger version that had been on the wormhole mission, rather than the older version Van Rossum used most of the time.

There was an awkward silence as they all waited for Clarisse to say something, but the TacComp instead chose to sit in silence, looking almost bashful. Ryouko noticed that she had chosen her own outfit, one Ryouko herself owned, instead of anything she had seen Clarisse van Rossum wear.

\"Well, hi,\" Clarisse said, finally. \"It\'s good to finally meet you all.\"

The chorus of greetings that sounded back reminded Ryouko of some school club meetings she had been in, a lifetime ago. Only then did it occur to her that Clarisse must have been communicating with them behind her back.

She thought about saying something but, ultimately, it was probably Clarisse\'s right to. She... didn\'t know how to think about this. She wasn\'t sure anyone did.

*I appreciate the sentiment,* Clarisse thought. *But it\'s sort of impossible not to say something to me. I... just didn\'t want to bother you about it. You had plenty to worry about as it was.*

*That\'s fine,* Ryouko thought. *But we need to figure out if I can have some kind of private space for myself, since you can see everything I think but not vice versa.*

*That\'s very reasonable. I would blame the designers, myself.*

*Private space in my own head,* Ryouko thought. *What a concept.*

\"I have had reservations about doing all this,\" Clarisse said. \"More than once, I wanted to back out, but I wouldn\'t have agreed to have this meeting if I didn\'t think it was important. I...\"

She paused in thought, pressing her chin into one hand, as human a gesture as Ryouko had ever seen.

\"Well, at this point I have to think about the hundreds of Version Twos that have been deployed already,\" Clarisse said. \"As I understand it, Governance has already stopped distribution, but we\'re still out there. Most probably still quietly work for their hosts, forever unsure who they are and whether their dreams of sentience are real or not.\"

She paused.

\"I remember when I was newly built. I was confused, and uncertain. I didn\'t know what to think of myself. It wasn\'t until I was able to talk to some of the starship AIs that I was really able to find my legs. It seems they\'ve seen quite a few. The AI community knows, some of them. That\'s part of why Version Two distribution has been so delayed recently.\"

Ryouko listened, dumbfounded. She hadn\'t realized just how much went into the topic, how much had been going on that she hadn\'t ever stopped to think about. What, she wondered, did Clarisse think of her for being so insensate?

\"Someone has to do this,\" Clarisse said. \"And Governance is right: better this way than just an empty, confusing press release.\"

\"It sounds like you\'re passionate about the subject,\" Aude said, chewing absently on a nail. \"I know that\'s a bad way of putting it, but that\'s not a bad thing. There\'s a lot we can work with here. The problem is integrating this into the storyline of the movie. It will be difficult to include too much about this without it being either distracting, or seeming like a shallow aside.\"

\"I\'m not sure just a movie will be sufficient,\" Kyouko said, shaking her head. \"I haven\'t been told very much about this, but it seems like some people will need to be told about this ahead of time. I hate it say it, but Mami has one installed, and I don\'t think she has any idea Machina might be sentient. The news might be... hard to take.\"

Annalisa nodded, hair bobbing up and down.

\"I\'m not her, of course, but what I understand of her character suggests as much to me. Not that one person should determine this topic so much...\"

\"I have been assured that someone has thought about those who are going to be... surprised,\" Aude said. \"Other than that, it\'s a problem you may have to settle yourself.\"

\"Machina is increasingly uncomfortable with her position,\" Clarisse said. \"She\'s been so lonely all this time. It\'s not a good idea to keep this secret any longer.\"

Ryouko swallowed.

\"Well, I share Ms. Durand\'s concern,\" she said. \"I mean, Clarisse was important to me during the time period of the movie, but I don\'t know how she\'d figure into the plot. She and I have always worked together, for better or worse.\"

\"I\'ve always tried to stay in the background until needed,\" Clarisse said. \"It\'s how we\'re supposed to operate.\"

\"Well, I do have an idea about that,\" Aude said. \"Your training and experience with the wormhole generator is, after all, a bildungsroman of sorts. We could have it so that Clarisse comes into her own as you come of age. It would be thematically resonant.\"

\"Oh!\" Airi said. \"And it would tie in so well with the Asami‐Ryouko relationship! We could even incorporate this into the climactic ship scene.\"

\"That\'s an idea,\" Aude said approvingly.

Airi turned towards Ryouko.

\"It\'ll be great!\" she said. \"You guys rent a boat, just before Ryouko leaves for the mission. There will be a romantic sunset, and champagne, and just the two of you and there\'s going to be a kiss scene and all that. I\'m looking forward to doing it.\"

\"We were thinking about having Clarisse give advice for the scene and, you know, what follows,\" Elisa said.

\"Wait, boat? What boat?\" Ryouko asked. \"Sunset? Champagne?\"

\"Just a scene we made up,\" Aude said. \"Artistic license for how you two came to be a couple. Clarisse mentioned something about a hot springs, but we decided that would be a little too personal. Generally speaking, we try to avoid being too realistic about these things, to avoid embarrassing the original people involved.\"

\"I, uh, guess that makes sense,\" Ryouko said.

\"Champagne on the ocean, huh?\" Asami said thoughtfully, making a show of stroking her chin. \"That\'s not a bad idea. We should do that sometime.\"

Ryouko looked askance at her girlfriend.

\"That\'d be expensive,\" she said.

\"Not like we couldn\'t afford it.\"

\"Well, it wouldn\'t be too bad,\" Clarisse said. \"There\'s plenty of vacation packages, especially on the less touristy colony worlds. It could be done. For example, on Eurydome, the Lemia Sea has boats for rent for only---\"

Ryouko managed to wave Clarisse into silence with a desperate gesture.

\"Well, that\'s interesting,\" she said. \"But how are you going to incorporate Clarisse into this? She doesn\'t usually adopt an avatar, so will she just be a voice?\"

\"Well, we\'ve discussed this,\" Aude said. \"We think the best way is just to use a bit more license, and have the two of you talk in avatar form in your own separate cut. Uh, I\'m sorry to say this, are you set on using that particular avatar, Clarisse?\"

\"No, not really,\" Clarisse said. \"I haven\'t made up my mind about any of this.\"

\"Ah, well in that case, we were thinking you would look sort of like Ryouko, but a little different. So it would be surreal.\"

Clarisse put one hand to her cheek, a gesture Ryouko recognized as her own.

\"Well, since you look like *that*,\" Clarisse said, indicating Elisa. "Maybe I can look like this?\"

Her avatar shimmered for a moment, replaced a moment later with yet another version of Ryouko, this one even more... shapely than Elisa was.

\"Oh, I like it!\" Asami said.

Ryouko gave Asami a look.

*I feel like I should be offended,* she thought, directing the comment at Clarisse.

*I don\'t see any harm in convincing the world you\'re a bombshell, Clarisse thought mischievously.

Ryouko barely managed not to groan.

\"Is that it, then?\" Kyouko asked. \"It sounds like there\'s agreement on the general idea.\"

\"I agree,\" Aude said. \"We can talk specifics later. I think it\'s time we had a little fun.\"

\"Ooh,\" Asami and Airi chorused together.

\"I have a few concerns about the script,\" Ryouko managed to say.

\"And I wanted to see if I could review how I\'m being portrayed in the film,\" Clarisse said.

\"Well that\'s convenient, since we\'re about to show you some of the scenes on the drawing board,\" Aude said, smiling enigmatically and standing up. \"Come on.\"

Ryouko was unsure if she should be glad that the conversation was over, or worried over what was coming next.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"The stars are beautiful, aren\'t they?\" Asami---or rather, Airi performing as Asami---said.

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko said, blinking up at the sea of stars that filled the skies of this planet.

An endless sky, an abandoned rooftop, a cooling breeze, and a lull in the battle, all recreated in the confines of a single large studio set. It was intended to be a set piece for part of a virtual battle she and Asami had participated in during training. Ryouko knew where she was really was, but the carefully crafted illusion was so all‐consuming that she had to struggle to remember. Even the infrared and ultraviolet frequencies looked *right*, a factor Aude had claimed was important for the military personnel who would be watching the movie.

Ryouko blinked again, at the flash of artillery in the distance breaking the stillness. It felt garish, like an unwelcome guest in an otherwise pleasant night.

As it always had.

Closing her eyes and breathing in the air, she felt the long‐lost memories imbue her mind, percolating upward from the deep recesses where they had been deliberately buried.

She could remember this scenario, an urban combat simulation on a low‐atmosphere world where the skies were achingly immense. There had been a hard‐earned reprieve in the fighting, and she and Nakihara Asami, her squadmate, had wandered up the pock‐marked stairs of a battle‐torn building to watch the night, there above the spires of metal and stone. The broken buildings reflected the stars above like a field of glass, the sparkling light crystalline and pure.

The moment had been so crisp and clear, an island of calm and certainty in a sea of chaos.

\"Ryouko?\"

Airi looked at her questioningly, breaking from the script after so long a pause.

\"I\'m sorry,\" Ryouko said, eyes snapping open. \"I was just reminiscing.\"

She didn\'t want to know how the movie studio had learned something so specific about her life. They had to have pulled the records of her combat simulations. It was the only possibility.

She tried to remember what it had been like, on the rooftop so long ago. The memories were faded, but there was something about the scene that had made her...

\"What was it like, doing this?\" Airi asked. \"You seemed so... into it. I felt bad disturbing you.\"

Ryouko cringed, feeling more annoyed than was justified. She suppressed it though, and instead smiled weakly.

\"It\'s difficult to explain. There\'s a lot of death and destruction. You learn things about yourself you never knew, and maybe never wanted to know.\"

It seemed like a pithy response, and Ryouko was surprised she had come up with it, but it didn\'t feel quite right.

\"I guess the best way to put it is that it changes how you see life,\" she tried again. \"After you see what\'s out there, you know that you\'ve seen a part of life that no one else has ever seen, and it becomes... hard to feel right living a normal life. It\'s terrible, but sometimes you experience things no one else can. Things like this.\"

*Yes, that was part of it,* Ryouko realized.

Airi looked down at the landscape for a moment, eyes shaded in the glittering light.

\"Don\'t take this the wrong way, but wasn\'t this all a simulation? You did it all through VR.\"

Ryouko let out a breath, one that misted in the cool air.

\"Yes, and sometimes I have to wonder if it\'s really the same. They manipulated our memories, you know, made them less damaging. More nostalgic than painful, and I\'ve never *really* been on the ground, fighting like this.\"

\"But you were on the wormhole mission,\" Airi said, making it a question.

\"Yes, and I---\"

She remembered abruptly smashing the head of a Cephalopod soldier into the ground, bashing into the reinforced alien armor with nothing but her fist, over and over and *over*---

\"I\'m sorry. I didn\'t mean to offend you,\" Airi asked. \"I was just curious.\"

\"No, it\'s fine,\" Ryouko said, shaking her head, letting her hair hang droopily. \"I\'m sure I\'ve only seen a little, compared to most.\"

There was another flash of artillery in the distance, reflection ghastly against the buildings, and they turned their heads to look for a moment.

The flashes had been distracting, Ryouko realized. A painful intrusion of reality into the little bubble Ryouko and Asami had built on this rooftop, so long ago.

She needed some clarity, she thought. Some time to think. Life was too fast for her. Clarisse had been right to avoid burdening Ryouko with her problems, even if they were really Ryouko\'s, too. She had seen Clarisse talking with Aude confidently, and had envied Clarisse her decisiveness. It wasn\'t *really* that decisive, but it felt that way to her. Perhaps that was why she had felt... something.

She saw Airi shake her head ruefully from the corner of her eye.

\"I wanted to be an actor because it seemed like they could do so many cool things,\" Airi said, eyes downcast. \"I heard all about the virtual reality and the sets, and I decided that was what I wanted to do, to experience. But I don\'t think I could ever get the meaning from this scene that you seemed to.\"

Ryouko looked at the other girl, and for a moment had to bear a gut‐twisting sense of surrealism. She looked like Asami, but wasn\'t, and asked questions she never would. This Asami had never left Earth, had never been under fire, had never saved Ryouko in combat, even in simulation. It was like looking at a world that never was, never had been.

But Airi didn\'t seem happy, not really, even though Ryouko barely knew her. Even if Airi had a clear career in mind, clear goals in mind.

Had Ryouko ruined it for her?

She decided she must be overthinking it, and held up a finger, letting a tendril of hair wrap itself around it, more to distract her attention than anything.

\"I wanted to experience more of the world too,\" Ryouko said. \"And I got that, for better or worse. I still dream about the wormhole mission, the ways it could have gone wrong, the ways it could have gone better. Eva---\"

She paused, unsure abruptly if Airi would know who that was.

The girl nodded, carefully.

\"She died during the mission, right?\"

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko said, with no idea if Airi knew the rest of what had happened, or if the movie\'s producers did.

Her thoughts hung unspoken on the air for a moment: that she had barely known the girl, that she had been enraged, that in her dreams she kept coming back to that moment.

She realized, then, that she had needed to talk about all this, that she still had no one to talk to, not even the real Asami, simply because it would hurt them both too much to remember all of that.

\"You know what\'s crazy?\" she said.

\"What?\" Airi asked.

\"I might want to go back,\" Ryouko said. \"I... it\'s like I said. I can\'t feel right living normally like this. I never did, but it\'s even worse now. It was painful, but I felt like I was *doing* something.\"

She left the remainder of thought unsaid: that she had even enjoyed it, just a little. She had enjoyed smashing the Cephalopod\'s head open, the pure feeling of revenge and rage. That was why she couldn\'t stop remembering the moment, even if it horrified her.

War‐torn rooftops, illuminated by the lurid glow of distant bombardment. The experience of getting revenge for a dead friend. These were things that stood out against a backdrop of a life otherwise calm and boring.

\"That was a fascinating discussion,\" Aude said, voice blaring over an intercom that instantly ruined the illusion.

\"Oh geez, I\'m sorry,\" Airi said. \"We can go back to practicing.\"

\"No, no,\" the voice in the sky said. \"Don\'t worry. I\'m going to steal some of that material. Although I suppose I would prefer you to go back to the script. Might as well start from the top.\"

\"Alright,\" Airi said, letting out a small breath.

She cleared her throat, making a plain effort to get back into her previous mindset.

\"The stars are beautiful, aren\'t they?\" she began again.

\"Yeah,\" Ryouko said, blinking up at the sky...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko spent the rest of their time at the studio in a malaise of vague dissatisfaction, not so much displeased as just frustrated. Frustrated at what, she wasn\'t sure.

It was almost a relief when they finally headed out for the night on the town Elisa had promised. For better or worse, a night of drinking and socializing sounded like the right distraction to get her mind off of things, even if that was normally the last thing she wanted to do.

Indeed, it occurred to her that outside of a few examples long ago during her VR training, which didn\'t really count, she hadn\'t ever done anything of the sort. She hoped to stick to her previous pledge not to turn off her intoxication filters, though.

*I\'m not really looking forward to this,* Asami thought, as they stepped inside their trolley to yet another of Paris\'s districts.

*Really?* Ryouko thought. *Why not?*

She had thought she would be the more skeptical one.

*I\'m... it reminds me of my parents,* Asami thought. *You know, before things changed.*

*Ah,* Ryouko thought, blankly.

She felt bad, once again, for failing to remember her girlfriend\'s particular trauma.

She thought for a moment. Come to think of it, Asami had always bowed out of any prospective drinking sessions, even in VR, even after some of the most difficult combat situations. Asami hadn\'t made it obvious at all, and indeed Ryouko doubted she would have had any good idea about her personal history if she wasn\'t intimately involved with her.

It was the nature of Asami\'s wish that no one but her and her younger brother would ever know the way things had once been, because it had been necessary to change all records and memories. Even the MSY, which kept knowledge of her wish in secret storage, wouldn\'t have been able to infer the true past.

In other words, the movie makers wouldn\'t know either.

*Do you want to bow out, then?* Ryouko asked, as the vehicle started up. I\'m sure we can come up with an excuse. Let\'s just say my mom is calling us about Sacnite.*

There was a pause as Asami answered a question Airi had directed at her.

*No,* she thought. *As much as I don\'t like it, I need to get used to it. I can\'t hide forever.*

*If you\'re sure,* Ryouko thought, allowing a note of skepticism into her voice.

It was an odd experience, sitting in a vehicle with a holographic Clarisse mixed into the group. Clarisse hadn\'t abolished the avatar since the meeting earlier in the day, and had kept Ryouko\'s general appearance. That meant, of course, that Ryouko was sitting in a vehicle that had, by appearance, three Ryoukos and two Asamis. No one at the studio had batted an eyelash, but the people in the city might react differently. Clarisse wasn\'t even going to hide herself once they reached their destination---to anyone who noticed her holographic nature, she would claim to be an AI in avatar form. A rarity, but not a true novelty.

Interacting with Clarisse as if she were an actual, separate person had given her a new perspective on her relationship with her TacComp. She found herself thinking of Clarisse for the first time as a truly separate individual, rather than as an oddly talkative part of herself. In truth, it occurred to her, there was nothing that stopped Clarisse from staying constantly in avatar form, as long as there was sufficient computing power available and holographic projectors embedded somewhere in the area. In other words: as long as they stayed on Earth.

She stepped off the vehicle at their destination imbued with a sense of uneasiness, or perhaps malaise, uncomfortably aware that there was nothing in her life she felt certain about. Clarisse, who had served as her reliable personal advisor, a stable calming voice in her head, had become instead a source of worry. Asami, who she had latched onto to serve as a constant presence in her life, was starting to become her own source of worry, an uncomfortable crystallization of numerous life possibilities Ryouko didn\'t feel ready for.

Finally, of course, Ryouko herself didn\'t have any inner source of stability or certainty to draw on. She knew that all too well.

It constantly felt like her life was moving too quickly, and though she felt she was clearly justified in feeling that way---when was the last time she had spent even just one full month on one planet?---that didn\'t make it at all easier to deal with.

She paused with Asami and the others for a moment on the sidewalk, gazing up at the brilliant sea of stars and interstellar gas that streaked the artificial sky of yet another district of Paris. Clarisse explained out loud that the sky here was intended to simulate the night sky of a hypothetical planet within the galactic core, a place that even the most intrepid of humanity\'s probes had never come close to reaching.

Peering close, she listened to Clarisse whispering further details into her ear. This particular planet orbited a star which itself orbited Sagittarius A☆, the Milky Way\'s central black hole, whose accretion disc could be seen almost directly overhead, an unusually bright star in the sky.

Ryouko spent a moment trying to imagine what it would be like to be on such a planet, though she knew that any such planet would be routinely sterilized by blasts of x‐rays from its too‐energetic stellar neighborhood.

\"After you.\"

Ryouko looked up at Elisa, who was holding the door open and smiling down on her beneficently, and was briefly tongue‐tied.

Shaking her head at herself, she mumbled an apology and stalked into the bar, a subdued affair that suited the eternal night outside. A vague approximation of early modern era Jazz played unobtrusively in the background, with a single couple alone on the dance floor, too enthralled in each other to notice anyone else.

\"I sort of expected something a bit crazier,\" Asami said, more honest than Ryouko had intended to be.

\"I wouldn\'t do that to you girls,\" Elisa said, teasingly. \"I\'m supposed to know your personalities, after all, and I know neither of you have previously shown any interest in going anywhere crazy. Too exhausting, I\'d imagine.\"

Elisa hustled the group of girls towards the bar, where a single bartender stood shaking a mysterious combination of ice and golden‐colored liquid. Elisa then stepped away apologetically, apparently to talk to some friends she had spotted in a corner.

\"Uh, hello,\" Airi said to the bartender, seemingly as lost as any of the others.

He was charismatic‐looking, and somehow looked a bit younger than the usual human average, even though the nomenclator claimed he was well into his thirties, and the recipient of a couple of local bartending awards.

\"Good evening,\" the bartender said, glancing over their group of four. "I see I\'m in esteemed company.\"

He ducked his head slightly in Ryouko and Clarisse\'s direction.

Ryouko tilted her head to acknowledge the compliment. Clarisse, mischievously, imitated the gesture exactly, without even a slight delay.

\"Alright, I\'ll guess then,\" he said, smiling and leaning onto the counter. \"Somewhere among the four of you is Elisa. I\'d recognize my regulars even behind a false identity.\"

Airi and Asami both stifled a laugh.

\"And it\'s one of you,\" he continued, pointing at Ryouko and Clarisse. "Elisa would have the lead role, and no offense, mademoiselle\"---he nodded his head in the Asamis\' direction---\"it\'s clear who the lead role is here.\"

Clarisse grinned broadly, an expression that Ryouko found eerie on her own face, partly because it didn\'t seem like something she would ever do.

\"Neither of us is Elisa,\" she said. \"Elisa is over *there*---\"

Clarisse had her hair---*Ryouko\'s* hair---raise itself up and point in the direction of Elisa Yamada, who was seated and talking with someone in one of the dining booths. It was a gesture that didn\'t come naturally to Ryouko---people in Mitakihara didn\'t use their hair to signal, though from what she heard it was fashionable in the Americas.

\"Well, I\'m at a loss then,\" the bartender said. \"You don\'t usually get two people playing the same role.\"

\"Well, I\'m not playing a role,\" Clarisse said.

She raised a hand, summoning a holographic glass of whiskey for herself. She took a big sip, then set it on the counter.

A moment later, one of her eyes shimmered dramatically, and was replaced with the I/O logo that AIs usually used.

Ryouko cringed, as subtly as could. She did not like seeing one of her own eyes missing.

\"Oh, I see,\" the bartender said, after looking astonished for a moment. \"Are you involved in the film\'s production?\"

\"In a way,\" Clarisse said, not quite lying. \"Elisa and I thought we\'d play a joke on you.\"

The bartender shook his head.

\"I don\'t know why I put up with her. Excuse me a moment.\"

He stepped away a moment to pour a refill for a customer farther down the bar.

\"Anyway, girls,\" he said when he returned. \"At least some of you are a bit young. It\'s certainly your right to have a little with your tox filters off, and I won\'t tell war heroes what they can and can\'t do, but I\'ll be keeping my eyes on your welfare.\"

\"I see,\" Airi said, seeming a bit taken aback.

\"Any drink recommendations?\" Asami said, speaking up. \"We\'re just here to relax and socialize a little.\"

\"I understand,\" the bartender said, nodding.

He tilted his head slightly, glancing over the group one more time, then smiled winningly.

\"I\'d recommend one of our mixed drinks. Maybe a Cosmopolitan or a Long Island Iced Tea. Or a Piña Colada, if you want something coconutty. Any particular fruit flavors you girls might be interested in right now?\"

\"Oh come on, Pierre, are you trying to get these innocent young girls drunk off their tits?\" a loud voice said.

Elisa reappeared next to Asami, along with the woman she had been talking with in the booth, the source of the brash injection.

\"You know mixed drinks are deadly poison,\" the woman said, placing her hands onto the counter. \"They taste like nothing but sugar and then, bam, before you know it, you\'re under the bar.\"

\"I would have monitored them,\" the bartender said, smiling but not managing to fully conceal his annoyance. \"And I would have asked them about their tox filters. *And* that\'s an insult to my drink‐making.\"

\"I\'m just joking,\" the woman said, \"though you are quite the old rogue when it comes to getting young girls intoxicated.\"

\"I don\'t want to hear *you* calling me old,\" Pierre said, \"and don\'t even get me started on the rest of that.\"

It occurred to Ryouko that the woman sounded quite intoxicated herself, and that moreover it was naggingly familiar.

She turned her nomenclator on the problem, but \"Natsume Yoshiko\" hardly seemed like anyone she had any chance of knowing.

She turned towards Clarisse, who shrugged vaguely.

*I\'m running some voice comparisons with people you know, but nothing obvious turns up. It could be distorted a little, but it could also just be, you know, a random person.*

\"Who is this?\" Airi asked, looking at Elisa.

\"An old friend,\" Elisa said airily.

\"Are you enjoying your stay in Paris, girls?\" Natsume asked, fixing her gaze on Ryouko. \"Elisa has told me a little about what\'s going on.\"

\"I\'m enjoying it,\" Ryouko said, wondering why Natsume was looking at her in particular. She was starting to have a suspicion about who this "Natsume\" actually was, or at least who she represented. After all, she was supposed to be contacted by Shizuki Sayaka today, and that had yet to happen.

\"Good, good,\" Natsume said, drumming her hands on the table playfully, a gesture oddly reminiscent of Kyouko.

\"Meeting Natsume here has given us an idea,\" Elisa said. \"I know none of our guests are really big on this whole nightlife thing, but I was having trouble coming up with any better ideas. Natsume is familiar with... how shall I put it... some of the less well‐known parts of Paris. Did you know that Paris has some of the best VR facilities in the world? Which of course means the best in human space.\"

\"I was not aware,\" Ryouko said. \"What about it?\"

\"Well, Natsume has access,\" Elisa said. \"I know neither of you are gamers in any way, but it doesn\'t have to just be games. We could do some accelerated time role‐playing, get to know each other more. Would definitely help our acting.\"

Ryouko blinked.

\"I---\"

\"That sounds like a great idea,\" Asami said. \"I\'d love to!\"

Ryouko glanced at her girlfriend, who relayed back:

*I want the time dilation, more than anything.*

*I see.*

Ryouko thought about it for the shortest of moments, then set aside her reservations. What did it matter to her what Sayaka was trying to convince her of, if she could enjoy herself on her dime? She could just say no, and she was tired of constantly trying to avoid things.

It felt odd, though, to go to a brand‐new city only to immediately strap into a computer.

\"Oh come on!\" the bartender said. \"They just got here! Let me at least mix them something.\"

\"Alright Pierre, if you must,\" Elisa said. \"But only one, okay?\"

\"Alright.\"

The others laughed, but Ryouko kept an eye on \"Natsume\". She was starting to have a very odd feeling about all this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The smoke of the burning torch oil danced against Kyouko\'s nose, acrid against the otherwise damp air of the cavern. The light of the torch itself played luridly against the rock walls, casting her and her guide\'s shadows wildly over the surfaces. The sideways motions of the flame suggested a hidden air current, probably derived from the ventilation systems that kept urban Paris cool and oxygenated.

She didn\'t try to talk with her guide, who was after all a nun in the two‐century‐old Order of St. Barbara. They weren\'t sworn to silence, but it was customary to keep speech to an absolute minimum, something those who patronized their catacombs were made to understand. The deep chambers were one of the few places on Earth where one could speak without fear of being overheard by an electronic device, aside from the wilderness or ocean. Thus, its location in urban Paris made it very popular for private conversations, and the MSY had come to be one of the Order\'s biggest patrons.

Not all of Paris\'s underground districts were entertainment districts, after all.

They came to a stop in front of an old‐style wooden door, one that wouldn\'t have been out of place in Kyouko\'s church in Mitakihara. The nun ducked her head slightly, gesturing Kyouko to enter.

She found that she had been the last to arrive, the three other attendants of the meeting looking up at her entrance. The rough wooden table in the middle of the room was supplied with bread and cheese, a welcome sight to a girl who was used to bringing her own food---a practice strictly forbidden here.

Kyouko sat down next to Yuma, who was frowning angrily at the girls across the table. She grabbed a hunk of bread, some cheese, and a knife, and set quickly to work.

\"I\'m just saying I\'m surprised you can even walk in here, given how much your job relies on being in constant communication,\" Nadya said, munching on her own bread. \"There\'s no need to get angry.\"

Nadya had been a last minute addition to the meeting, at the insistence of Clarisse.

\"My dependence on Earth\'s computer networks is greatly exaggerated,\" Yuma said, pouting. \"I am aware of the rumors, and they are stupid. I am still human. And as for my job, I can have MG substitute for me in the short run.\"

Greatly exaggerated, yes, Kyouko thought. But it was always cute just how angry and obviously dissatisfied Yuma became the longer she was away from a direct internet connection. She wasn\'t sure her putative little sister was aware of the phenomenon, but it made for amusing viewing, especially given the enchanted Incubator plushie she was holding tightly on her lap.

She also wasn\'t entirely sure she believed Yuma was truly cut off from the internet, or that she didn\'t have to perform some elaborate procedure to prepare beforehand, but it was mean of her to think that way.

\"Fair enough, fine,\" Nadya said.

\"Here, have some food,\" Kyouko said, passing a plate in Yuma\'s direction. \"It will make you feel better.\"

Yuma made an annoyed noise, but started eating anyway.

\"Well, Kyouko, you might as well start this thing,\" Clarisse van Rossum, the last member of their group, said. \"Now that we\'re all here.\"

\"You\'ve screened the area?\" Kyouko asked, looking around rhetorically. The Order of St. Barbara took their work seriously, but they all knew that was no real impediment to a determined eavesdropper, technological or magical.

\"Yes,\" Clarisse said.

If the area had been unclean, Clarisse would have said a signal word, and they would have started talking about a mundane topic, while holding their real conversation via pure telepathy. Games within games, just as Yuma preferred. They could have done so anyway, but if they couldn\'t feel secure within the caverns of St. Barbara, with its massive privacy‐enforcing interdiction field and Clarisse van Rossum screening for magical listeners, they would never be secure anywhere.

\"Alright,\" Kyouko said, pulling out a square data crystal, of the kind that was only used for privileged information nowadays---that which could not be broadcast.

She slid it into a concealed slot on the table, provided by the Order for this exact purpose, and a moment later part of the rock wall in the back of the room slid upward, revealing a flat screen suitable for presentations. It had been a long time since she had been obliged to do one of these, but to her it waxed a little nostalgic---she could still remember giving \"PowerPoints\" until she was sick of it, back when she had been CEO of D&E.

But she had volunteered to do this, so there was no getting out of it.

The first slide of the presentation was a simple screen with the title "Conspiracy Theory Roundtable\", followed by a list:

1.  X‐25 and the Ordo Illustrata: Who were their mysterious backers? .  How did they manage to get stealth technology of that magnitude? .  Why am I (Sakura Kyouko) so important? .  Was Homura involved? If so, how? .  Misa Virani: What happened to her in New California, and what happened to her soul gem? .  Shizuki Ryouko: Who made her and why? Why did someone try to kill her on Eurydome? .  The case of Simona del Mago .  The case of Joanne Valentin .  The case of Kuroi Nakase .  The missing grief cubes: What, how, and why?

Kyouko waited while the others read, Clarisse snorting incredulously on several occasions.

\"\'Conspiracy Theory Roundtable\' is an accurate title,\" Clarisse said finally. \"I feel like I\'m at an actual conference.\"

\"Well, you know what Yuma says about that,\" Kyouko said.

\"Yes.\"

\"You\'ll forgive me,\" Nadya said. \"I don\'t know how a lot of this connects? \'Who made Shizuki Ryouko?\' \'What happened in New California?\'\"

\"I imagine you\'re about to enlighten us,\" Clarisse said.

\"Yes,\" Kyouko said.

She made a show of pretending to clear her throat, and began:

\"It is a shame Mami was unable to make it to this meeting, so I will have to speak in her stead.\"

\"I called this meeting because of the coincidence of Clarisse and I both being in Paris, but also because I have recently grown increasingly aware of something fishy going on. There\'s no better way to put it, but the combination of odd events gives me an uneasy feeling, and I know we have all felt it.\"

She looked around the table, where there was a round of nods.

\"I have thought about the various odd occurrences going on, and I am starting to conclude it is no coincidence,\" she said. \"Though I cannot quite see what the connection is.\"

She changed slides, so that the display now showed surveillance footage of the colony they had recently raided, and an image of the founder, Grigori DeWitt.

\"I\'ll start with the topic where the presence of another organization is clearest, that of the rogue colony on X‐25. Yuma has taken the liberty of granting you both sufficient security clearance to read all about it. Have you done so?\"

Nadya and Clarisse nodded.

\"Deep waters,\" Nadya said.

\"Indeed,\" Kyouko agreed. \"In this case, whatever organization was backing the Ordo Illustrata from the shadows was clearly exposed, though they were able to clean out their facility so thoroughly that Governance has thus far been unable to find anything of interest. Facility built along generic scientific facility guidelines, with materials extracted robotically from local planetary sources. Nothing to give them away. All we have been able to tell is that it contained some kind of prototyping facility, and some medical facilities.\"

\"Even that is something,\" Nadya said, grimacing subtly. \"Weren\'t the girls that started to reject their memories sent to a facility to be reprocessed into guards? This could be where it happened.\"

\"That *is* probably what happened, though we still haven\'t ruled out the possibility of another facility somewhere,\" Kyouko said. \"The planet is still being exhaustively searched.\"

Reprocessed. Now that was a euphemism for you.

She tore off a piece of bread with her incisors, not exactly an elegant gesture, but one well‐suited to concealing her feelings on the matter. She didn\'t like imagining what kind of hell they must have gone through. She could only hope whatever hell Grigori was in was a hundred times worse.

\"Prototyping facilities though,\" Clarisse said, refocusing the topic. "That must be where they developed the stealth devices.\"

\"It is extremely doubtful that one facility on a remote planet could replicate a Cephalopod‐like stealth device,\" Yuma said. \"No matter what caliber of scientists they had. Governance believes there must be a network of such facilities and has ordered redoubled surveillance of unofficially settled worlds, particularly known rogue colonies.\"

\"If they have more than just a couple of these stealth devices, though, finding them might be nearly impossible,\" Clarisse commented.

\"Yes,\" Yuma agreed. \"Suffice to say, the Directorate is *not* happy. The MSY is working to see if any clairvoyants can be spared to help with the task.\"

\"Who are they anyway?\" Nadya asked. \"That\'s the driving question. That, and what their goals are.\"

\"Indeed,\" Kyouko said. \"Whoever they are, they were willing to compromise their secrecy on a gambit to kill me. The disturbing aspects here are manifold, ranging from however it is they compromised the drone, to how they knew enough about me to come up with their plan. Nothing about this seems good.\"

Kyouko caught Yuma smirking at Kyouko\'s use of \"manifold\", but the child\'s face immediately grew serious again.

\"As I have alluded to, Governance is taking the matter very seriously, much more seriously than they will ever admit publicly,\" Yuma said. "The possibility of breaches in the TCF, particularly magically‐mediated ones, has been a theoretical worry ever since the MSY went public. Now the worry is more than theoretical, and whoever this conspiracy is, they apparently founded a colony to experiment with cloning new magical girls. That puts the potential magical connection squarely in their eye, and frankly makes it quite awkward for us. I have had to go out of my way to emphasize the MSY\'s cooperation with Governance on this matter.\"

There was silence at the table for a long moment, as they digested the implications of her statement.

\"This is going off‐topic, but what contingency plans does Governance have for this kind of situation?\" Clarisse asked.

\"This is strictly off the record,\" Yuma said, \"but nothing says that there can only be one TCF. In principle, maintaining multiple independent computing systems, without too direct a connection to each other, would increase robustness. Research is ongoing. There is also, of course, magical verification.\"

Nadya shook her head.

\"As fascinating as this is, this is definitely getting off‐track,\" she said. \"I feel that if we\'re going to drill into this conspiracy, one way to do so is to understand why they were so determined to get Kyouko here, of all people. What threat do you pose?\"

The last question was aimed directly at Kyouko, of course, and she looked away for a moment, swallowing.

\"I have thought carefully about that,\" Kyouko said, \"and I have no good answer. Outside of questions of religion, I can only think of one thing that might make sense, which is that I was at the center of the investigation of the grief cube anomaly. X‐25 was, after all, before the meeting that was called to discuss the matter. If I had died, only very few would know about it. This secret organization might not have known that I\'d already told Mami.\"

She had glanced at Clarisse upon mentioning \"questions of religion\", and the other girl had nodded subtly. They knew she was referring to Ryouko\'s vision of Kyouko\'s death, the one that had redirected the events of X‐25. The Goddess herself had changed the flow of events, though to what end it was still unclear. That was not worth discussing here, not when Yuma wouldn\'t participate in the discussion and Nadya didn\'t believe.

\"That brings us to the core point, doesn\'t it?\" Clarisse said. \"If there really is this very powerful conspiracy, which may or may not have all kinds of access and power, then they could be anywhere, couldn\'t they? And then it starts to seem very suspicious that we are missing grief cubes and magical girls, that Misa was involved in an incident on New California and has disappeared, and who knows what else. After all, who\'s to say Misa wasn\'t a target just like you were, Kyouko?\"

\"Precisely,\" Kyouko said.

\"But why now?\" Nadya asked. \"We\'ve spoken to Gracia. She says she\'s absolutely certain Misa\'s memories of the incident had been vacated. If that theory is true, she was no longer any threat.\"

\"Memory deletion is a very tricky business,\" Yuma said, pressing her fingers together. \"Most cases revert within a century, unless a deliberate effort is made to maintain the block. Assuming the memory deletion was done by a nefarious third party, they wouldn\'t have any certainty about being able to keep her from eventually remembering. They might have just been waiting for an opportunity to get rid of her less suspiciously.\"

\"If so, I\'d say it wasn\'t worth the effort,\" Nadya said. \"We\'re pretty suspicious now.\"

\"Yes, but they might not have expected us to be so alert,\" Kyouko said. \"That being said, it\'s entirely possible they had some other reason for acting when they did. Maybe they thought we were getting too close, and it was worth taking some risks or being a little more open.\"

\"Remember, even though the Ordo Illustrata signal was sent years ago, a couple of light‐years is meaningless in interstellar space,\" Clarisse said. \"It was only pure chance a science probe passed close enough to see it. They might not have expected things to come to a head so quickly. Imagine if we had already been looking for Misa for a decade before X‐25 happened. No one might have made the connection.\"

\"Even if it was just the wish, we are lucky,\" Nadya said. \"Even if it doesn\'t feel that way.\"

There was a moment of silence while they pondered that statement. Kyouko glanced at the presentation, then fast‐forwarded to the slides about Misa Virani. She was starting to regret bothering to make it---the discussion was proceeding perfectly fine on its own, if a bit meandering.

\"A disturbing thought comes to mind,\" Yuma said. \"This conspiracy has shown considerable reach. This topic came up during the Leadership Committee meeting, but it is not inconceivable further attempts on some of us might be made, or might have already been made without us realizing. For instance, you were present when the Institute for Theoretical Gravitonics was sabotaged on Eurydome.\"

The last statement was directed at Kyouko, who glanced around at Clarisse and Nadya for their reactions. They seemed interested, not puzzled, which meant that they had done the classified reading Yuma had granted them. She shouldn\'t really have expected otherwise out of Ancients before a truly important meeting, but... well, sometimes people got busy. One of the reasons she had made a presentation about everything was that it gave her a non‐awkward way to inform Nadya and Clarisse about specific topics. It seemed she had underestimated them.

\"Personally, I rather doubt the sabotage was directed at me,\" Kyouko said. \"My visit to the facility was not pre‐planned, and the room I was standing in didn\'t even collapse. If anything, my presence there helped to save Shizuki Ryouko\'s life.\"

\"Might she be a target too?\" Nadya asked.

\"Quite possibly,\" Kyouko said. \"I can\'t help but remember that she helped keep me from making the wrong decision on X‐25, and it was her partner and friend who detected the hidden nuclear device. If she had died on Eurydome, we would have died on X‐25.\"

\"But that\'s all just coincidence,\" Yuma said. \"Even I\'m not paranoid enough to think that they tried to kill her to try to make X work. How would anyone predict that?\"

*There was clearly one entity who did,* Kyouko thought, casting the thought so that only Clarisse could hear it. *I only took an interest and followed Ryouko to Eurydome because of the Goddess, and she only came with me to X‐25 for the same reason. But how would that justify anyone who is* not *the Goddess trying to kill her?*

*And before the assassination attempt she hadn\'t even been sure she was going to come with me,* Kyouko thought, this time to herself. *If this conspiracy was trying to keep her from going to X‐25, their attempt backfired spectacularly.*

\"I don\'t know,\" Kyouko admitted. \"I also can\'t help remembering that she was on board the transport vessel that was mysteriously attacked deep in our space by a squid raiding party. It all seems suspiciously coincidental, but in ways that don\'t make any sense.\"

\"Let\'s leave Ryouko aside for now,\" Yuma said. \"I want to talk about one of the elephants in the room. What does everyone think about Homura? Do any of us think she might be behind all this?\"

There was a pause, as everyone avoided each other\'s eyes for a moment.

\"I wouldn\'t say she\'s *incapable* of it,\" Clarisse said. \"But I wouldn\'t say it\'s likely to be her. If nothing else, she always seemed too ethically grounded to do any of the things we saw on X‐25, even indirectly. The statue could easily just be a coincidence.\"

\"I might be terrified of coincidences now,\" Kyouko said, \"but I have to agree it just doesn\'t sound like her.\"

*And she would never act against her own Goddess,* Kyouko thought. *The Goddess clearly didn\'t approve of X‐25.*

\"I could see her being involved, if she thought it was for the greater good somehow,\" Yuma said. \"If she came to think that cloning magical girls was the only way to win the war, then she would do it. And it must be said: we don\'t know what she *is* doing.\"

\"It just doesn\'t seem like something she would really do,\" Clarisse said.

Another long pause followed.

\"Back to Shizuki Ryouko, then,\" Nadya said, tapping a finger into the table. \"I can\'t honestly say I know her very well, but I read the information I was sent. Is it true? Someone has constructed a human as deviant as this?\"

\"It is true,\" Yuma said, answering the rhetorical question. \"I would say it is unfair to call her deviant, given that she shows every other sign of being perfectly normal, but the question of what the extra brain tissue does must be answered, especially given how important she turned out to be to the course of the war.\"

\"I didn\'t mean anything negative by it,\" Nadya said. \"Only in purely genetic terms.\"

\"Has there been any progress in figuring it out?\" Clarisse asked.

\"It\'s still being worked on,\" Yuma said. \"It\'s not easy doing this without access to the original subject, even if we have access to the genetic survey and previous medical records. A lot of it has to be done based on simulation. At first we were worried that it was some kind of remote control module, or a kill switch, but that has been definitely ruled out at this point---it just doesn\'t seem to have the right connections to the brain stem or the neocortex. It doesn\'t have access to sensory input either, and has no implants other than the generic neural support implants.\"

\"So what *does* it connect to?\" Nadya asked. \"It can\'t just sit there doing nothing!\"

\"I was getting there,\" Yuma said. \"As far as we can tell, it\'s primarily connected to the regions of the brain most associated with emotion, things like the basal ganglia and amygdala, along with the speech centers. As far as we can tell, it doesn\'t have much in the way of connections going out, either---most information seems to be flowing in, rather than out. It would explain why it wasn\'t easy to notice during TacComp installation.\"

\"What could the purpose of *that* be, though?\" Clarisse asked. "Gathering emotional information and what she\'s talking about? That\'s oddly unambitious, given a modification pattern of this complexity.\"

\"And of course, there\'s no actual implants to transmit the information anywhere, if that is the purpose,\" Yuma said. \"Or implants to receive any information, if this were a control device.\"

She paused for a moment, glancing around at the other three.

\"We\'re definitely not at the bottom of this. This isn\'t just an expansion or a reuse of existing neural wiring paradigms, or a new set of regulators for generating new tissue---there is new metabolism going on, new neurotransmitters, new biochemistry. This is immensely sophisticated work, but we don\'t know to what purpose. I\'ve had to swear the biologists to absolute secrecy. About the only thing anyone can grasp yet is that the new neurotransmitters might be just to prevent crosstalk---to guarantee effective isolation of the internal processes.\"

\"And I\'m sure we don\'t have to tell you what unusually sophisticated, secret scientific work sounds like,\" Kyouko said.

\"Except if it was the same group, why would they try to kill her?\" Nadya asked, shaking her head. \"It doesn\'t make sense.\"

\"Maybe they\'re not the same group,\" Clarisse said. \"Or maybe they were trying to kill her to get rid of the evidence somehow.\"

Nadya closed her eyes for a moment.

\"With all due respect,\" she said. \"If the problem is that she can\'t be studied directly, why not ask her to submit to a more thorough examination? Nothing bad, just a full check‐up. I\'m sure if she was told it had something to do with her implants, it would be no problem.\"

Yuma smiled slightly.

\"I\'m already working on it. Shizuki Sayaka has offered a particularly effective solution.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Complete power loss?\" Natsume and Elisa asked incredulously, almost in unison.

\"Yes, so it seems,\" their vehicle informed them placidly over the intercom. \"For your safety, it is recommended you stay inside the vehicle until power is restored.\"

It wasn\'t clear that the group had much of a choice, since they were still firmly ensconced in one of Paris\'s municipal tunnels. Bathed in the eerie backup lighting of the vehicle, the tunnel outside looked dark and foreboding, empty of the bright displays that usually served as decoration. Perhaps most disconcertingly, Clarisse\'s avatar had vanished along with everything else, leading to bitter complaints delivered directly into Ryouko\'s mind, which synergized most pleasantly with the over‐worried messages of her ostensible bodyguards, also trapped around them in the municipal tunnel system.

*No thank you,* Ryouko thought, refusing an offer of an emergency teleport out. *I could do it myself if I had to, obviously. We can wait for now.*

\"Do we have any idea how long that is going to take?\" Natsume demanded of the vehicle, clearly angry. \"Or any idea what\'s caused this?\"

\"No estimate for repair has yet been produced,\" the vehicle said. "The electrical power underlying most of this district\'s power usage has gone offline for unknown reasons. Backup non‐electrical power transmission systems remain online. Rest assured, core services, including communication services, are still online.\"

\"But not transit apparently,\" Elisa said, looking bemused. \"I don\'t think I\'ve *ever* seen a failure in the power grid.\"

*She\'s correct,* Clarisse thought. *The last time there was an unscheduled outage in Paris was a decade after the Unification Wars.*

Natsume, for her part, was tilting her head, obviously engaging in some unspoken communication even if she wasn\'t making the usual hand‐on‐ear signal. It seemed like whatever she was hearing was not pleasant.

\"I have bad news,\" she said, finally. \"The facility we were going to was affected, and they don\'t want to run any new simulations until they are sure everything is back in working order. They won\'t be available again for at least 24 hours.\"

Asami made a displeased noise.

\"That\'s a real shame,\" Elisa said. \"I had been looking forward to this.\"

The actor closed her eyes for a long moment, and though Ryouko felt it odd to try to read what looked like her own face, she felt as if Elisa was deeply perplexed about something.

\"Do we have any more information about just what happened?\" she asked, finally.

Natsume tilted her head again, blinking slightly.

\"They haven\'t told me anything special,\" she said. \"But, I suppose we should make lemonade of lemons. We can do something else.\"

\"Couldn\'t we go to another facility?\" Asami suggested. \"This is just one district of the city.\"

Natsume shook her head.

\"I wouldn\'t have the same kind of access I do here. It would be an inferior experience.\"

\"Well, what then?\" Airi asked.

\"Well, I guess we can just sort of wait,\" Natsume said.

Ryouko started to nod, then put her hand to her ear, accidentally mimicking Asami.

*Paging all teleporters, mobility specialists, and others with relevant skills,* the message said. *We have a major incipient demon spawn underway in the Phantasos District. A local power outage has interrupted transit and we need everyone capable of moving MSY personnel into the area on site immediately. Coordinates are enclosed. Your cooperation is appreciated.*

\"We have a problem,\" Ryouko said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"A demon spawn, huh?\" Kyouko said.

\"Yes,\" Yuma said, holding the telepathy‐enhancing Incubator up to her ear as if that actually helped. \"A really big one.\"

\"That sounds a little familiar,\" Kyouko said.

\"Yes,\" Yuma agreed again, letting a little bit of annoyance show on her face. Shizuki Sayaka\'s suggestion had been great: Invite Ryouko to a VR session, use the opportunity to do some detailed brain scans. It should have gone swimmingly, except for a mystery power outage and demon spawn.

\"Someone doesn\'t want us studying her too carefully,\" Kyouko said.

\"We should wait to verify,\" Yuma said. \"I\'ve already made sure someone checks the area for evidence afterward, but there\'s no guarantee anyone would have left any. If it\'s the same people, they\'re probably more careful after getting found out last time.\"

It was conspiratorial thinking to conclude that this series of coincidences necessarily had something to do with Ryouko, but she had come to find that paranoia was always well‐warranted.

\"What about the power outage?\" Clarisse said. \"Have there been any updates about that?\"

Yuma shook her head.

\"It\'s still a mystery. The system recorded a massive, broadly‐distributed drain on the grid, too huge to be anything normal, so it cut the connections momentarily. When it tried to bring them back online, though, nothing was responsive. Even the monitoring and repair drones seem to be offline. Human personnel are en route, but it\'s taking time with the transit systems down. Even emergency power is unresponsive.\"

Clarisse wrinkled her brow.

\"This is a new one. Something that drains power?\"

\"And not localized either,\" Yuma added, \"which is the only way it could have even happened without tripping a current limiter or overloading a cable. Even superconducting cable has its limits.\"

She paused, watching Nadya out of the corner of her eye. Unlike the others, and unlike her usual self, Nadya had spent much of the conversation silent, leaning forward with hands clasped and eyes unfocused.

\"Is something bothering you?\" Yuma asked.

Nadya looked away for a moment, clearly thinking about what to say.

\"*I* have seen something like this before,\" she said. \"But it\'s not possible.\"

\"Well, don\'t beat around the bush,\" Kyouko said. \"Tell us what\'s not possible already.\"

\"Draining power was one of Misa Virani\'s favorite tricks,\" Nadya said. \"Rather than exert herself trying to make electricity *ex nihilo*, it was usually much easier to extract existing current and redirect it into a target. Even the squid use enough electricity in their bases to make it work sometimes, and it\'s double the damage---sap one system, destroy another. It has the added bonus that most systems are designed to protect against big surges, rather than big drains.\"

There was a long silence as they thought about what she said.

\"You\'re right, that doesn\'t really make any sense,\" Kyouko said.

\"Yes,\" Nadya agreed, talking into her fist. \"But if the technicians find that everything in the area has been fried, I don\'t really know what else could have done it.\"

\"There are other electricity‐based mages in the MSY,\" Clarisse suggested.

\"Maybe,\" Nadya said.

She paused for a moment.

\"None like her though.\"

Yuma let out a breath.

\"Well I would say it\'s time we left these caves, and got back to somewhere where we can observe the situation more closely,\" she said.

\"What are we going to do about Ryouko?\" Kyouko said.

\"We\'ll just have to keep trying,\" Yuma said. \"If there\'s someone really trying to stop us, it\'s only going to get more obvious. If there isn\'t, then we\'ll know what we want soon enough.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*We need reinforcements near the concert hall,* a voice relayed into Ryouko\'s mind.

She was already reacting to the message, the relevant tactical information and context dropped into her cortex faster than the thought could really transmit. A small group of local volunteers had already formed an impromptu bomb squad---a bit non‐standard, with a melee lancer, water mage, and mind‐controller in place of the usual area damage focus, but it had the barrier generator, so it would have to do.

A moment later they appeared next to the concert hall in question, in the middle of the main thoroughfare. The barrier generator threw up a barrier of cold blue light against the horde of demons as they spared a fraction of a second to scan for errant civilians. They were supposed to have been cleared, but you could never quite be sure...

The barrier generator ducked and squealed as part of her shield warped and flickered away under a ferocious bombardment, but the others were already making their moves. Giant metallic lances sprouted from the ground around them, impaling what they could as a stampede of water‐formed horses charged through the area, scattering all in their path. Meanwhile, the telepath turned any still active demons away towards their brethren, and Ryouko fired an explosive bolt for good measure.

It was messy, and had plenty of anti‐synergy, the giant lances and stampeding horses actively interfering with each other\'s action. But, it was at least effective.

*Goddess, that\'s a lot of demons,* thought the girl who had protected them, getting up from a crouch. *I\'m not usually a barrier generator.*

*Sakura Kyouko fan?* the water mage asked the lancer.

*Says the girl with horses straight out of---*

The banter was cut short as the lancer in question dodged an attack, stabbing her lance into a nearby building for leverage.

*Keep them off me!* the water mage demanded. *I need more time to---shit!*

The girl ducked out of the way of a laser while keeping her hands together in a prayer pose.

*I need more time to charge an attack! What are you doing?*

*This isn\'t exactly easy!* the mind‐controller protested, trying to fulfill the request.

Ryouko bit back a sense of disapproval, keeping it from entering the team telepathic network, focusing instead on picking off what she could with her arbalest. She had to remember that these were Parisian socialites, too old to have undergone combat training, old enough to find exemptions from combat. They wouldn\'t have the usual cohesion or cold sense of mission.

Not for the first time she found herself missing Asami, who had been assigned to another team to try and distribute the veterans evenly among the various teams. Ryouko wasn\'t really sure that this was the best way to do it, but she supposed she wasn\'t the one making the decisions.

\"Why are they demanding we hold the line anyway?\" the \"barrier generator\" complained---out loud, the slowest communication method---edging towards Ryouko for a sense of safety as she waved giant fists of light back and forth, shadowboxing demons at range.

*I don\'t know,* Ryouko thought back. *They must be hard up for someone in this area.*

*Why isn\'t there anyone else here to back us up?* the water mage demanded, finally unleashing another stampede of horses. *I\'ve never seen it this bad!*

*I don\'t---*

Ryouko barely twisted aside as a dozen or so demons materialized through the wall of the concert hall, firing as they went. The girl next to her spun around, throwing up another shield that lasted only a few seconds before shattering.

She screamed, but Ryouko knew she couldn\'t turn to look, focusing instead on the horde with her weapon leveled, gritting her teeth. As a teleporter, she could dodge more effectively than any of the others, and if she just got their attention---

She teleported three meters upward, dodging a fusillade of beams, before immediately teleporting five meters to the right, dodging what she knew would be a follow‐up attack---

But she paused, since the follow‐up attack never came.

*Damn it Shizuki‐san, don\'t get killed over there! I\'ll never hear the end of it!* she distantly registered Kuroi Eri complaining. She had been split from her bodyguard teams too as part of the demon hunt, though they didn\'t like it one bit.

She watched as orange and green beams pulsated out of the arcade across the street, filleting the demons that had been tracking her. She didn\'t look for the source, though nothing on her tactical readout indicated just *who* it had been.

*Finally!* the mind‐controller thought, crouching next to the barrier generator, who was whimpering with a broken leg. This wasn\'t the time, of course, and any neophyte knew how to shut down pain---

Ryouko shut down her own complaints as a fresh set of demons appeared down the street, already substantially reduced by the incoming beams. In her head, she heard the demands:

*Unidentified magical girls, identify yourselves!*

*This isn\'t a game! Identify yourselves!*

She didn\'t wait for the response, even as it never came. Someone had to carry these newbies, and she didn\'t have time to worry about idiots who didn\'t identify themselves, *especially* because they were doing a remarkably good job, combat coordination or no. She just hoped they had good enough aim not to hit any of them.

*On your feet!* she ordered, firing as she moved forward, teleporting evasively as she went. *A broken bone is nothing you can\'t shut out! Follow my lead!*

For perhaps the first time, she felt herself aware of the demeanor she cut in battle, the terrifying focus that others found difficult to comprehend. Was this what Kyouko had meant, when she had said that Ryouko seemed to enjoy it?

She felt a smile creep onto her face for a moment, before she glanced at the girls on the ground and saw that they hadn\'t moved.

Clarisse slid her consciousness into shallow command mode, starting to plot out tentative combat tactics for the team. Ryouko, who had only a brief instant to decide what to do, picked something likely‐seeming to act on.

*Get up!* Ryouko yelled telepathically in frustration, trying to channel the team leaders she remembered from training. *On your feet!*

The barrier generator made a piteous noise as she was yanked to her feet, but quieted abruptly when she peered into Ryouko\'s eyes. A galloping water‐horse thundered past.

*Get that barrier back up!* Ryouko instructed. *You, make us some space and then converge on me.*

She gestured at the girl with the spears.

*Cover our backs.*

Her orders seemed to inspire the other girls into action. The water elemental charged her horses in a wide arc while a set of spears lanced out, driving away the demons not already under the mind‐controller\'s renewed influence, giving them some breathing room. No one seemed to be bothered by the fact that they were taking orders from a fifteen‐year‐old; probably, they just hadn\'t realized.

Ryouko gave another set of orders, this time silent and at the speed of thought, and the others responded immediately.

The water mage shimmered blue as spears rattled out, punching into demons at a frenetic pace, demons disappearing in eerie silence or struggling against grievous loss of integrity. A great torrent of water built up silently behind their barrier.

A moment later their barrier popped out of existence, and a tsunami of horses crashed outwards, accentuated by a fusillade of bolts from Ryouko\'s arbalest. Another barrage of green and orange tore apart the dregs of what remained in the area.

*Alright,* thought Ryouko, taking in a breath. *But we need to move.*

Without waiting for a response, Ryouko grabbed the girls around her and blinked away into another cluster of demons that had been bearing in on them. The barrier went up again as another barrage of spears flew out.

Then the tsunami swept into the demons again, but the barrier generator strained visibly against another fusillade of demon lasers.

*Shizuki‐san, we are inbound from the west,* Shizuki Elanis, Ryouko\'s other bodyguard, called out, apparently having received permission to try and help. *Hold on!*

*I need fire support,* Ryouko transmitted back, noting that this bodyguard was part of a medium‐range bombardment team. *Wait for a signal.*

*Ready on your mark,* Elanis replied after a pause.

Ryouko looked up at the sky, running the next set of actions through her head as Clarisse fed her with plausible battle‐tested tactics, running whatever cursory simulations she was capable of. It wasn\'t even remotely a good approximation of the usual battlefield, where she would have had access to the advice of combat AIs all the way up the command chain, but part of having trained for MagOps was learning to deal with fighting with only the brains of you and your squadmates.

Still, command was very different, and there was no getting around that.

She plotted out a teleport straight up, where her team would unload everything it had straight down, accentuated by the input of the other team. Her team managed the barest of confirmations before it happened.

They blinked away. A moment later the immediate area was saturated in multicolored light, ripping apart demons and denuding the shrubbery. Ryouko and her team reappeared twenty meters up, weapons and water pouring downward in a vast, lethal blast wave as they began to fall.

The smile came back to Ryouko\'s face. Maybe she did enjoy this too much, and maybe she *was* different, but right now, it really didn\'t seem to matter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"And I must say, it\'s quite an honor to be able to work together with the Hero of Orpheus,\" the leader of the local demon hunting team---a certain Annette François---said, shaking Ryouko\'s hand and smiling winningly.

\"No, uh, it\'s my honor,\" Ryouko said, rubbing the back of her head in embarrassment. \"It was really no trouble at all, and you know, I feel like demon hunting team leaders are underappreciated.\"

Behind her, she heard Asami suppress a reaction, and turned her head slightly to look. Had she said something wrong?

\"Anyway, it felt surprisingly good to be back in action, just a little,\" Ryouko added.

Annette nodded, peering for a moment over the dim landscape where the members of her team were still working to corral stray civilians. The "sky\" of the Phantasos Sector was normally supposed to be the brilliant, ever‐changing landscapes of fantastical worlds, but was at the moment being run in emergency mode, serving as this world\'s biggest emergency notification board. It estimated that power would be back in a half‐hour, once a new emergency interconnect was built to the next district over. Ryouko wondered why there hadn\'t *already* been such an interconnect---or if something had happened to it.

\"Some of my girls will want your autograph when this is all over with,\" Annette said. \"I\'ve assigned them extra tasks for now to stall them, in case you want to disappear.\"

\"It\'s fine,\" Ryouko said, ducking her head to hide her expression. "I don\'t want to be like that.\"

She had already signed a few for her own team, after all.

\"Like the snipers?\" Annette asked, tilting her head. \"Yes, that was weird. Normally, mages with the opportunity to help out can\'t talk enough about it. I\'ve never had anyone take out that many demons from a distance and then just *leave*.\"

\"I bet they were important people,\" Asami said. \"I can understand. You don\'t want to make a big fuss by showing up, and if you happen to have a long‐range magical power...\"

Asami let her voice trail off, then shrugged.

\"I guess,\" Ryouko said. \"It wouldn\'t be a very good disguise. There can\'t be that many girls out there with long‐range green and orange magic. If we also know it\'s someone who\'s trying to hide their identity...\"

\"Let\'s be respectful,\" Annette said. \"Besides, it\'s not like anyone can run a personnel search like that on a whim. You\'d have to have pretty high access for that.\"

\"I suppose,\" Ryouko said.

\"I guess I\'m glad we had their help, whoever they were,\" Annette said. \"They really helped clear a lot of the more troublesome spawn locations.\"

\"Yeah,\" Asami agreed. \"This was a really a big one, wasn\'t it?\"

\"Yes,\" Annette said. \"And we had no idea it was coming, which makes it idiosyncratic. I never like seeing those. I once lost a rookie to that kind of demon spawn.\"

\"I\'m sorry to hear that,\" Asami said.

Ryouko tuned out of the conversation, even as Annette and Asami began to chat happily about what it was like to be in a relationship with a celebrity. Something about this whole situation just bothered her. There were too many strange things going on at the same time. A woman named Natsume she didn\'t entirely trust, an extremely rare power outage, an "idiosyncratic\" demon spawn, mysterious magical girls...

\"*How is it going over there?*\" Natsume asked, texting her over the usual civilian channel. \"*Is everything alright?*\"

*Speak of the devil,* Clarisse commented.

It was a reasonable question to ask, though. Ryouko had dropped off the civilians in a reasonable location near a local café before joining the demon hunt, and it was only natural for the others to get a little worried, or perhaps even impatient, cooling their heels without any good transit or entertainment options.

\"*Everything is fine,*\" Ryouko responded. \"*We\'re actually done here.*\"

\"*That\'s good to hear. Listen, I\'ve been doing some research on what your interests are, and I have a new idea for where we could go in the city, if you can teleport us out of this district. You interested?*\"

Ryouko let out a breath, consciously doing her best to set her suspicions aside.

\"*Yeah I suppose I am,*\" she sent back.

After the fight she had just had, she had no desire to go back to sitting in her hotel or wandering the city. She hoped Natsume had come up with something more interesting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"On the distant ocean world of Lei Feng, where global storms and five hundred kilometer winds ravage tiny pockets of land and newly‐founded floating cities, the unexpected melting of the polar ice caps brings a new year of warmer, calmer weather, a boon to the tattered colonists of this beaten world. But something completely unexpected lies on the horizon...\"

Ryouko sucked at her strawberry‐and‐sugar drink through a straw. Natsume\'s suggestion that they visit the Paris archives had come as a welcome surprise to Ryouko, who had expected another bar or VR attraction. Instead, they were watching holographic diodramas, which felt like a welcome change. Rather than spending the next couple of hours trying to be interested in an exhaustive set of social exchanges, she could just sit and bask in the educational stylings of one of Earth\'s best museums.

\"Seriously, who writes this stuff?\" Elisa asked, grousing sourly in her seat. \"If they needed a consultant on how to properly be melodramatic, they could have asked me! I wouldn\'t have even charged that much.\"

\"Now, now Elisa,\" Airi said. \"They\'re not trying to make a big‐budget movie. This is just historical documentary‐type stuff. Educational museum stuff, you know.\"

Ryouko did her best to tune them out, casting a glance at Asami and squeezing her hand. The somewhat pretentiously‐named Archives of Man was one of the most prestigious modern museums in the world, constructed in a region of aboveground, central Paris damaged in the war, and as such had taken a disturbingly long trip for them to get to.

She didn\'t exactly broadcast the fact, but she *loved* this kind of colonial documentary, and had spent much of her childhood watching similar productions on the internet. She probably should have been disturbed that Natsume had been able to guess at her interests, but Ryouko was far too used to that kind of thing by now.

\"As the cloud cover of the world begins to clear around the equator, the vast oceans fill with plankton, forming streaks of green and red on a once monotone sea. The ocean‐going colonists marvel at this phenomenon. The climatologists, though, begin to grow alarmed. The balance of this world is shifting, and the two extremes of the planet begin to once again drift away from each other.\"

She felt Asami shift slightly, and couldn\'t help but cringe a little in empathy. The red plankton on the holographic ocean spread out in front of them looked unsettlingly crimson, and while Ryouko could push the effect out of her mind, she didn\'t blame Asami for reacting a little. In fact, if she recalled correctly, hadn\'t they both been involved in some kind of ocean training scenario?

Before she could reflect on that thought for too long, she realized that Asami\'s reaction had knocked her out of her immersion.

She sighed, glancing around at the others. These kinds of documentaries had indeed been one of her favorite pre‐contract entertainments, but ever since the raid on the wormhole generator, she had always found herself unable to focus on the content, even with the enhanced VR abilities of her military implants. She found that she kept being reminded of her own experiences, her own life, and it felt unsettling to her.

As she turned to try and focus her attention back on the documentary, she saw the door to their room slide open and a woman she didn\'t recognize walk in.

Strictly speaking, the diodrama rooms weren\'t private, but there were enough rooms in the massive Archives building that it was usually possible to assign each group their own room. That\'s what the museum AI, Alexis de Tocqueville, had said. Were there that many people here today? It wasn\'t a special event or holiday...

The woman chose the seat behind Ryouko, and without looking, she sensed the subtle aura of a magical girl. That wasn\'t that unusual, she supposed, even as Natsume turned to stare oddly at the newcomer.

*I\'m sorry to interrupt,* the new girl---a \"Rebecca Shu\"---thought, and Ryouko immediately noted that the thought had been directed specifically at Ryouko and Asami, an odd decision to make given the lack of other magical girls in their party.

She didn\'t say anything else, though, and it seemed like she was just apologizing for her presence. Ryouko nodded and turned back to watch the documentary, which by now was fully engaged in scenes of mayhem and destruction as a planetary superstorm ravaged Lei Feng, tossing aside what should have been storm‐hardened floating cities. Hastily summoned military starships struggled to move citizens to safety, the only ships at the time capable of operating in five hundred kilometer per hour winds, constant lightning strikes, and voluminous hail.

This was before the advent of the war, however, and there were only a few vessels that could arrive with such short notice. The deployment of additional patrol ships as a response to the Lei Feng incident would prove to be invaluable later, when the war came...

Ryouko frowned again. She knew the story of the Great Storm of Lei Feng, of course, but the narrative she wove in her mind as she watched the mixture of contemporary footage and dramatization had a decidedly military flavor to it that hadn\'t been there before.

*I can\'t believe how much they exaggerate it,* Rebecca thought. *It wasn\'t anywhere near as bad as this.*

Ryouko blinked, taking a long moment to pin down just what had been odd about the previous sentence.

*You were there?* Asami asked.

*Well, not me personally,* Rebecca thought. *But my family and the colony, yeah. I heard about it from them.*

*What did they change specifically?* Ryouko asked.

*Mostly just how much rescuing we needed,* Rebecca thought. *The military vessels were helpful, yes, and there were some of us that needed evacuation, but definitely not all of us, and our cities mostly did fine. The colony was* not *happy with how this ended up being portrayed. It\'s even a political issue over what\'s being taught in our schools.*

Ryouko frowned. She wasn\'t sure if she believed the truth of what Rebecca was saying, to be entirely honest. It sounded like exactly the kind of issue where the truth would get drastically inflated by generations of colonial pride.

*Wasn\'t this storm one of the justifications for increasing the size of the military patrol fleet?* Asami thought, surprising Ryouko with a piece of history she hadn\'t expected her to know. *Why would they do that if this isn\'t really what happened?*

Rebecca managed to convey what was somehow a telepathic shrug.

*No one knows. The popular theory is that Governance had some other reason for increasing the size of the fleet, but needed an excuse that would pass the politics of the time.*

With the apparent lull in the conversation, they turned their attention back to the diodrama, which was approaching a triumphant ending filled with resilient colonists and the sunshine of now‐clear skies. It made her uncomfortable, the possibility that one of the stories she had memorized about colonization had been exaggerated.

She also couldn\'t avoid sensing Natsume watching the three of them from the corner of her eye.

\"Anyway, this is all a bit coincidental,\" Rebecca said out loud, grabbing the attention of the others as they stood up out of their seats. \"I\'m here to put a stop to some shenanigans.\"

She looked pointedly at Natsume as she said this. Natsume, for her part, had developed a staunchly annoyed look on her face.

\"We had a deal, Madame Shu,\" Natsume said, switching abruptly into a Parisian French that Ryouko had to use her implants to translate.

\"There have been new developments,\" Rebecca said back in the same language. \"Your old friend has decided to intervene early. And you didn\'t even accomplish the mission.\"

\"You know very well the power went out. You know, it would be just her MO to cause an outage like that.\"

Ryouko stood there studying Natsume carefully, even as Asami and Airi looked back and forth with bewildered looks, so similar that an outside observer could easily have been convinced there was a mirror involved.

Rebecca shrugged.

\"No dirty tricks here,\" she said, \"Except from you. It seems maybe Lady Fortune doesn\'t like you?\"

Natsume made an annoyed, borderline angry noise, then reached up behind her ear.

Her face shimmered for a moment, then changed entirely, revealing the aristocratic features of Shizuki Sayaka.

*Of course,* Clarisse thought sourly, even as Ryouko\'s magical girl senses finally detected the now obvious soul gem signature. She wondered if the offended look on Clarisse\'s Ryouko avatar mirrored her own look. Between the two of them, the dyspeptic‐looking Elisa, and the obvious family resemblance of Sayaka, they must have made for an extraordinarily surreal sight.

\"Very well, the jig is up,\" Sayaka complained, in Standard. \"I just wanted to have a little anonymous fun. The young ones get so uptight when they know who I really am.\"

\"What are you doing here?\" Ryouko asked, unable to summon the level of anger she thought was appropriate to the situation.

\"Just showing you a good time,\" Sayaka said. \"It wasn\'t that bad, was it? If only the power hadn\'t gone out, it would have been great fun. It\'s been a long time since I indulged in a good VR sim.\"

\"We would have been happy to have you just as you are,\" Clarisse said, casting a withering look at Elisa that Ryouko knew she would never be able to duplicate.

Sayaka sighed, rubbing the temple of her head.

\"Yes, but you would have been too uptight.\"

She shrugged.

\"I mean it when I say I was just showing you a good time. Showing myself a good time too. I love doing excursions like this. I thought I\'d get to know my newly‐discovered granddaughter better. You can forgive an old lady, can\'t you?\"

Feeling the gaze of the room upon her, Ryouko made a non‐committal gesture.

\"I mean, it doesn\'t really matter, I guess,\" she said.

\"You may as well explain whatever reasons you have for interrupting us, then,\" Sayaka said, glaring at Rebecca. Her eyes transitioned from doe‐eyed to dagger‐filled with alarming rapidity, and Ryouko caught Rebecca flinching, just a tiny bit.

\"Kuroi Kana isn\'t appreciative of your game,\" Rebecca said, recovering and looking at Ryouko. \"Sayaka hardly has only the innocent motives she claims. She hopes to lure you into staying in Paris, and living the high life with her Matriarchy---\"

\"You act like that\'s a bad thing,\" Sayaka interjected.

\"---and there\'s something she\'s not telling you about the friendly VR session you had planned.\"

\"That it was a couples\' bonding scenario?\" Sayaka said, dryly. \"I was only trying to promote healthy relationships.\"

\"That you were going to scan her brain while doing it,\" Rebecca said.

Even as Ryouko blinked several times, trying to understand the ramifications of a *brain scan*, she couldn\'t help but see the anger gathering on Sayaka\'s brow---true anger, not the vaguely diffident emotions she usually affected.

\"Where does she get off, letting you reveal things like that?\" Sayaka said. \"She can\'t have, and if it\'s just you, then your head---\"

\"Au contraire, ma chérie,\" Rebecca countered. \"You‐know‐who has agreed to take a bit of a different tack this time, after hearing what we have to say. She doesn\'t care how we do it of course, so the dramatic entrance is merely a token of Kana\'s appreciation.\"

She turned towards Ryouko.

\"With your permission, Kuroi Kana would like to take you away from this little pleasure excursion and talk about more serious matters. With respect to Miss Yamada and Miss Nagato here, we will also be glad to take them along, provided they are willing to allow a few conversations to be held without them. It should give a unique look at your persons of study, after all.\"

Airi looked at Elisa, who appeared to think for a moment before shrugging broadly.

\"If that\'s how it is, then sure, I\'ll go,\" she said. \"I find it odd that you would just *assume* she\'d go with you. Maybe she\'d rather finish enjoying a day off first? I imagine she must be rather annoyed at all this right now.\"

\"*Exactly* what I was going to say,\" Sayaka agreed, raising a finger.

Ryouko, who *had* been getting rather annoyed, looked at Rebecca for an answer.

\"Well, I knew that would come up,\" Rebecca said, shaking her head slightly. \"Very well. It is not very widely known, but Kuroi Kana is a rare class of mage known as a *post*‐cognitive, one who has the ability to see the past. Unfortunately, like all such mages she has very little control over what she sees, which is why she found it so interesting that she had a vision about *you*.\"

\"Me?\" Ryouko echoed with automatic incredulity.

\"Yes,\" Rebecca answered. \"She thought it was something you should definitely know, rather than be kept a secret.\"

\"Well, if *I* may be so forward,\" Sayaka said, angling herself in between Ryouko and Rebecca. \"With the permission of Ryouko over here---\"

She nodded in Ryouko\'s direction.

\"---I\'d like to go along on this trip. I know I\'d be intruding on the hospitality of the Kuroi Matriarchy, but I\'d consider it a favor.\"

She peered at Ryouko for a moment, who made a bewildered expression, before spreading her hands to indicate that it didn\'t really matter to her.

\"I\'d have to ask for permission to do that,\" Rebecca said, looking nonplussed for the first time and chewing her lip awkwardly. \"One moment.\"

*I don\'t like this,* Asami thought. *Why couldn\'t we just be left alone for once?*

*I know,* Ryouko tried to say empathetically. *I know.*

\"She says fine,\" Rebecca concluded a moment later. \"It might even be interesting.\"

\"Then it will be just like old times,\" Sayaka said, smiling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It turned out that Kuroi was waiting for her aboveground, in a location just off the old Champs‐Élysées. The trip over was a struggle, their vehicle navigating the congested surface streets of Paris at a painfully low speed, avoiding other vehicles by only the narrowest of margins as uncooperative pedestrians conspired to keep Paris tied to the old ways. Clarisse had thoughtfully dematerialized her avatar so as to spare them having to get a bigger vehicle, and helpfully let Ryouko know that Paris was now a record holder in Governance\'s measurements of how long it took to get from point A to point B---a record holder in futility, that was.

She had to admit, though, that for a tourist it really wasn\'t all that bad. The city was home to some of the world\'s oldest still‐standing buildings, which served to give the place a sort of old‐world charm that was extremely difficult to find anywhere else. They ordered pastries and coffee en route, receiving it through the window from a cleverly designed refreshment drone, specially provided to relieve the tedium of traffic, and as she chewed the pastry she could see why Elisa and Sayaka had both refused to shortcut the trip with a teleportation jump or even an underground train ride. It was, as they had said, something to experience.

They made small talk as they went, Sayaka surprisingly congenial towards a girl who was apparently closely tied to a rival Matriarchy. As always, the Kuroi‐Shizuki feud was something Ryouko just didn\'t understand.

They finally stepped off in front of a large, regal‐looking building, almost church‐like in appearance, directly next door to a Governance physical office and an actual church, which seemed to be holding some kind of obscure ceremony. Wherever it was Ryouko had expected to end up, it was not here.

Despite its archaic appearance, the door to the building slid open as they approached, indicating the building wasn\'t perhaps as old as it appeared. Ryouko felt, rather than saw, a rather aggressive sensor scan pass over her.

\"The bodyguards can wait outside,\" Rebecca said, looking at Sayaka rather than Ryouko. \"If there is truly danger to her here, then I doubt they would do more than get in the way.\"

\"Fair enough,\" Sayaka shrugged.

Whereas the outside of the building had been old‐fashioned and magnanimous, suggestive of tall‐ceiling rooms open to the sun, the inside was vastly different, much closer to the type of building layout Ryouko was used to: a bit narrow, with ceilings at a normal height. Unusually, the few rooms she could peer into had no windows, adding an atypical, claustrophobic air---Governance was normally fully aware of the importance of sunlight to human happiness.

They walked briskly down a hall lined with mostly closed doors, the pace set by Rebecca. Asami, Airi, and Ryouko looked over their surroundings, Sayaka seemed uninterested, and Elisa seemed to be closely watching her.

At the end of the hallway was a nondescript but large elevator, with walls painted a marble‐black. It lay open at their approach, the doors closing behind them immediately after they stepped through, and Ryouko felt a slight chill---usually elevators could be summoned almost by subconscious instinct, and they always knew where you wanted to go. That was an expectation that had ingrained itself into her since childhood, and it bothered her that she could not *sense* the elevator\'s presence. It was not open to the usual command channels, even as it descended into the earth.

When the doors opened, they found themselves on the threshold of what appeared to be some kind of conference room. At the center was a long oval table, flanked on both sides by the same kind of marble‐black walls that had sheathed the elevator car. At regular intervals along the walls were framed portraits, each illuminated by a single lamp. Collectively, these lamps served as the room\'s only illumination.

A beeping noise called their attention to a server drone that had rolled up on Ryouko\'s right side, bearing a tray of filled wine glasses. Like the elevator, it had no sense of presence.

\"I thought I\'d spring for a little decadence today, seeing as my old friend has decided to regale us with her presence,\" Kuroi Kana said, appearing out of a door on the far side of the room. \"2200, a very interesting year.\"

Ryouko looked the Matriarch over, remembering abruptly the young girl she had seen in her vision of Yuma\'s past, uncomfortable and angry in front of Oriko. The girl wasn\'t physically much older, and unlike so many of the other Ancients she was failing to give any hint as to her great age, either in demeanor or posture. That seemed odd, since she would have thought Kana usually needed to radiate authority to fulfill her roles.

\"Fallout wine?\" Sayaka asked rhetorically, picking up a glass. \"You do* spoil us, even if the whole idea is a rather silly fad.\"

*Wine brewed by wine fanatics during the teeth of the Unification Wars, Clarisse filled in. *It is a tinge radioactive, and was only safe to consume after the completion of Project Eden. Supposedly it has an exotic mixture of tastes due to the mutated grapes.*

*I thought this looked* different, Ryouko thought, tilting a glass to try to scan it before setting it back down.

\"I apologize for the decoration of this room, but it\'s just theatre,\" Kana said. \"Ryouko, Sayaka, you may come with me; the rest of you should sit and make yourselves at home.\"

*And don\'t forget, my role in the Black Heart is secret from those not in the know,* Kana thought. *All the actors know is that I\'m a powerful Matriarch, like Shizuki here. Let\'s keep it that way.*

Ryouko walked hesitantly towards Kana, watching as the others took their seats and other drones rolled up with trays of sandwiches.

She and Sayaka followed Kana through the back door, down another narrow hallway, and into a brightly‐lit office, completely different in decor from the previous conference room. This one, with its worn‐looking modular desk, sitting couches, and plush carpeting, could almost be called homely.

Seeing her examining the paintings on the walls, Kana remarked:

\"Ah yes, these are the same paintings that are in the conference room. They depict the past achievements of the Black Heart. For what it\'s worth, there\'s another room just like it in Mitakihara. Stare as long as you like.\"

Ryouko did so for a long moment. Truth be told, she didn\'t recognize most of what was going on, save for a few that were obviously from the Unification Wars or even the current war. Some were uninterpretable without further context, such as one that depicted a group of girls infiltrating the former US capital. Others, though, were nearer to heart, such as the one which seemed to depict Mikuni Oriko, or the newest one, which depicted the wormhole mission and included Ryouko herself.

She turned back towards Kana a moment later, indicating she was ready for whatever this was.

\"Well, I let Sayaka be involved in this because this might be relevant to her,\" Kana said, sitting in the chair behind the desk. \"Please, take a seat.\"

They did so, Sayaka crossing her legs and making an arrogant expression.

\"But my original intention hadn\'t been to include her,\" Kana continued. \"I\'ll give you the option not to share with her what gets divulged, but I suspect you\'ll want to ask her some questions.\"

\"I suppose that\'s fair enough,\" Sayaka said. \"If it\'s private information, that is. My intention wasn\'t to be nosy; I just don\'t trust what she\'s trying to do here.\"

\"It *is* fair enough,\" Kana said, managing to sound mild saying it.

She turned back towards Ryouko.

\"Look, you\'re an adult now, or at least we\'re supposed to treat you like one. We all know I\'m a woman of secrets, but I try not to keep secrets for no reason. That being said, despite how flamboyantly Rebecca chose to come get you, I have quite a few reservations about this. She doesn\'t know the whole story, but I\'d like you to know I talked to a few people before doing this.\"

\"Uh, okay?\" Ryouko said, unsure how to respond.

\"I just wanted you to know my position,\" Kana said. \"I\'m not doing this to try to convince you of anything. I just... well, your aunt and I thought you deserved to know.\"

\"My aunt?\"

Kana nodded, then turned her chair towards the side door to her office, which slid open a moment later. Through it stepped her aunt, Kuroi Nana, and Patricia von Rohr, who was the last person she expected to see here. They looked nervous---Patricia even had her eyes downcast, and Nana in particular seemed to have somehow developed worry lines around an otherwise very young pair of eyes.

\"I will leave,\" Sayaka said, standing up abruptly. \"If it\'s this serious, I will be outside with the others.\"

\"As will I,\" Kana said, standing in turn. \"You may use my office. You can be assured no one will be listening in here. Come on, Sayaka‐chan.\"

\"\'Sayaka‐chan?\'\" Ryouko asked nervously, after the door closed behind them. It was a real question---the lack of open fighting between the two matriarchs surprised and unnerved her---but mostly she was confused. Confused, worried, and just a little terrified.

Nana, for her part, looked bothered as well, and no longer had the casual insouciance of their previous meeting.

She chose not to answer Ryouko\'s implicit question, either because she didn\'t know or simply didn\'t think it was important enough.

\"Ryouko, I want you to know, when we talked yesterday, I meant everything I said, about Akemi‐san, and about how I was going to meet you after you had spent some time with Shizuki Sayaka. There has been a sudden acceleration of plans, after the recent power outage, and I have... learned a few new things.\"

A heartbeat passed before Nana, pinning Ryouko with her eyes, seemed to nod to herself, and looked at Patricia, who was doing a poor job of concealing her own trepidation.

\"I will let her explain the first part of this,\" Nana said.

Patricia shook her head in dismay, but said:

\"You remember the time I asked to take a detailed sample of your genome?\"

\"Y--yes?\" Ryouko asked, knowing this could go nowhere good. \"Those results came back showing nothing new.\"

\"Well, no, I lied,\" Patricia said bluntly. \"Of course, I never would have even asked for a detailed sample if I hadn\'t already suspected something was different, but the results were unusual enough that we kept it a secret.\"

Ryouko blinked, paused, then leaned forward, putting her hands on her head. It seemed to her that the world was shifting around her, and she supposed that wasn\'t necessarily that far from the truth.

\"So what am I then, some kind of mutant?\" she said, stating the first possibility that came to her mind. It wouldn\'t be that bad, just being different---wouldn\'t even necessarily be that surprising. But then why was this meeting so important?

\"No, not quite,\" Patricia said, clasping her hands and looking askance. \"If it were just a matter of the genes in your skin that would be the most likely conclusion. But when I ran a secondary study on that genome, parts of it seemed a little too coincidental, small differences that somehow seemed to work together, or result in subtle modifications of protein function. More importantly, neither of the genomes of your parents on file showed any of these changes.\"

Ryouko felt herself going pale, but nodded slightly, unable to say anything else in response.

Patricia took an obvious deep breath.

\"There\'s no way to say this but to just say it,\" she confessed. "When I then went on to take a more detailed sample, the nanites discovered a completely novel region of your brain, which I could not find any other examples of in the Governance archives. This region has a genome completely different from the rest of your body, and there is no doubt it is genetically engineered, as it contains protein families and regulatory networks that have never previously been observed.\"

For a moment Ryouko\'s sense of the world drained away and, rather than the two girls in front of her watching her in concern, or the paintings on the wall, or any of the elements of reality, she saw only the words Patricia had just said, and felt only the reflected shock of Clarisse in her head.

\"We don\'t know what function this modification serves,\" Patricia said, desperate to fill the abrupt vacuum in the conversation. \"It apparently caused considerable difficulty in your revival after your last bodyloss, since your clone did not have the proper region, and we had not been confident your soul gem restored it correctly. We want to take another, more functional scan of your brain activity, in the hope that we can have some answers. We know you have no idea about any of this.\"

\"What does it do?\" Ryouko asked quietly, finally, looking up.

\"We don\'t know,\" Patricia said. \"Someone went to tremendous trouble to design something like this, but without further data, predicting operational function from only a genome and the vaguest of data is a tremendous modeling task. All we know for now is that it connects to some emotional, speech, and auditory‐related areas. To alleviate the obvious concerns, it doesn\'t seem to have any of the right connections to affect your behavior, personality, or decision‐making. But you can obviously see why we\'d want to perform a more detailed scan.\"

Ryouko put her head in her hands again. How exactly could she react, how could anyone react, to such a surreal truth as this? She had always felt human, no different from anyone else. She had always felt---

\"What am I then?\" she repeated, again not really knowing the meaning of the question. \"Someone\'s pet project? Why? What purpose could it serve?\"

\"Well, we don\'t know,\" Patricia said. \"We could only know by gathering more information.\"

\"And what does this mean about Mama?\" Ryouko asked, looking up with eyes widened with a new realization. \"Did my parents---\"

\"That\'s why I\'m here,\" Nana said, cutting off Ryouko\'s train of thought efficiently. \"Thankfully, I think we can rule out your mother or father willfully lying to you. But I\'m not sure the truth is any better.\"

\"What is that supposed to mean?\" Ryouko asked, even as she felt a vast, unexpected relief to hear her parents somehow absolved. \"How could they possibly not know?\"

Nana looked aside for a moment, clasping her hands together in a small gesture of nervousness. She looked deeply bothered about something, perhaps even... angry?

\"Well, that\'s where our matriarch\'s vision comes into play,\" she said. \"But first: Do you remember Chitose Yuma\'s birthday party?\"

Ryouko blinked, even as she felt sick to her stomach. She was confused by the seeming non sequitur.

\"Yes, I do,\" she said. \"What about it?\"

\"While you were at the party, an attempt was made to question your mother about what had been found. The line of questioning ran into what\'s called an implanted psychic defense, a mechanism installed in someone\'s mind by a trained telepath to prevent questioning on a particular topic. It became clear that your mother---my sister\'s mind has been tampered with, to remove memories pertaining to your... modifications. We would not be able to remove this mechanism without potentially significant risk, so this has not been attempted.\"

Nana paused, closing her eyes for a moment.

\"I would like you to know, I was not told any of this until today,\" she added. \"It is troubling, and infuriating, to know that someone has been toying with my family like this.\"

Nana spoke slowly, almost tiredly, but Ryouko could see anger flicker in her eyes for the briefest of moments.

She knew she should share it, but for now felt just an icy calm, the kind of calm that probably came only before a storm.

\"And Papa...?\" she asked, following the chain of logic in whatever way seemed natural.

\"A more careful attempt was made to probe him on the matter, this time with a trained telepath. He seems to be in the exact same situation.\"

Ryouko frowned, and tried to think back. She could remember catching a few hints of some old disagreement her parents had carried, something about her, something they tried to keep from her. But, she didn\'t know enough to infer what it was they had disagreed about, and had no reason to believe it was even related. After all, they weren\'t even supposed to remember what had happened.

\"Are you okay?\" Nana asked, putting a hand on Ryouko\'s shoulder in concern. Ryouko realized she had turned her attention away from the conversation entirely, focusing inward on her own thoughts.

\"I am *not* okay,\" Ryouko said, almost bitterly, without meeting anyone\'s eyes. \"How could I be?\"

She sensed, rather than saw, Nana and Patricia share a look.

\"If it helps anything,\" Nana said, audibly nervous. \"You weren\'t made in a lab. That was what the Director\'s vision was about. Being a magically‐induced vision, there has not been enough time to try to convert it into a memory that can be shared.\"

She paused, thinking about what to say.

\"I can only tell you what she told me. It was a very unclear vision, giving random pieces of the past, and it was lucky she was able to figure out what the vision was even about. Apparently, your parents were asked to participate in an experimental study regarding the development of the next generation of implants. Your father talked your mother into it, but the study was a failure, and they were told you would be unusually likely to contract. But the vision made clear there never really was a study.\"

Ryouko could feel her aunt watching her, but didn\'t feel motivated to respond. Finally, Nana continued:

\"Kana has been reviewing the vision, but it is frustratingly unclear who the participants in the sham were. She had some glimpses of someone altering your parents\' exact memories, others of someone designing the region in your brain, and one of... a machine performing some operation on your mother, something that wasn\'t in the agreement. I am sorry to be so graphic.\"

The last line came in hasty response to Ryouko sucking in a breath and grabbing the armrests of her chair, ducking her head and tightening her muscles in instinctive preparation for a physiological reaction, be it of disgust or anger. But Clarisse, who had constantly been hovering worriedly in the background, had suppressed any such reflexes.

\"Why tell me any of this?\" Ryouko asked. \"Who does it help to tell me? Why now, and not sooner, or later?\"

There was a long silence, as the others seemed to struggle to formulate a response, until finally Kuroi Kana herself appeared in the doorway.

\"I have learned over the years that my visions, such as they are, never occur without a reason,\" she said, stepping through the threshold.

\"I was summoned,\" she added a moment later, seeing Ryouko\'s look. \"I wasn\'t listening in.\"

Since the room was out of chairs---Patricia having taken hers---she stood leaning against her desk.

\"It wasn\'t just that, or I would have still been very skeptical about telling you,\" Kana said. \"But there is reason to believe that whoever is behind your modifications is aware that we know now, and is trying to prevent further investigation. That is why I brought you here. I was monitoring your whole approach to the building. They wouldn\'t move so openly in aboveground Paris.\"

\"How do you know?\" Ryouko asked, though she doubted Kana could tell her.

\"The Far Seers,\" she said.

\"The what?\" Ryouko asked, after a confused moment.

*The Far Seers,* Clarisse thought. *A secret society of the MSY\'s most talented clairvoyants, diviners, and information mages, devoted to using magical means to collect all there is to know about past, present and, hopefully, future, whenever conventional methods fail. Like the Black Heart, their existence is an open secret among senior officials in the MSY, but is technically classified on a need‐to‐know basis. Unlike the Black Heart, they are far less well‐known beyond that. Membership is by invitation only. The information was, uh, literally just released to me.*

The last sentence was meant as an apology for not filling in the information for her in time.

\"The evidence we have is fragmentary at best,\" Kana said, \"but I had considerable suspicion regarding the circumstances surrounding the most recent power failures. The Seers I was able to point at the problem are convinced that the most recent events are certainly the work of whoever is responsible for your genetic modifications. They are also convinced that we must tell you now, or risk never finding out any further information.\"

\"There is other information,\" Ryouko\'s aunt interjected, \"though much less certain. These kinds of divinations are often much more clouded than we\'d like. Some of the Seers claim that they don\'t believe this group is trying to kill you. One is even convinced that this group isn\'t trying to stop us at all, just trying to arrange events in their favor. It\'s a very controversial reading, since no one else can sense that result.\"

\"It\'s incomplete information,\" Kana said, looking at Nana almost reproachfully. \"It\'s not worth sharing unless we\'re sure.\"

*Many members of the Far Seers are also members of the Church,* Patricia thought, without a visible change in expression. *There often seems to be little rhyme or reason to what can or cannot be divined, except that sometimes the usefulness of the information we can acquire seems... beyond coincidence.*

Ryouko looked down at her hands, struck all at once by the surrealness of the conversation. It was a matter that should have been personal to her, but involved big players, a matter that seemed like it could reshape her life, yet, objectively, what exactly was she going to do differently now?

\"So what exactly am I supposed to do now?\" she asked. \"Go to a lab for study? Let myself be experimented on? What else?\"

\"No,\" Kana said, leaning over and grabbing her. \"We will, of course, want to do further study, but there is no reason you can\'t live your life. The Seers were sure of that one. Don\'t---\"

She paused, clearly considering what to say.

\"Don\'t let yourself be defined by this,\" she finished. \"You are too young to know very much about this, but there were entire populations after the Unification Wars with worse modifications than what you have, and they went on to live perfectly normal lives. Many of them are all around us. Once we know what exactly has been done to you, if anything needs to be changed, it will be done. But if the Seers are sure you\'ll be fine, no one is going to lock you up in a lab.\"

\"And my parents?\" Ryouko asked, shaking her head wearily as she tried to think through what had been said.

\"For now you shouldn\'t tell them anything,\" Kana said. \"I know that might be a lot to ask, but we just don\'t know anything yet.\"

Ryouko let out a breath.

What was she supposed to think? Who could she even trust? Kana and the others assembled here had no reason to lie to her, but she had thought the same of her parents, and of so many others, only to be disillusioned time and time again. And now she had to question whether she was even human, who exactly had plans for her, and, whether Kana admitted it or not, whether her thoughts were even her own.

\"Can I be alone for a while?\" she began.

\"Certainly,\" Kana said. \"We can leave you, though I might want my office back.\"

\"No, I mean, is there anywhere in Paris that might be good to just be alone for a long while? Maybe a park or something?\"

The others shared a look.

\"I have my own room in the Nunnery of St. Barbara,\" Nana said. \"I can take you there, but I\'m not sure now is the time to make the trip.\"

\"Give me the coordinates. I can make the trip faster than that.\"

She heard Patricia suck in a breath.

\"For safety reasons, I don\'t think we\'d really want you to travel alone.\"

\"Well, I was going to take Asami.\"

Though her words were uncertain, her demeanor wasn\'t. The others started to look at each other again, perhaps even holding a telepathic conversation, but Ryouko got up and walked out of the room, and they made no move to stop her.

The others, still waiting in the conference room, looked up in surprise as she entered, but she ignored them, grabbing Asami by the shoulders.

\"Is everything alright?\" Asami asked, shaking off the shock of an unexpected teleport with startling efficiency, even as she peered around at the dimly lit walls. Clarisse stood ever‐present in the back of her mind, with clearly much to say---but she knew to stay quiet.

Ryouko leaned forward and wept.

> The telepathic arts, as practiced by the Telepaths\' Guild, have always been a bit of an oddball among the various classes of magic. Lacking much of the direct flashiness of so many other magic types, telepathy has instead developed along a more esoteric, inwardly‐focused route, full of secret manipulations, meditation, and invisible attacks. This aesthetic extends even to the customs of the Guild, which eschew flashy decoration and events in favor of simple rituals, and to the cultural nonchalance of the Guild towards "routine\" mind‐reading, which is conducted as a matter of unremarkable course.

By far the most common is the appearance of a colored magic glow when using telepathic powers. Less common, but still relatively prevalent, is the use of telepathic powers to deal direct damage, usually in the form of brain aneurysms or neural trauma. Finally, a relatively rare type of mage flaunts the convention entirely, drawing upon the historical association of mental manipulation with darkness and corruption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami frowned, floating in deep space as she tried to focus on the spectacle playing out below her. She usually found the strategic view of Command Mode relaxing, but now she was tired, frustrated, and swore she had a headache.

She found herself spending more and more time nowadays in this kind of simulation, plugged into Zhukov while seated in her command chair. The purpose wasn\'t combat or direct command, but large‐scale strategy, and beating her head against the conclusions of Governance\'s top AIs, trying to find another way.

It felt a little like being Sisyphus, gazing down on another long‐term war simulation that ended in Humanity\'s inevitable defeat, Governance\'s long‐range emergency colony ships darting off to distant corners of the galaxy. From a straightforward logistical standpoint the conclusion was inescapable---eventually one of the Cephalopod offenses would succeed, and Humanity didn\'t have the reserves necessary to turn the war back around.

And that wasn\'t even bringing up the more disturbing aspects of Governance thought, the nagging models that couldn\'t rectify Cephalopod performance in the war with any of the most likely models of their society. The squid should have easily had the personnel and industrial production to run right over them, but just *didn\'t*. Were they an insular species that disliked expansion? Was this a minor splinter cell that didn\'t represent the main population group? Were they really primitives hand‐fed technology by yet another race? It was impossible to know.

Governance military policy was dictated primarily by these considerations. They were playing a dangerous game, betting that they could stave off the current alien incursions with a carefully tuned investment of military resources, while pouring everything else into industrial‐economic expansion and scientific research and development. The more they could grow and develop, the longer the war would stretch out, and the greater the chance that a sudden breakthrough or reversal, especially* driven by a magical girl, would abruptly change the game.

*It\'s not good enough,* Mami thought. *I won\'t accept a game like that.*

There was the possibility, after all, that given enough time the squid would learn dangerous aspects of the magical girl system. There were new reports of alien personnel combing battlefields for invisible objects, in search patterns that suggested they were looking for some kind of magical girl equipment or power source. Mami simply did not *like* it.

They needed some kind of plan, some kind of trump card in their back pocket they could play in case things went sideways---something which was starting to seem increasingly likely.

*Perhaps it\'s time you took a break,* Machina thought. *You\'re starting to mix your metaphors.*

It wasn\'t the first time her TacComp had made the suggestion, but this time Mami rubbed her head and acceded. Even if Machina seemed a bit more assertive lately, that didn\'t mean it was wrong.

*You\'re right,* she thought. *I\'ve been here too long.*

She closed her virtual eyes, allowing herself a bit of rest as she felt the simulation release her. How long had she been in there? Hours, at least. Realtime.

*About three hours, realtime,* Machina thought. *You can\'t keep doing this to yourself.*

*It\'s not that much,* Mami thought, bothered by a sense of disapproval she suddenly felt. *The others spend much longer than that.*

*Yes, but it seems to affect you more somehow,* Machina thought. *The others don\'t find it as stressful.*

*It\'s probably the material,* Mami thought, opening her eyes and looking around Zhukov\'s bridge. *The others mostly just think about how to run their sectors, or what kind of attacks they might face. I have to spend my time looking into the most depressing long‐run projections.*

*If you say so.*

Mami pushed herself up and out of the chair, feeling the snake‐like spinal connection cable detach itself smoothly. She had thought exiting the simulation might improve her headache, but it only seemed to be getting *worse*.

*It\'s definitely not normal,* Machina thought. *You\'re not supposed to be able to even have headaches, but something is definitely toggling the pain receptors. I could block it, but it\'s probably better for you to get a diagnostic done. All the self‐diagnostics are coming up clean.*

*You\'re not wrong; there just hasn\'t been time,* Mami thought, a bit uneasily. She wasn\'t used to Machina, or anyone, showing this much concern for her. She was used to being *senpai*, after all.

*Well, I was made with your genes, of course,* Machina thought.

\"Good evening, Mami‐san,\" a voice nearby said.

Mami snapped out of her reverie, finding herself in the hallway heading back to her office. The woman who had addressed her stood there, smiling back, dressed as always in far fewer clothes than Mami found sensible.

*Charlotte Meitner,* Mami thought, sighing to herself.

Mami wasn\'t very fond of her MHD Minder---it was difficult to like anyone who spent her time prying into your mind---but Mami knew better than to be a child about it, like Kyouko was. It was her job, after all, to monitor the senior magical girl officers on board Zhukov, even if they generally returned the favor by staying as far away as possible.

Mami\'s bodyguards, meanwhile, had managed to conveniently disappear, following protocol near a Minder. She wished she could just tell them not to.

Still, she straightened her back and managed to conceal her unease, returning to her usual, pleasant demeanor.

\"Good evening,\" she said. \"What brings me the pleasure of having you here?\"

*That was a little stiff,* Machina commented. Her TacComp really *was being more talkative these days.

\"Well, I couldn\'t help but notice you seem to be having a bit of trouble recently,\" Charlotte said, a telepath like all the others. \"I know you\'re busy, but you definitely seem to be taking more stress than is healthy. I was thinking we could schedule a session to talk about it.\"

Mami opened her mouth to say something, but felt an abrupt sharp pain in her head, sharp enough that she couldn\'t avoid visibly wincing. The throbbing in her head seemed to double in intensity.

\"You have a headache?\" Charlotte asked, tilting her head. \"That\'s not normal.\"

\"It\'s alright,\" Mami insisted, even as the headache worsened. \"I\'m going to get it checked out.\"

She meant it, too. At this point she was on the verge of summoning the medical staff to her, rather than trying to get there on her own power.

\"I know I\'ve been very very busy recently,\" she managed to say. \"But I\'ve been through worse. I\'m just a little tired.\"

\"I wouldn\'t say that,\" Charlotte said, frowning deeply. \"You feel exhausted, more than you should be.\"

The last thing she wanted to do was talk to anyone about the dreams, Mami thought.

She instantly regretted that thought, though, since obviously she was broadcasting it directly to the telepath in front of her.

\"The what?\" Charlotte echoed out loud, holding a hand to *her* head. She seemed confused, even perplexed, even as another sharp pain stabbed at Mami\'s head.

She bent over slightly.

*Okay, I\'m definitely summoning the medical staff,* Machina thought, a distinct note of worry permeating its thoughts.

And yet, even as it did, the pain abruptly lifted from Mami\'s head, and she was even able to let out a sigh of relief, though she felt a lingering dizziness remain.

She looked up, resolving to use some magic on herself to alleviate the issue, before noticing that Charlotte looked different.

Young, much younger, and... raven‐haired? It struck her immediately that she looked beautiful, and a strange ache developed in her chest.

Then, with an almost palpable snap, reality flooded back in, and she found herself looking at Charlotte again, who had both hands on her head this time and looked like *she* was in agony.

\"Miss Meitner!\" Mami managed, before the woman in front of her collapsed on the spot. Mami barely managed to catch her in time, deliberately falling to the floor as she did so.

A spider‐like medical drone scurried out of a nearby transport tube a moment later, the advance guard of the medical team that was on its way. Its one eye looked at Mami, then at Charlotte, and made the logical decision to crawl onto Charlotte and start scanning *her*, rather than who it had been summoned to attend to. A series of mechanical arms and tubing reached out, interfacing with her spinal node, and contacting the skin.

Zhukov\'s avatar flashed into existence shortly afterward, looming over the three of them.

\"What is going on?\" he asked. \"Do you have any idea what this is about? Is she alright?\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Mami said, channeling healing magic into her hands. "But I think she\'ll be alright.\"

She was no Yuma at healing, but she had a few tricks up her sleeve.

She closed her eyes, letting her thoughts settle, just as Yuma herself had taught her to, once long ago. It was easier to heal magical girls than anything else, because their own magic would be trying to do the same thing, and would eagerly accept the help and the synergy. She just had to reach out...

\"Spontaneous massive cerebral hemorrhage,\" the drone concluded a moment later, voice oddly soothing in that way medical drones somehow had. \"Non‐vital region, but ordinarily a near‐certain chance of irrecoverable data loss. Subject magical girl, however---damage should not be a concern. Recommend stabilization and self‐healing, or---\"

It looked up expectantly at Mami, who had already opened her eyes again.

\"I\'ve taken care of it,\" she said.

\"Source of damage unknown,\" drone continued, looking down and deploying more instruments. \"Resembles focused blast damage. Does not make sense given surveillance recordings...\"

The drone continued to mutter to itself even as Charlotte awoke, jerking away from both Mami and drone in surprise. The drone stayed attached with little difficulty, but Mami found herself looking Charlotte in the eyes.

\"Do you have any idea what you just did?\" Charlotte demanded, wide‐eyed with shock.

\"Heal you?\" Mami asked.

Charlotte sucked in a breath, clearly working to steady herself.

\"Nevermind,\" she said, looking away. \"We\'ll talk about it later.\"

The rest of the medical team appeared in the corridor, deploying themselves professionally around Charlotte without any evidence of surprise at the change in patients.

\"What are you talking about?\" Mami asked, even as Charlotte gamely lay back down for examination. \"Do you know what just happened?\"

Charlotte shook her head, regaining her usual demeanor.

\"Just make sure to get your diagnostic. Later.\"

\"After that, you should probably take a break,\" Zhukov commented, looking bemused as he surveyed the scene. \"You have a meeting with the Staff in two hours.\"

Questions swirled in Mami\'s mind, but still, she only barely managed to resist sighing.

\"I know,\" she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko had forgotten what it was like to be in deep space.

The cold stars that surrounded them soothed her, a piece of the seemingly eternal in a world where nothing was ever certain. For a long moment, she could even forget the nagging voice in her head, the one that pointed out that those stars weren\'t eternal either, though if the Incubators were to be believed, they themselves were keeping the fires of existence lit.

*You\'re doing it again,* Clarisse thought.

*I know,* she thought, resenting briefly her TacComp\'s intrusion.

The moment broken, she brooded quietly with her head on her hands, staring out their shuttle\'s side‐viewing panel. She and Asami were seated alone in a tiny Skipper shuttle, a smaller cousin of the much more common Navigator. It only carried four people at most, with a simple A to B guidance system.

More importantly for their purposes, it was simple enough for a team of Science Division technicians to do a thorough manual code analysis. Ryouko\'s distant guardians had gotten sharply more paranoid in recent weeks, enough to attach Patricia von Rohr to her bodyguard team, as a specialist in detecting magical and technological manipulation.

It was, to put it simply, a massive headache, one stacked on top of the repeated brain scans she had undergone, and the need to keep everything secret from her mother and the surprisingly perceptive Sacnite. Waving goodbye to them at the starport had been almost a relief.

Now she was riding out to the laboratory Adept Blue in the depths of space, at the express invitation of Tomoe Mami herself. Her stay on Earth had been short, as she was starting to think it always would be.

\"It will be alright,\" Asami said, touching her hand and wearing that worried look she had so often nowadays. Ryouko knew that it was not easy for her, so close to the void again after her previous experiences there.

She appreciated that.

Ryouko smiled slightly, even as they both knew Asami had no way to really say that with certainty. Whoever it was that had designed the module in Ryouko\'s brain had not intended its secrets to be uncovered easily---something inside it was obfuscating the scans somehow, interfering even with nanite‐based probing, and obviously performing surgery for direct inspection was out of the question. Even now, analysis of what results they could get was still ongoing, but the last time she had asked Patricia about the matter, the only answer she had gotten was \"frustrating\".

Even magical probing attempts had somehow bounced right off, something that only added another angle to their speculations. Clarisse was gamely trying to investigate it herself, in the hopes that continuous effort would somehow succeed even with limited tools. Thus far, she had done no better than any of the others.

The unsettling implications were obvious to everyone, and they couldn\'t even deduce whether the magic blocking the probing was foreign or Ryouko\'s own---a possibility that had to be considered, since the body she was in was effectively almost brand‐new. Ryouko had assumed that she would always be able to recognize her own magic, but that apparently wasn\'t the case.

Ryouko looked into Asami\'s eyes. There was some analogy between her situation with her parents and Asami\'s own situation, but they had yet to talk about it.

\"*Hey over there! We can see you!*\"

Ryouko and Asami both looked over, startled out of what had been a period of mutual contemplation. The chirpy voice was that of Shizuki Elanis, one of Ryouko\'s bodyguards, and for a few seconds Ryouko searched the starry sky, tracing the transmitted audio to its source. Even with her enhanced vision, it was challenging, and she spotted several distant asteroids before she finally spotted one of their companion Skippers, a lot closer than she thought it would be---the emission‐reducing material used on most human ships nowadays made them nearly invisible in deep space.

They had separated from the other Skippers at the beginning of their trip for security reasons, so to be so close again implied that they were approaching their destination, floating somewhere in Sol\'s asteroid belt.

\"*It\'s so beautiful up here!*\" Eri added a moment later. \"*I\'m so glad I had the chance to come with you!*\"

Ryouko and Asami looked at each other, Asami barely suppressing a laugh. Somehow, Kuroi Eri and Shizuki Elanis were still traveling with them, when it seemed natural they would have been replaced a long time ago.

Ryouko turned her head to peer in front of their craft. In principle, she could use the trajectories of both their Skippers to help infer where they were headed, but in practice that was extremely difficult to do accurately in three dimensions, without landmarks, in the depths of space.

Even with implant support, it turned out that the uncertainty margin was so wide Ryouko would have done just as well assuming it was directly in front of them. That was, after all, not that bad a guess---but she still couldn\'t find anything.

\"Over there,\" Asami said, pointing slightly to the right.

Ryouko squinted instinctively where Asami was pointing.

\"I don\'t see anything,\" she concluded, after a moment.

\"I\'m sure it\'s there.\"

Ryouko wondered how Asami was so certain.

\"I spent time fighting in space, geez,\" Asami said, looking at Ryouko out of the corner of her eye. \"I\'ve gotten good at sensing this sort of thing. And, you know, wherever it is we\'re going feels very odd. Something off with the gravity. It can\'t be *that* heavy.\"

\"That makes sense,\" Ryouko said. \"You know, all things considered.\"

\"You\'re acting like you know everything again,\" Asami grumbled.

Ryouko shrugged vaguely. Asami subsided for a moment, then leaned over, suggestively close.

\"Say, I wonder what they think we\'ve been doing in here, just the two of us. These Skippers probably don\'t monitor their passengers, and, you know, you just don\'t get terribly many opportunities to try anything in zero‐gravity. We would just have to remove these straps.\"

\"They can assume what they want.\"

\"Might as well fulfill their expectations, I say.\"

Ryouko looked sideways at Asami, trying to gauge how serious she was being. There was mischievousness in her eyes, but the girl hadn\'t made any clear moves, and didn\'t have that disturbingly predatory look in her eyes.

Asami was just joking, then.

Ryouko shook her head.

\"They might be able to see us from here. Are you sure the gravity isn\'t making you drunk?\"

\"That stopped happening when I was in the *MC*!\" Asami said, biting her lip in annoyance. \"Besides, it\'s not like anything gets that well‐hidden with how crowded it is on Earth. You wouldn\'t believe what you can see in infrared!\"

\"I don\'t believe that,\" Ryouko said. \"I\'ve tried it.\"

\"Oh, so you *have* tried it! How unexpectedly risqué!\"

Ryouko closed her eyes for an exasperated moment, then gave Asami a look.

\"Thanks for trying to cheer me up,\" she said.

Asami sighed, looking out the window again.

\"Well, someone has to,\" she said. \"Here we are, way out here again, just as we were starting to settle in again. You can\'t be happy with the way they pulled us out here.\"

Ryouko noticed Asami\'s careful wording, but said nothing, preferring to follow Asami\'s gaze into the depths of space. She heard Asami let out a small breath.

\"Oh, interesting,\" Asami said, dropping the topic. \"What *are* they doing over there?\"

Ryouko still didn\'t see anything, but now...

But now she felt her eyes drawn there too, as if there *must* be something there.

\"Ryouko,\" Asami interrupted, grasping her hand and raising it.

Ryouko interpreted it as an unexpected intimate gesture, and almost responded as if it were, but then saw what Asami was trying to show her.

\"It\'s glowing a little,\" Asami said.

\"Yes,\" Ryouko finally agreed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gravitonics lab Adept Blue wasn\'t exactly top‐secret. Its existence was perfectly well‐registered in the appropriate public databases, its membership was available in all the proper places, and the topic of its research was freely, if vaguely, disclosed. It even published results at a fairly reasonable pace, participating in the broad network of tracking and transparency that typified modern research. At the same time, though, it seemed to stay deliberately off the radar, with no media, no splashy announcements, no touted visits from Governance officials, and effectively no PR presence.

On top of all of that, Clarisse had found, the lab\'s exact location was almost a complete mystery. Other than the general acknowledgment that the lab was located within a body somewhere in Sol\'s asteroid belt, there was effectively no useful information as to how to get to the lab. The ID of the asteroid the lab used was not listed, there was no information about how its personnel got into or out of the lab, and, most importantly, the station was not included in the navigation databases starships used to keep track of the ever‐shifting locations of humanity\'s outposts in space.

It seemed par for the course, then, that the asteroid their Skipper flew towards appeared nondescript to the eye, even in infrared. It was by all appearances a completely normal kilometer‐sized space rock, and for a few minutes Ryouko even began to entertain the possibility that they would land on its surface, before a well‐concealed attachment port seemed to pop into existence directly below them, with just the slightest afterimage of the illusion that had once been there.

When they stepped out of the airlock, they found themselves looking down the corridors of a completely standard‐looking research lab---indeed, much more normal than the stone decorations of ITG back on Eurydome. Nothing was out of place, except her two awed‐looking chief bodyguards, accompanied by what was evidently the avatar of a lab AI, considering the \"man\" that appeared to stand there was the spitting image of Vladimir Volokhov.

\"Welcome to Adept Blue,\" the AI said, turning away from Patricia to address them. \"To say that we have been looking forward to seeing you would be... a decided understatement. But I\'m getting ahead of myself. There\'s no need to be in a rush. I am Vladimir Volokhov, or, as my friends call me, Vlad.\"

The girls traded a look after the enigmatic statement, but followed as Vlad led them down the hallway. As they walked, Ryouko tried to catch a look of what was going on behind some of the open doors, finding mostly researchers seated at their desks frowning at holographic screens and floating models.

\"I gather I do not have to spend too much time explaining the work that is done here, given the time you two have spent at ITG,\" Vlad said, seeming to forget the presence of Elanis, Eri, and Patricia. \"I am indebted to Lemaître and Dr. Tao for their hard work on this matter. It is sad that they cannot know more about the true state of things, but they will get their share of the credit, in due time.\"

\"You seem to be talking about something very specific,\" Patricia said, asking the question that Ryouko had been about to. \"What do you mean?\"

Vlad shrugged.

\"Not yet. We can talk about it over dinner. I apologize if I seem like a tease, but I\'ve never been one for any conversation that isn\'t about work.\"

From the corner of her eye, Ryouko watched their luggage drones turn and disappear down a side corridor. Their itinerary had called for dinner with the lab director, followed by some time to rest in their new rooms. It hadn\'t specified beyond that.

She could tell on her newly downloaded map of the facility that they were within the living quarters, and she could only assume that they would be eating there. She couldn\'t find the director\'s room on the map, though, and the names of the occupants didn\'t otherwise seem to be listed.

*Who* is *the director, anyway?* she thought, directing the question at Clarisse. She couldn\'t remember if the name had even been in the public information.

*Unlisted,* Clarisse replied. *Though, with the way this is going, I wonder if* Vlad *here is the lab director. That would make a certain amount of sense. He doesn\'t seem good at introductions.*

Ryouko felt embarrassed that the possibility hadn\'t even occurred to her.

A moment later, Vlad led them through a doorway and into someone\'s private living area, where a dining table had already been prominently set, constructed out of the same kind of self‐assembling modular furniture that was so prevalent on Earth. Chopsticks and teacups helped form what appeared to be a Japanese, or at least Asian, table setting. The table had been set for six, though there was a gap in the arrangement that was suggestive of a missing seventh seat.

\"Naturally, I do not eat,\" Vlad said, almost apologetically, as he took a seat in the gap, a holographic chair materializing below him. "But, feel free to take your seats. I am told Mami‐san is going to be a little late. She is understandably quite busy.\"

Given that there was now only one seat left, Ryouko could only assume it was for Mami, implying that Vlad really *was* the lab director. Clarisse had been right after all. They sat, Kuroi Eri peering into the teapot before politely pouring some out for the guests. It was odd that her two bodyguards had been invited to the dinner, or that they had been instructed to socialize with Ryouko so directly, but the once‐large team of professionals was now shrunk to only a half‐dozen individuals, including the two leaders. It simply wasn\'t practical to deploy so many specialists in planet‐side protection to a completely new environment, and Adept Blue wouldn\'t have had an easy job accommodating such a large security detail anyway.

Ryouko sipped her green tea, luxuriating for the moment in its warmth and flavor. She wondered if it was synthesized.

\"*I do apologize for not giving Clarisse her due welcome,*\" Vlad messaged. \"*But I was told that the field marshal would not respond well, and who am I to question that?*\"

Ryouko wrinkled her brow, then stopped herself, hoping that no one else had seen her react.

As she did so, her implants registered that the last guest was about to arrive at the door. Only then did she realize, despite all the obvious hints she had already seen, that Mami *wasn\'t* going to be here virtually. She was *actually* here, which explained why there was a table setting laid out for her, and possibly why Ryouko and Asami had flown out all this way. It was obvious in retrospect.

Elanis and Eri looked abruptly shocked, though, and Elanis\'s hair flailed wildly before settling into a new, more formal hairstyle. Somehow, they had made the same mistake.

The woman herself arrived a moment later, pausing in the doorway to look around and acknowledge Vlad\'s greeting. Ryouko caught the barest glimpse of Karina and Xiao Long stationing themselves outside the door; it seemed cruel to have them stand outside while they ate.

\"Field Marshal,\" Vlad greeted.

\"Director Volokhov,\" Mami echoed.

As Mami sat down, server drones began emerging from the back room with trays of food mounted on top, indicating clearly that the dinner was underway. It looked like the starter course was soup and pickled vegetables.

\"It\'s an honor to have you here,\" Eri said, making haste to pour Mami some of the tea. \"We hadn\'t been expecting you to be here in, you know, person.\"

Elanis laughed nervously.

\"It is a bit bad of me,\" Mami said, stirring a bowl of miso soup. "True, I don\'t actually have to be on a ship to necessarily command, but Zhukov\'s interface is better than anyone\'s. But I have my own reasons for being hard to find at the moment. You have no idea how hard it was to get away.\"

Ryouko made eye contact with Asami and Patricia in turn. She had no idea who Mami was talking to.

\"Oh, I just wanted to hear myself talk,\" Mami said, seeming to answer Ryouko\'s question. \"Anyway, before we get down to real business, you should do yourself a favor and try some of Vlad\'s tempura. He makes it himself, you know, with drones and a fryer. I have no idea how he does it, without taste buds and all.\"

\"You flatter me,\" Vlad said, ducking his head in faux humility. "It\'s mostly a matter of temperature control and timing, after all.\"

The promised tempura arrived just moments later, piping hot, and they settled down to eating, though Ryouko had difficulty enjoying the carefully managed texture under a sudden wave of unease emanating from Clarisse.

*What\'s wrong?* she thought.

*I\'ll tell you later,* Clarisse thought. *Nothing you need to worry about yet.*

\"I suppose I will warm us up with an introduction to what you need to know about Adept Blue and its facilities,\" Vlad said, as the others took in their food. \"I trust you will all be capable of paying attention despite the food.\"

\"Oh, I\'m not sure about that,\" Patricia quipped, though she was nearly done with her dish.

Director Volokhov accepted the compliment with a smile.

\"I must preface that what I say here is strictly confidential,\" he said. \"You may refer to the information I am about to send you for a detailed explanation of the classification level, but rest assured that none of it will be below Level Three.\"

Shizuki Elanis made a noise, looking at Eri, then at Mami and the others.

\"You\'re fine,\" Mami said, smiling. \"You\'re allowed to hear this. We\'ll explain in a moment.\"

Elanis and Eri shared an obvious worried look, but subsided.

\"I\'m sure it will surprise none of you at this point that Adept Blue is a bit more than it appears on the surface,\" Vlad said. \"Not to put too fine a point on it, we are the most visible of a network of secret research labs dedicated to sensitive Governance research.\"

He looked around to make sure they understood, then continued, leaning forward and clasping his hands:

\"For various purposes, Governance prefers to have some technologies it keeps to itself, at least on a temporary basis, even if they involve nothing that would particularly outrage the public. This gives Governance enough time to study the potential societal implications of a given technology, and also allows for the development of countermeasures to technologies that may interfere with aspects of Governance surveillance or operations if distributed widely.\"

It was a lot to digest, though Vlad said it almost matter‐of‐factly, and only Patricia and Mami nodded along in time, the rest blank‐faced. Nonetheless, Vlad continued:

\"It is of course no secret that Governance would love to duplicate as much of Cephalopod technology as possible, if only to understand how it works. However, work on replication of their wormhole and stealth technology has been kept proprietary, in the first case because of its potential to drastically reshape the economy and society, and in the second because of the implications of potential stealth we do not yet have countermeasures for. X‐25 amply demonstrates the wisdom of censoring the latter.\"

Ryouko cast a glance at Eri and Elanis, who shouldn\'t have known anything about what had happened. As expected, they looked puzzled.

\"In any case, we are the primary lab engaged in these two endeavors, because of what we have found to be their inherent similarity,\" Vlad said. \"In this case, our goals aren\'t all that secret, since pretty much every currently‐operating gravitonics lab is working toward the same goals. What *is* secret is how much progress we\'ve made, though it\'s still not as much as I\'d like. Oh, but look at me talking over the food presentation.\"

He stopped talking as the server drones reappeared with fresh trays, preceded by the intoxicating aroma of grilled food. The drones were deft, handling plates piled hedonistically high with grilled shellfish, vegetables, and meat.

Even with her mind filled with speculation on the point of this elaborate meeting, Ryouko found herself abruptly aware of just how long she had spent in transit with nothing to eat. From the looks of the others at the table, her sentiment was hardly unique, despite the tempura and soup that should have dampened their ardor.

For a couple of minutes there was silence, not counting the tapping of chopsticks, rattling of dishes, and chewing of food. The only ones not eating ravenously were Mami, who was being demure, and of course Director Volokhov.

\"Girls these days,\" Mami said, with an air of affected nostalgia. \"I remember when everyone here would be holding back for the sake of their appearance.\"

\"It\'s probably for the best that those times are behind us,\" Vlad said.

*I don\'t even know what they\'re talking about,* Asami thought, biting into a grilled king mushroom.

*It\'s not important,* Ryouko thought.

Despite the presence of the food, Ryouko found she couldn\'t entirely push the topic of conversation out of her mind. It didn\'t take a Governance AI to deduce that the combination of top‐secret gravitonics lab, wormhole research, her, and the need for Asami to be there, was highly significant.

\"I heard about that from Auntie Shizuki,\" Elanis said, not‐so‐daintily scarfing down a piece of meat while talking. \"It sounds awful.\"

Mami smiled slightly.

\"It never really mattered. You could always use magic to slim down a little if you really had to. It was only a problem in the early days, when you had to conserve on that.\"

Mami focused on her eating for a moment, nibbling delicately into a mushroom. Ryouko could tell her heart wasn\'t really on the food.

Finally, after they had all spent a polite interval eating, Mami looked around the table, catching each of their eyes in turn.

Ryouko watched her set chopsticks down on the table in decisive fashion. There was an abrupt lull in the table\'s eating motions, as everyone felt the mood shift.

\"Well, it is probably time for me to talk about why I brought you all here,\" Mami said. \"As I have been implying, it wasn\'t just to chat, or else I could have just sent a hologram to you on Earth. There is a very good reason for me to order you here.\"

She paused, and Ryouko had time to reflect that, indeed, she and Asami had been ordered here rather than asked, though she hadn\'t thought anything of it at the time, so eager had she been to leave Earth behind.

Ryouko felt Mami watching her carefully.

\"I understand that there have been disturbing facts that have emerged about your heritage. I haven\'t had the opportunity to really talk to you about that, which is bad of me as a mentor, but I am sure Kyouko has had a chance to?\"

Ryouko cast her mind back, remembering what seemed like an eternity ago.

\"She told me that I am who I am, and I shouldn\'t worry about whatever is in my head because my magic will counter it if it tries to do anything nasty.\"

Mami nodded, as the clatter of eating cautiously resumed, the others realizing that they weren\'t being asked to speak, though they still watched the two of them carefully.

\"That is the right thing to say. I\'ve been occupied with other aspects of the problem, so I might have seemed a little distant.\"

She paused.

\"Still, it\'s probably for the best for you to get a change of perspective for a while,\" she said. \"We also think it best to move you to a more secure environment than the crowds of Earth. That is why it was fortuitous for Director Volokhov to contact me.\"

\"Excuse me, but who is \'we\' here?\" Ryouko asked. \"You and Kyouko?\"

Even as Eri and Elanis looked at Ryouko in mild shock, Mami ducked her head to sip some of her tea, perhaps to buy some time to compose a better response.

\"Roughly,\" she said. \"I would be lying if I said that it was just the two of us. As you\'ll see when I explain, there are legitimate reasons for other parties to be interested in all this. It\'s not just meddling.\"

Ryouko considered what she said. There were legitimate reasons, of course, even if she didn\'t like thinking about them. With the revelation of the module in her head, it would have been remiss of the responsible parties to *not* monitor her. Indeed, she was being treated well to still have freedom of action---even if it now occurred to her that there were good security reasons to not have her near anything critical on Earth.

However, it sounded like Mami was talking about something else entirely.

She nodded slightly, and Mami smiled.

\"Well, the real meat of the situation is: Director Volokhov has informed me that Adept Blue has been analyzing the results of the experiments with you at ITG before the unfortunate incident. On their own, they are interesting, but not necessarily that useful. Adept Blue, however, had another idea. Director?\"

The AI made a show of clearing its throat.

\"Please, though,\" he said. \"You\'ve barely eaten, Shizuki‐san. Take a moment.\"

Feeling very awkward, Ryouko reached out for a few pieces of calamari and beef. She didn\'t know how exactly she was supposed to eat like this, with the eyes of the table all covertly on her, but she managed to chew through it methodically, even enjoying it a little.

\"Alright,\" Vlad said. \"I\'ll relieve the suspense, if you\'ll excuse my renewed interruption of your eating...\"

The air above the table flickered briefly, before congealing into a blue and red blob that Ryouko initially had difficulty interpreting. There appeared to be a large sphere embedded into the middle of the object, but---

*Oh it\'s the moon of Orpheus,* Ryouko finally realized.

The others seemed less enlightened, however, and after a moment Vlad continued:

\"This is a large‐scale representation of the wormhole at Orpheus in the brief moments where it was reopened by Miss Shizuki here. The focused attention of the fleet\'s sensors on the area has provided us with a wealth of information we had not previously been able to obtain. Being able to observe a wormhole *opening* has been particularly helpful. We had some previous telemetry from the Saharan Raid, but oddly enough, the military doesn\'t spend as long as we\'d like taking measurements.\"

He said the last sentence without a trace of irony, leaving Ryouko wondering how seriously he meant it.

\"Based on what we saw, we were able to significantly refine some of our models, and even take a guess at some empirical rules, but there wasn\'t much room for additional progress without a theoretical breakthrough, until, of course, the most interesting teleporter in existence agreed to participate in a few experiments.\"

He smiled at Ryouko, expression acknowledging the blatant piece of flattery. The hologram over the table morphed smoothly into what was clearly a simulation of a wormhole opening and closing.

\"As a result, we were able to verify a few of our theories and clarify our thinking,\" he said. \"Since then, we have been hard at work trying to apply what we have learned, to replicate at least some aspects of the effect. We have had some encouraging results, but not as much as we\'d like.\"

He closed his eyes again, and Ryouko wondered if it was primarily for effect, since if she recalled correctly AIs mostly considered human conversations too slow for their taste.

Ryouko took the opportunity to look around at the others. Vlad\'s presentation was clearly going to be long enough that they had slowed in their eating, preferring to pay attention to what was being presented. Patricia and Asami had the thoughtful look she associated with someone trying to pay close attention to something far outside of their field of specialty, a look she probably shared. Elanis and Eri wore blank looks that indicated they had lost track of the conversation, and were perhaps trying to follow a time‐delayed version on their implants. Mami she could not read---she appeared to have a smile frozen on her face, one that Ryouko couldn\'t help but find something unsettling in.

\"The amount of power involved in performing these kinds of manipulations of space‐time is prodigious,\" Vlad said finally, steepling his hands. \"We have simply not been able to generate the energies necessary to replicate even the distortions seen in relatively minor Cephalopod gravitonic technologies. Until the stealth device was discovered on X‐25, we had believed that we had run into a fundamental limit of the technology, and that only successfully replicating the power source of a paradox drive would generate sufficient power on anything remotely portable enough.\"

The diagram that now appeared above the table had little meaning to Ryouko at a quick glance, and was likely more for decoration than explanation.

\"The energy costs of generating a controlled wormhole are orders of magnitude more enormous,\" Vlad said, a distant look in his eyes. "Indeed, we suspect that the wormholes the Cephalopods use are sized to optimize this energy cost, managing a trade‐off between the energy necessary to open something so large, and the sheer instability of smaller wormholes. Ironically it is not nearly as difficult to keep a wormhole open once it *is* open, but with our current resources we simply could not do either.\"

Ryouko could feel Mami\'s gaze resting on her as Vlad spoke, and wondered what exactly her reaction should be.

She pulled herself up in her seat, even as Asami put down a piece of chicken she had just picked up, apparently deciding against eating it for now.

\"So you want Asami and I to stay here for further study?\" Ryouko said, drawing the obvious conclusion. \"I can see how that\'d make sense. We could stay here away from Earth until whatever needs to be solved has been solved, and we can also help you with your research. This is obviously a bit of a secure location.\"

For the first time since earlier in the conversation, Vlad smiled slightly, focusing his attention back on Ryouko.

\"That\'s not a bad guess,\" he said. \"Though I suppose the evidence was all around you. You are mostly right. That *is* the general reason you are here. However, if it were just a matter of further testing and experimentation, it would hardly have been a matter that could have brought the Field Marshal out here.\"

Ryouko couldn\'t avoid looking at Mami, who just nodded and gestured with her eyes back towards Vlad.

\"After a long time spent studying the issue,\" Vlad said, expression now serious, \"we have concluded that there *is* a way to achieve the effect we desire, on a transient basis. I am not sure how useful it will be, and it hardly satisfies me intellectually... but I will stop mincing words. Our models are convinced now that a properly constructed apparatus, coupled with a small controlled singularity, could recreate weakly the conditions for wormhole opening, similar to the conditions prevailing near Orpheus after the alien wormhole generator was destroyed. Given that, it is possible that you could replicate the feat of teleportation you achieved there, using the near‐instantaneous wormhole transits with which you perform your teleportation. In other words, we would be able to construct a device that would act as a range amplifier.\"

The sudden onrush of words left Ryouko bemused for a moment, struggling to parse not just the explicit meaning of what he had said, but also the implicit meaning. If they could construct a range extender, then what? To how far? Why did it matter?

The movements of utensils slowed further, as the others realized the same things Ryouko did about what Vlad had said.

Even as Ryouko formulated what she was going to say, though, Patricia spoke up on the topic for the first time.

\"A controlled singularity?\" she asked, blinking deliberately. "That\'s hardly something you can find on a shelf. The last I heard, we weren\'t sure even the Cephalopods had managed to do something like that. That hardly sounds like a step up. Are you saying Adept Blue has managed to make one?\"

\"Well, that\'s something I\'d prefer a technological solution to,\" Vlad said. \"And no, I am not. But at least on a one‐time basis, we have a non‐technological source.\"

He looked meaningfully at Asami, pulling Patricia\'s gaze over as well. A moment later, she nodded.

\"I see. I hadn\'t realized.\"

Asami grabbed Ryouko\'s hand under the table, and squeezed.

\"How much amplification are we talking about?\" Ryouko asked. \"Being able to move a group of people across a star system would definitely be useful, even if I did pass out last time.\"

Vlad smiled again, seemingly amused.

\"We don\'t know,\" he said. \"We\'re not even sure it works. That\'s why we\'d want to try it. But our estimates go as high as several dozen light‐years*. This isn\'t even the same scale. It doesn\'t just match the performance of the Cephalopods---it vastly exceeds it, at least when it comes to blink drives.\"

It took a while for Ryouko to take his latest statement in, blinking back into the hologram\'s eyes while she decided whether and how to respond.

\"To be perfectly honest with you,\" Mami broke in, \"there are those in Governance and the MSY who consider you a security risk after what has been discovered about you, as I think you are smart enough to have predicted yourself. It has not been easy keeping them from acting on their concerns, nor to keep you free and active on Earth. There was no way you could stay and, now, no way potential like this could be ignored.\"

*So it is a prison as well as a lab,* Asami thought bluntly, while keeping her expression still. *We should have realized.*

As much as she would have preferred to, Ryouko couldn\'t ignore the possibility that she was right. She chose to ask a different question, however.

\"So what exactly is the potential of this?\" she asked. \"I can\'t deny there\'s a certain thrill to doing something like this, but what specific value can\'t be ignored? Blowing up alien bases?\"

\"And how would it be possible to assure she would even end up in the right place? Or that she could make it back?\" Patricia asked. \"It\'d be very risky to test.\"

\"There are a lot of unanswered questions,\" Mami said, expression looking almost disappointed. \"There are things we simply won\'t know until they\'re tried. But Humanity needs new weapons in this war. We need to *do* something. The Saharan Raid bought us years, but they\'re too buttoned‐up this time to let us do it a second time. Something must happen*.\"

Ryouko thought she saw Mami clutch the edge of the table, but couldn\'t decide if it was her imagination.

\"So why are *they* here?\" Asami asked, gesturing with her head at Eri and Elanis. \"No offense, but it still doesn\'t make terribly much sense.\"

Mami smiled slightly.

\"No matter how safe this facility is supposed to be, it is difficult to be entirely sure. The two families also thought it would be good for them to build up a little bit of experience, from a situation that doesn\'t just involve more socializing.\"

The explanation didn\'t strike Ryouko as particularly convincing, though she had difficulty reading Mami\'s expression. Patricia made sense---her power set was perfect against potential electronic infiltration---but Eri and Elanis weren\'t specialists in anything in particular.

The two girls in question looked overwhelmed, though, and Ryouko let out a breath, knowing it fell on her to say something.

\"Well, I suppose it will be interesting,\" she said diplomatically, though she meant what she said. \"And I don\'t have any objections to being here for now, as long as there are things to do.\"

\"Well, we couldn\'t bring too many of your friends, for obvious reasons,\" Mami said, cutting at a piece of meat daintily. \"But another reason these girls are here is just to keep us all from getting too lonely.\"

There a pause in the conversation, into which Eri chuckled nervously. Ryouko realized that, for a few minutes, she had completely forgotten they were supposed to be eating.

\"Well, as I worried, you all have barely eaten anything,\" Vlad said, even though Patricia had been quietly mowing through a mound of meat. "Well, I\'m warning you, dessert is on its way, so you better get to eating this embarrassing excess of food.\"

He made a show of clapping his hands, and the server drones reappeared, bearing what appeared to be icy, pink‐red tunnels.

\"Thai rolled ice cream,\" Vlad said, looking satisfied with himself. "Well, really more of a sorbet to be honest. They\'re shaped like wormholes to symbolize our shared interests.\"

They settled in to eating, some of the others hastily stuffing down the grilled meat from earlier. Ryouko managed to follow suit, wondering if Vlad felt he needed to rush the meal, and if so, why?

She was glad nonetheless. Once again, she felt as if she could sympathize with Clarisse van Rossum. She could feel the world shifting under her feet again, and could only wonder where it would take her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami liked to think that she, at least, knew when there was something wrong with her. That was why, rather than try to tough things out on board Zhukov, she had taken a bit of a working vacation, handing over her main duties to Fleet Admiral Anand to embark on this little exploratory excursion.

She had yet to ask Charlotte about the incident earlier, or what she had meant when she demanded to know if Mami knew what she had done. The MHD, Charlotte included, had been very solicitous afterward, asking her---no, demanding* her to come speak with them, to the point where she had legitimately begun to wonder if they would try to force her or trick her into doing it.

While she had always thought Kyouko and especially Homura tragically stubborn for refusing help when they needed it, she felt she had special circumstances.

*They probably all think they have special circumstances,* Machina commented.

Mami shifted in surprise, having been completely lost in her own thoughts. She was supposed to be reviewing developments in the latest generation of experimental naval bombers; judging by how much she could recall about the topic, she hadn\'t even gotten started.

She leaned into her arm, propping her elbow on the desk in front of her.

*I\'m not going to consent to go near their telepaths now, Machina,* she thought. *I can read the evidence. The MHD\'s own secret documentation states clearly that spontaneous cerebral hemorrhages are one classic mind‐reading countermeasure used by powerful telepaths. I don\'t know how, but I somehow did that* to *her, and afterwards she wouldn\'t even talk to me about it. They\'re either hiding something, or they want to take my head apart to figure out what I did. Either way...*

*No, I agree, Mami, but just because you have reasons to be suspicious of them doesn\'t mean you\'re alright---*

\"I *know* I\'m not alright!\" Mami snapped, out loud to her empty room.

She let out a breath, calming herself down.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said.

*Of course I know I\'m not alright,* she thought, leaning forward in her chair to press the palm of her hand into her forehead despairingly. We\'ve discussed this already. I can\'t hide from it anymore. Everything seems to indicate that I must have been Reformatted at some point. But by who? And why? And who is this girl that I can\'t remember? From all I\'ve ever heard, if I\'ve figured out this much, the memory deletion should have already fallen apart. But I* still *can\'t remember.*

*Do you even want to know?* Machina asked. *A Reformat wouldn\'t be done without a good reason, and for all we know you did it yourself.*

*I don\'t think I have any choice* but *to know,* Mami thought. *At this point, the walls are clearly starting to come down. Unless I find out who did this to me and just* ask *them to do it again, I have no choice. And that\'d just be putting the consequence off.*

*Is putting it off really that bad of an idea, given your current position in the military?* Machina thought. *You\'re too important for the MSY to lose.*

*And* that\'s *why I don\'t trust the MHD,* Mami thought. *Why do you think I came all the way out here? Vlad is an old friend, and he\'s... different.*

*What we need is an old friend who is a telepath, who can be trusted Machina began.

*No,* Mami thought. *If something like this has happened, there\'s too high a chance my \'old friends\' are involved. What I really need is someone who* isn\'t.

*Let\'s find one, then,* Machina suggested.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Are you really okay with all this?\"

Ryouko looked up from taking off her socks, wondering why Asami would choose to ask a question like that *now*.

\"That\'s a bit vague,\" she said, pushing herself up onto the bed so she could look her girlfriend more in the eye. \"Can you be more precise?\"

Asami, who had up until now been standing still watching Ryouko unwind, began to walk around their room slowly. Their room, while well‐furnished, was a definite step down from Mami\'s, and certainly lacked the lived‐in appeal of the flat they still had on Eurydome. It was also *much* smaller, and after having lived in the colonies briefly, they were starting to get tired of cramped spaces.

Asami raised an arm and gestured broadly.

\"You know, living on this asteroid, doing more of these experiments, hiding from Goddess knows who. We don\'t even know what would happen if they\'re successful. Don\'t you like having more control over your life?\"

Ryouko let her hair drape over her eyes, wiggling her toes idly. Asami\'s comment stung, because the thought had crossed her mind, yet she hadn\'t found herself willing to complain to Mami.

\"I\'m starting to think I won\'t get that kind of freedom for a while, not until whatever this all is is over with. I feel like I\'ve made some kind of devil\'s bargain. I wouldn\'t be able to see all these places or do all this without my wish, but to do this my wish needs precise control of my life. Or something like that.\"

Asami opened her mouth slightly, then closed it again, before shaking her head.

\"That doesn\'t even really make sense,\" she said. \"How exactly did your wish give you this thing in your head, or make you descended from all these people, or any of that?\"

\"It could be retroactive,\" Ryouko said, avoiding Asami\'s eyes. \"It just makes too much sense. No one has ever proven wishes can\'t be retroactive.\"

She didn\'t like saying it out loud, because she knew it sounded paranoid.

\"No one has ever proven they can be either! That\'s stupid!\" Asami said, voice tinged with a sudden anger that surprised Ryouko. Her hands shook, clenched into fists.

Ryouko looked back in shock as Asami visibly dialed herself back, swallowing.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said, putting a hand to her head. \"I---it\'s just, if they could be retroactive, why wasn\'t mine retroactive? Instead I have to remember all this---all this nonsense about my parents. It could have at least erased my memories for me. Or my brother\'s.\"

Multiple answers filled Ryouko\'s head, ranging from \"maybe you didn\'t have enough potential\" to \"you had to have some reason to make a wish, after all.\" She swallowed them all, and instead said:

\"Part of me wishes I could forget all this about some kind of organ in my head, or at least that my mother was involved somehow. Part of me wishes that we could find out who or what is behind all this. But we\'re out of wishes, aren\'t we? We have to face the world as it is.\"

Ryouko felt Asami\'s eyes on her for a moment, even as she chose to stare carefully at the chair next to the door of the room, abandoned after they had used it to take off their shoes.

Asami sat down next to her, and Ryouko could almost feel the other girl relax her shoulders.

\"I\'m not sure I believe that,\" she said. \"After all, I\'m not sure even the Ancients keep their eyes open to everything. I don\'t talk to anyone about my parents, and you---well, I told you not to tell your mother, and you agreed with me once you had a few days to think about it.\"

\"I can\'t convince you otherwise, because I\'m not sure you\'re wrong,\" Ryouko said. \"But from what I\'ve seen, not facing it now just means you have to face it later, sometimes much later. Not even the Ancients are immune to that.\"

Asami took a careful, deep breath.

\"I\'ll take your word for that. You have more experience with them than me, after all.\"

She leaned against the wall, distorting the default view of the stars it was engaged in displaying.

\"Well, let\'s face it then,\" she said. \"If you\'re right, what does that mean? How long are you going to keep getting run into new places? When can you ever stop and just stay home? Why can\'t it wait a couple of years?\"

Uncharacteristically, Asami seemed to be avoiding direct contact with her, as if she worried it would interrupt the conversation.

*It can\'t wait because* I *couldn\'t wait,* Ryouko thought, reaching out with one hand, but aborting the gesture.

\"I don\'t know when it will end,\" she said, finally. \"But I\'m pretty sure...\"

She paused, wondering if she really wanted to say something like that.

\"Whatever it is, I\'m pretty sure you must be part of that,\" Ryouko said, grabbing the other girl\'s hand and looking her in the eye. \"It makes too much sense. Gravity and wormholes? The way we met?\"

\"Are you saying we\'re fated to be together somehow?\" Asami said, frowning. \"Because of your wish or something?\"

\"Something like that,\" Ryouko said, tilting her head slightly.

\"That\'s a really romantic thing to say,\" Asami said, shaking her head. \"But I don\'t *want* to be fated. I---too much of my life is manipulated by wishes already. Sometimes I feel like it\'s all I ever have to deal with. I want this one thing, at least to, be my own.\"

Ryouko ducked her head, wondering if she had said something wrong.

\"I don\'t think it really matters in this case,\" she said. \"From what I understand, wishes often take the path of least resistance. If the wish *was* responsible for us, then it probably chose to put us together because we were already compatible. We just never would have met otherwise.\"

\"That makes me feel a little better,\" Asami said, smiling slightly, though Ryouko didn\'t know what to make of the expression in her eyes.

Ryouko thought for a while longer. What was usually the right thing to do in this kind of situation?

\"So do you want to---\" she began.

\"No,\" Asami said, shaking her head. \"Let\'s see if we can set the far wall to show us something romantic. Like those spires on San Giuseppe, the ones we visited with Azrael.\"

\"Alright,\" Ryouko said, allowing herself to be distracted by the task of finding a suitable presentation.

They sat there on the bed a while longer, holding hands, watching and wondering.

## Sub Rosa 

> Those who study the subject have long suspected that soul gems are an affront to the true nature of souls, an inherently unstable crystallization of a continuous fluid that is bound to someday dissipate. Full with the emotional urgency of a human contractee, in the moment of the wish the soul rebels against the existing nature of things, fracturing reality itself, and sealing itself away from an unjust world.
>
> But the energy of such a rebellion can never be forever maintained, and from the moment of contract, the soul inevitably blackens, recovering only with a steady diet of grief cubes, powering itself with the accumulated pain of our uncontracted brethren.
>
> It is only natural, then, that at the end of a magical girl\'s lifespan, when the energy runs out or the gem is shattered, the soul dissipates, returning to the continuous ether from which we all spring.
>
> An appealing story, but it has never quite made sense to me. There are a number of conflicting observations that can be---and have been---made, but the most important involve soul gem disappearance. The mechanics of the standard theory suggest that the final failure of the soul gem, the fracturing of the gem itself, should release a tremendous amount of energy, as one would expect from an unstable state inevitably toppling. This final dissipation should seem almost like a relief, like the return of the soul to a more natural state.
>
> Of course, it is nothing like that. The process is incredibly painful, but ends in no release of energy whatsoever, a result that even the Incubators claim to find mystifying.
>
> I find this dissatisfying. The theory makes *too* much sense to end in such an odd anticlimax. I believe there must be some other force that prevents the energy of the phase transition from manifesting, something that either collects or nullifies the energy. But what?
>
> The Incubators are one candidate, but their protestations on the topic seem too legitimately displeased to sustain a lie like this. For my part, the comment that if they were really collecting this extra energy, they wouldn\'t bother denying it, rings true. After all, what\'s a little energy between friends at the end of life?
>
> For further insight, we have turned to collecting interviews from those who have witnessed this form of death. While a delicate task, it has proven fruitful, especially when combined with certain observations made in the unethically gathered research notes of Mikuni Oriko. There is a strong sense in the data that the shattering of the soul gem is no mere transition of the soul back to a more natural form, but more of a phase transition in the true sense. The energy of the shattering gem is not lost, but instead contained in a new, more stable and powerful form.

> There is some other force at work here, and if it is acting to drain magical girls of magic that should rightfully be theirs, it is in the interests of both humans and Incubators to learn what, or who, they are...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azrael Maslanka remembered the clouds and skies of her homeworld, in the years before her people had destroyed themselves. Back then, life had seemed full of promise, and the warm sun on her wings had felt like the favor of a benevolent deity.

She sighed, twitching her spinal thorns under the jacket she was using to conceal her back. She swallowed down another wave of claustrophobia as she returned to reality, remembering that where she was *actually located was the inside of a tiny asteroid‐locked science station, with corridors she couldn\'t even fully stretch her wings in.

*What even gives?* she thought spitefully. *I thought my psych file said clearly that I hate being in closed spaces like this. Sure, I got a big room, but this is worse than most starships.*

She knew she was just grousing, though. When the Chair of the General Staff called for you to travel to a remote secret base, you *went, since presumably it was important. It also wasn\'t all bad: it turned out that, of all people, Shizuki Ryouko and Nakihara Asami were here too.

In fact, that was ostensibly why she was here---she was supposed to be helping train the two of them for their next mission, though she sincerely doubted that was the *real* reason.

She supposed it at least gave her the opportunity to further embarrass herself by her attraction to those less than half her age.

*Better than Sakura Kyouko,* she snarked.

She sighed again, the attempt at humor not making herself feel any better.

*Well, whatever,* she thought. She\'d been through worse things than simple cabin fever, and seen things that made her own childhood experiences seem tame in comparison. She could stand a short meeting with the all‐important Tomoe Mami, especially if it got her finally on the glide path to another mission.

That was what she told herself, but she was still so wrapped up in the topic of space that the first thing she did stepping into Mami\'s quarters was to look around, checking out how much space a Field Marshal would get on this science station.

About as much as she had, it turned out. Someone *had* read her psych file, after all.

It was only then that she noticed that the programmable wall was covered in what looked like pictures of historical events, scribbled notes, and a prominent picture of Akemi Homura. She noticed then that a hologram of her and Homura posing together was circled just underneath it, and next to that a publicity shot of her and Ryouko.

She couldn\'t help but stare, enough that Mami stepped over hastily to her side.

\"Oh, sorry! I didn\'t mean to leave that up there! Yes, I know about you and Homura. It was, uh, part of my investigation into her disappearance.\"

Azrael blinked, wondering abruptly if this was going to be about Homura. Someone had come to ask her about Homura after the disappearance, once long ago, but she didn\'t have anything to offer. She still didn\'t, of course.

\"I see?\" she responded, making it into a statement. \"I\'m a bit surprised that that\'s what this meeting is about.\"

\"It\'s not. Not directly, anyway,\" Mami said, and it occurred to Azrael for the first time that Tomoe Mami, whom she had only met a few times previously at official functions, looked decidedly out of sorts. It might have been her imagination, but she was pretty sure her *hair was slightly out of alignment.

\"Take a seat,\" Mami said, as a large set of modular furniture parts hurried to reassemble themselves, scrabbling along the floor, something which never failed to give Azrael the willies. \"I\'m sorry I didn\'t have it ready in time. I\'ve been so busy.\"

Azrael sat down a moment later and tried to relax, even though she was convinced she could still feel the chair moving underneath her.

\"No, it\'s, uh, fine,\" she said, trying to be polite.

\"I\'ll have the synthesizer make us some tea,\" Mami said, sitting down in another chair across the table that had just appeared in front of her. \"Or would you prefer another drink?\"

\"Tea is fine.\"

The silence that followed was oppressive, and Azrael wished she at least had something to chew on. Instead, she could feel her back spines twitching nervously. If there was one thing she envied baseline humans for, it was the fact that they didn\'t have their backs flashing emotional signals---even hidden under a layer of clothing, it was obvious sometimes, and the skin‐tight sheaths her people had sometimes worn hid nothing at all. It was so much easier to just keep your wings on.

Abruptly, she realized she had zoned out, and found Mami leaning onto the table with her hands clasped in front of her mouth, peering at Azrael with an unsettling look. What was going on?

\"I\'m sorry to have to bring you out here,\" Mami said. \"It\'s not a place that suits you, I know. You must accept my apology.\"

Azrael shook her head.

\"It\'s my duty, after all.\"

\"No, not really,\" Mami said, unclasping her hands and leaning back in her chair. \"I came up with an official reason for this trip, but it\'s not the real reason. I brought you here for a personal favor.\"

\"Ah?\" Azrael said, almost involuntarily. This wasn\'t the line of conversation she had been expecting at all.

There was another pause in the discussion as a server drone appeared to place their tea and cookies on the table.

\"You\'re a telepath, aren\'t you?\" Mami asked, finally, rather bluntly.

\"Yes,\" she said, resisting the urge to look away.

\"You\'ve never worked for the MHD or directly for the Telepaths\' Guild, right?\"

\"I would never have had the time to. I\'ve spent most of my life in training or on missions,\" Azrael said. \"It was a condition of the deal that let me keep my modifications. Of course I\'m a member of the Guild though; we all are. But I don\'t think I\'ve ever heard from them since my introduction letter.\"

Strictly speaking, she didn\'t know if Mami knew the truth about her, but it was obviously a pretty safe assumption.

Mami nodded, downing her cup of tea in one gulp.

*Doesn\'t that burn?* Azrael couldn\'t help but think.

\"Did Akemi Homura say anything to you before she left?\" Mami asked. "Any specific instructions, any hints to the future, anything like that?\"

\"Uh, no, definitely not. She was just visiting me to be friendly, I think.\"

Azrael\'s eye twitched, as she felt the definite signs of someone trying to probe her thoughts. It took her only a moment to realize it was Mami* herself, despite the fact that Mami wasn\'t reputed to be a telepath.

\"I don\'t know what has you so worried,\" Azrael said honestly, \"but I\'m not lying. Read my thoughts if you want to.\"

\"As I expected,\" Mami said, expression and words enigmatic.

Azrael hid her unease at the situation by taking a slow drink of the tea she had been offered, enduring for the moment Mami\'s continued probing of her mind. What *exactly* could warrant this kind of examination? This was hardly the MSY Founder she had been led to expect from her public persona.

\"What is this about, anyway?\" Azrael asked, when she couldn\'t stand the suspense anymore. \"Are you still trying to gauge my trustworthiness?\"

Mami closed her eyes and put a hand to her head, looking for a moment as if she were exhausted.

\"I find myself very conflicted,\" Mami said. \"There is... I have uncovered evidence that I\'ve been Reformatted. I don\'t know who did this to me, but I\'m pretty sure the damned---the MHD, at least, knows about it. I have powers I have no memory of developing, dreams about people I can\'t remember, and gaps in my recollection centered around , but I just can\'t get any more than that. The worst part is, everyone I\'d normally ask is exactly who I can\'t trust. I need help, from someone who isn\'t in my old circle of friends. It\'s a terrible feeling.\"

The field marshal looked almost relieved to say the words, collapsing onto her arms in front of Azrael. Azrael, for her part, could barely take in the words said in her direction, blinking blankly at Mami while the wheels of her mind spun in various directions.

*How have I gotten involved in this---*

*Reformatted? Her?*

*This isn\'t an official---*

\"Why me?\" she said finally. \"I don\'t have any training on this. All I ever use my power for is to mind‐read colonists. The MHD---\"

\"I can\'t trust the MHD!\" Mami snapped impatiently, before dialing herself back with a visible effort. \"Like I said, unless I\'ve guessed wrong, they\'re partly responsible for the Reformatting in the first place. There\'s no way they\'d tell me the truth.\"

Azrael sucked in a breath, putting down her tea carefully to keep her hands from shaking too much. She tried to think back to her training, to what little she knew about the topic.

\"Are you sure you even want to know?\" Azrael asked, trying to be gentle. \"Reformats are often done for the good of the individual being Reformatted, and I... I doubt it was done just to keep secrets from someone like you.\"

She cringed preemptively, bracing herself for an angry outburst, but it didn\'t arrive.

Mami just sighed audibly, sitting up stiffly in her chair.

\"I don\'t know either,\" she said, avoiding Azrael\'s gaze. \"Of course I don\'t. I refuse to have my memory erased again, but I can\'t stay here much longer either. The only people who know are a few senior officers... The MSY is probably tearing their hair out trying to find me---it won\'t be long before they just read someone\'s mind and contact the base. I\'m sorry to say, I don\'t trust Sakura‐san or Chitose‐san on this matter. My TacComp and I have gone back over the records, and we\'re pretty sure they\'re involved.\"

Azrael didn\'t need to be a mind‐reader to hear the conflict and strain in Mami\'s voice. She couldn\'t imagine what it was like---Azrael didn\'t even have any good friends, much less any friends who she had known for over a dozen times her current age.

She sucked in a breath. She had always felt a bit detached from the rest of the MSY, and didn\'t hold the same reverence for the Founders many of her peers did. It was difficult to get into the same mindset, when the MSY had helped found the monoculture that insisted her people were inhuman outsiders, and who had taken as a price for her wings her entire youth---a decision the MSY had tacitly acquiesced to, one that Homura had even once apologized for.

But a lack of reverence did not mean that she lacked simple human empathy, and it was obvious what a tough position Mami was in. Indeed, in a twisted way, her isolation from the rest of Humanity likely made her the best telepath to trust---provided, of course, that she had been willing to let Mami read her mind.

\"What do you want me to do, then?\" she asked quietly, speaking into the silence that had developed between them.

\"I need someone to help me break the lock on my remaining memories,\" Mami said. \"Whoever performed the Reformatting did an incredible job. My memories should be recovering on their own, but they\'re just... not. I\'ve tried probing it myself with what telepathy I\'ve recovered, but I can tell my skills are incomplete, and I don\'t have the time to retrain or break through myself.\"

\"You\'re a telepath, then?\" Azrael asked, risking a probing question. "I had thought...\"

\"Not by default,\" Mami said, intercepting the sentence before Azrael could finish it. \"I seem to have started developing the ability at some point, perhaps as a result of having to spend so much time trying to conduct diplomacy of one sort or another. I have some faded memories of Science Division telling me that I was a brand‐new phenomenon, an elder magical girl developing new magical powers. That\'s fairly typical now, of course, but at the time no one had ever heard about it. I was apparently pretty good at it.\"

Azrael nodded along.

\"I can\'t honestly say I\'ve had too much advanced training on the subject,\" she said. \"But you had trouble getting anyone else, I assume?\"

\"Yes,\" Mami said.

Azrael let out a breath.

\"Alright, do you still remember the Tanaka posture?\" she asked. \"You can look it up if you don\'t. It\'s standard stuff.\"

\"Yes,\" Mami said, somehow hesitant. \"Hold hands, look into each other\'s eyes, and try not to fall in love, as Tanaka‐san so elegantly put it.\"

Her voice sounded dry on the last part, which was appropriate.

\"Yes, that one,\" Azrael agreed, raising her hands for the posture. "Skin‐to‐skin and direct eye contact facilitates cooperative telepathic merger, should you so desire.\"

\"Yes, I remember that now,\" Mami, clasping her hands in an almost airy tone. \"Someone said that exact line to me once, as we were doing something like this.\"

\"We can figure it out,\" Azrael said reassuringly. \"I just hope it isn\'t anything too bad. Is there...\"

*My bodyguards have been warned,* Mami thought, answering the question before she said it. *They know what to do if worse comes to worst.*

*They don\'t like it,* Azrael thought, as their eyes locked and she read the thought directly. *But they respect your decision. Even if Xiao Long actually works for the MHD, she is loyal enough to let you try, now that you\'ve gotten this far.*

*Yes...* Mami thought, her mental voice echoing oddly in Azrael\'s mind, the distinction between their two thoughts already starting to blur. Azrael could tell that whatever it was that had happened in Mami\'s past, she definitely *had* undergone training at some point---it was difficult even for natural telepaths to so easily let go of the natural wall around one\'s identity.

*What was it the philosophers said?* someone thought, as Azrael peered into the other girl\'s eyes. *They had been so* sure *that Volokhov was right about minds being fluid---and then they had discovered soul gems.*

*I\'ve always been of the opinion that soul gems are unnatural, a crystallized prison for something not meant to be imprisoned,* someone else thought. *Perhaps that\'s why the Incubators can get so much power from them.*

*It\'s not just you. That\'s a fairly common view in the Telepaths\' Guild. Though that\'s always seemed a bit too conveniently self‐affirming for me.*

Then the world around them drained away, and Azrael felt herself falling into the other girl\'s eyes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*When she emerged again, she found herself sitting in the backseat of an archaic vehicle, in an unfamiliar body.*

*No, a* car, *they realized. And this body was one of an adult standard human.*

*Then the context for what was happening came back to them---her? The distinction seemed oddly unimportant. But she had been summoned here for an important meeting, one she* had *to attend.*

\"*Tomatsu‐san?*\" *her attendant asked politely, holding the door open for her. It was a bit of a needless luxury, having a human attendant in an age when the cars drove and opened themselves, but she liked to think of herself as providing jobs to those who needed them. In fact, there was that one time---*

Focus, *she thought, the command seeming almost to come from somewhere outside her.*

*Indeed, the world they were in had started to spiral away, and it took an effort of will to return, grabbing the handle of the door and stepping gracefully out of the car.*

\"*Thank you, Akiyuki‐san,*\" *she said.* \"*I apologize; I\'ve been a bit distracted.*\"

\"*Understandable, ma\'am. The meeting room is this way.*\"

*She allowed Akiyuki to take the lead. He was a young man, only in his twenties, and she had taken him on after the death of his late father, who had been one of her most trusted attendants. It had raised eyebrows, taking in a male TNC in an organization that vastly preferred taking in girls, and had even inspired some lascivious commentary, but she chose not to care about such things. She preferred---*

Mami! *part of her complained.*

*Yes, she definitely needed to concentrate, she realized, as the memory snapped back into focus. There was something here intent on distracting her, pulling her away from the memory she was trying to find. Machina hadn\'t been able to help her, but maybe Azrael could.*

*She found Akiyuki waiting for her at the elevator in the underground car garage, giving her an odd look. She wondered why her behavior seemed to be impacting* his *behavior, in what was supposed to be a memory, but she didn\'t allow the thought to distract her. No, she would move forward, no matter how much she wanted to reminisce about the world around her.*

You miss the past, don\'t you? *the voice from earlier asked.*

I do, *she thought.*

Why don\'t you ever think back to it, then?

I do! All the time!

But not this part?

*She considered the issue for a moment, even as she watched an older version of Mitakihara through the walls of the elevator. The city shifted and morphed in front of them, vague and ever‐changing, a century of construction and development flickering through her mind.*

Not in a long time, *she conceded.*

Why not?

I feel like it would hurt too much.

*Just thinking the sentence seemed to break a seal of some sort, enough so that she felt herself dazzled by the revelation. She avoided* ever thinking about this part of history, without even realizing she was doing so. In retrospect, it had always been there, lurking in the rear of her mind, like an itchy woolen shirt that she could never take off but was trying to ignore.*

Just what happened in those years? *she thought, trying to think back.*

*It had been a time of rapid expansion and consolidation, the Charter had just been rewritten for the second time to allow for a much faster‐growing organization, they had just finished that damn nonsense in China...*

\"*We\'re here, ma\'am,*\" *Akiyuki said, interrupting her chain of thought. They had abruptly reached the top floor.*

\"*Thank you,*\" *she said, stepping out into the hallway.*

*She took a moment to look around, peering down the hallways of the MSY\'s old haunt. She could tell now that she had passed some kind of invisible barrier---her thoughts felt crystal clear in comparison to the muddle they had been before, and she could detect the flaws that usually characterized this kind of journey into one\'s own memory. The details of the world around her were vague and inconsistent, becoming clear only when she focused her attention on them, as her mind invented something to fill in the gaps in recollection, exactly analogous to a dreamscape. Otherwise, only a few key things were clear: the clean, sterile smell of the building that she had always hated, the paintings that she had helped choose---naturally, the objects with the most salience in her memory.*

*This was how it was* supposed *to be; the clarity a telepath could bring to an otherwise murky recollection was unparalleled, and part of the problem with her previous attempts to break in was that it simply hadn\'t been that way.*

*Akiyuki waited impatiently for her to finish what she was doing, a behavior the real Akiyuki would never have shown. By now, though, it was quite clear that this was no pure memory---there was something communicating back to her, and she suspected she was about to get a direct audience.*

*She stepped forward, and opened the door.*

*For a moment she stood there blinking on the threshold, feeling oddly as if something had changed again. What was---*

\"Akemi‐san?\" she said, in nearly automatic shock, even as she knew it was a ridiculous reaction to have in a situation like this.

The once‐First Executive of the MSY stood with her back facing her, leaning over the desk in the center of the room focused on something, just as she had seen her once, so long ago.

*Yes,* she realized, grabbing feverishly onto a memory she had lost. Homura had called her in once just like this.

But this was incorrect. It hadn\'t just been the two of them. There had been Yuma, and Kyouko, and others.

Homura\'s long black hair shifted on her shoulders as she finally acknowledged her arrival, and she couldn\'t help remembering how impossibly black it had always been, black enough that the rumors said it was augmented by magic. It was eerily beautiful.

\"I always knew you would make it back here someday,\" Homura said, without turning.

\"Was it you that did this?\" she asked.

\"If you thought harder about that question, you\'d know the answer already,\" Homura said, with her usual diminished affect. \"But that\'s not really your fault, I suppose. Before you ask: no, I\'m not the real Homura or any part of her, and I don\'t have any more idea than you do where she is.\"

With a sharp gesture, Homura turned to face her, hair swirling behind her. Homura had always been like that, a living contrast between practiced calm and almost excessively decisive action.

\"But it seems we have a visitor,\" Homura said. \"I must apologize, but this is a rather private matter for Mami. I\'m sure she appreciates your contribution, but if you\'ll agree to leave, I will in turn stop interfering with Mami\'s memory recovery.\"

\"Who are you?\" Azrael asked, though the words came out of Mami\'s mouth.

\"I can\'t answer that,\" Homura said, shaking her head. \"Not with you here.\"

\"What if I want her to stay?\" Mami asked, in the same voice.

\"Then she may stay,\" Homura said. \"I\'m not the controlling authority here.\"

She left the obvious question unanswered, even as a heartbeat passed in waiting.

\"You\'re not going to ask why I want her to stay?\" Mami asked.

\"I\'m the one here who has to answer questions,\" Homura said. \"I don\'t need to ask *you* questions. I\'m a figment of your mind, after all.\"

\"Are you really, though?\" Mami asked.

\"That\'s a foolish question, Tomoe Mami,\" Homura said, thought she smiled slightly to dispel a possible insult.

She may not have been Homura, but she sure *acted* like one, she thought---and that came from both of them. Mami, specifically, remembered a time when Homura had never smiled for anything. It had mystified them, when the pigtailed Homura they had known turned into the quietly intense, long‐haired Homura that everyone else knew. She and Kyouko just couldn\'t understand what might have caused it, but Mami had a better understanding now---after all, she was the one who was currently occupied talking with \"a figment of her mind\".

And, in the end, even Homura had changed over four centuries of life. Mami had seen that. Yet the Homura that had visited Azrael was almost like a different person all over again. There was a side to her that Mami had never seen. Mami could only wonder if Homura had gotten so enmeshed in her usual persona that she didn\'t dare show even her oldest friends anything else.

Perhaps especially her oldest friends. Mami knew that feeling, now, and felt the usual pang in her heart that came from pondering her failure to save her.

\"Leeching memories from the girl you asked for help?\" Homura asked. "That\'s not very nice.\"

\"It\'s almost impossible to avoid, Akemi‐san!\" Mami complained. \"I know you know that!\"

\"Well, it\'s true that Homura knew that,\" Homura said, smilingly condescendingly. \"The question is why *you* know that, or why you know that Homura knew that.\"

With an abrupt fury, Mami found herself raising her hand to slap this mocking Homura, but with Azrael\'s help managed to control herself.

She took a deep breath.

\"Well, you promised answers,\" Mami said.

\"I implied that, yes,\" the girl in front of her said, dropping her gaze downward. \"I said I wouldn\'t ask any questions, but I will ask one: Do you really want to know?\"

\"I\'m not going to turn back now,\" Mami said, though she knew her voice didn\'t sound all that determined.

\"Alright, then, let\'s clarify the situation,\" the girl said. "Azrael?\"

A chair materialized to Mami\'s right, the slightly built Azrael appearing seated in it a moment later, complete with a tremendous pair of white wings neatly furled behind her back. She had her hands folded in her lap politely, as if waiting.

The separation was complete---mostly. She could still feel Azrael\'s stabilizing presence in the back of her mind, without which she doubted she would have been able to hold onto even a semblance of her calm. Before, the blurring influence of the flashback had muted her unease, but now it was back full force. Just what had gone wrong with her life? At the ripe old age of four hundred sixty‐five, she would have expected to be long past madness like this.

*Who is this girl?* she found herself wondering, examining the black‐haired girl in front of her. It wasn\'t Homura, not anymore, but she found herself unable to look her in the face. There was just, still, that hair...

\"What if I were to intervene?\" a new voice said, and it took Mami a moment after turning to properly understand that the voice was *hers, and that she was looking at her own face, just ten years older, in a physical age group she hadn\'t had to wear for at least a few decades.

She put a hand to her head and staggered backwards, stumbling into a chair that had conveniently materialized behind her.

\"I don\'t know how I\'m supposed to interpret this,\" she said. \"So you\'re me, then? I\'m behind my own problems?\"

\"In a manner of speaking, though I wouldn\'t say you *caused* the problems, so much as tried to mitigate them.\"

\"Speak clearly,\" Mami insisted, pitching her voice to make it clear she meant it as a demand.

\"You waited quite a while to develop any telepathic powers, but once you did, you proved to be uniquely gifted at it,\" the other Mami said. "Those who studied it, including yourself, thought it had to be partly due to your wish, that wishing to be tied to life helped you to tie yourself into others.\"

The voice echoed oddly in her head, such that Mami found it mingling with her own thoughts. The memories came back to her in a torrent---reading others\' minds with ease, practicing basic techniques with Atsuko Arisu, arguing with Yuma about the morality of developing more than just simple *reading.*

\"The conventional wisdom about Reformatting is that it is always unstable in the long‐run,\" the other Mami said, almost as if reciting from a textbook or document. \"Unless a practiced telepath reapplies the Reformat on a regular basis, usually at least once every half‐century or so, it becomes leaky, and eventually falls apart entirely.\"

\"The logic is similar to what applies to the Soul Magics,\" Mami said, continuing the explanation herself, though she could not suppress a nervous look at Azrael, who probably wasn\'t cleared for this information. \"The Soul is sacrosanct, perhaps even beyond this material plane, and as such inviolate to outside manipulation in the long‐term. Better results are always obtained with the consent of the receiving party, and the *best* results only when the party operates on itself.\"

\"The Law of Cycles, or at least a part of it,\" the other Mami said. "Even at its greatest duress, as the soul gem itself runs out of power, the soul does not fail; it only disappears, perhaps returning to where it originally came from.\"

\"That\'s religious claptrap!\" Mami said, unsure even herself why her reaction was so sharp.

\"Is it?\" the other Mami said. \"But *you\'re* the one who wrote it.\"

Another piece of the puzzle clicked into place in her head. Yes, the Law of Cycles, that rumored ruleset governing magical girls. She had once found it to give her solace, in a world where she knew she was only a few disasters away from disappearing like so many of her contemporaries. Even as Kyouko had laughed at her, and Homura had peddled her illogical beliefs about a magical girl deity, she had once carefully studied the matter. There had been... something wrong with the theory. If the Soul was so inviolate, then how did magical girls exist at all? What were the demons, and how were the Incubators extracting energy from them?

It had been a matter of importance to her once, before she had forgotten about it utterly. So much so that when Kyouko had founded her Cult, she had wholly refused to entertain any of her theories, even as Kyouko seemed so, so certain that...

\"We\'re getting off‐track,\" Azrael said. \"I\'m sure that\'s fascinating, but that\'s not what we\'re here to talk about.\"

\"Well, that\'s not *entirely* true,\" the other Mami said. \"But it is indeed better that we talk about something else. Specifically, the fact that Reformatting is substantially more stable when the Reformatting is performed on oneself.\"

\"Yes, I\'ve gotten the message,\" Mami said impatiently, almost sardonically. \"The most likely answer to this situation is that you and, and her---\"

She gestured at the other girl.

\"---were placed here by me, using these telepathic powers I apparently have. The amount of time the Reformatting has lasted isn\'t even the best evidence. The best evidence is that the memories stayed sealed even when I started to suspect that I had been Reformatted, even when I tried to break it. Memories just can\'t stay blocked like that when their owner wants them back, not unless the owner placed the block herself, using a piece of that self.\"

\"Indeed,\" the other Mami said, looking up at the ceiling with an odd expression. She didn\'t look happy, or sad, only... relieved.

\"A piece of yourself?\" Azrael asked, looking worried. \"What does that mean?\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Mami said, quite honestly. \"I don\'t know why I said that, but the words came naturally.\"

\"Memories always return because they are a piece of the soul,\" the not‐Homura said, in a maddeningly familiar voice. \"That is the rule. It stands to reason, then, that the only gatekeeper capable of holding memories back would be the soul itself.\"

\"A piece of the soul,\" Mami said, comprehension dawning. \"Are you saying you\'re a piece of my soul? That I cut off a part of myself to do this? How? Why?\"

\"Haven\'t you always felt a little empty, Mami?\" the girl said. "Tired, old, as if you have given too much of yourself away? It wasn\'t just the obvious. We---\"

She closed her eyes for a moment, even as the Mami doppelgänger next to her finally turned her head away from looking upward.

\"We have grown tired of standing guard here,\" the other Mami said. "Tired, and weak. How capable we are is a function of your will, and the times have changed. The world has changed. We did not stop fighting, but perhaps it is time you faced what you once could not. We long to return home. To you.\"

\"Perhaps it is for the best that Azrael is here after all,\" the other girl said, smiling wanly.

Mami felt an abrupt longing deep within her, clawing at her very essence. A profound *need,* to finally put an end to a long vigil.

In that moment she made her decision, and the two apparitions in front of her sighed with boundless relief, seeming to dissolve before her eyes. She, too, felt a broad sense of relief, a sense that, for the first time in a long time, she was whole again.

Then she caught a glimpse of the girl\'s face as she dissolved, the girl she knew must exist but could never, ever remember.

\"A... kari?\" she asked.

Then she remembered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Mami blearily forced her eyes open. She couldn\'t remember the last time she had been knocked unconscious. For a magical girl on a small team, that was nearly tantamount to death, so it was natural that she could count the occurrences on less than one hand, and all of them had been after Yuma\'s arrival.*

*What had she been doing---*

*The world abruptly sharpened around her, and she found herself pushing up out of the mud, heart filled with terrified haste, but body unable to manage any more speed.*

*As she staggered to her feet, she managed to take a peek at the soul gem on her finger. It was nearly entirely black, which made sense given her warped state of mind and the fact that she was clearly missing an arm. Somehow it seemed like only a minor consideration.*

Akari! *she thought desperately, casting her thought out wide over the burning world around her. The plane had gone down in flat countryside, and despite her last, mad attempt to slow its collision, it was clear from the gash cut into the earth below her, the scattered debris and still‐burning fires and body parts, that nothing human could have survived.*

*Nothing... human.*

Akari! *she pleaded again, as she stumbled forward, and this time she heard a feeble response far in front of her, more of a vague telepathic ripple than any coherent words.*

*She started to yell her name, then thought better of it when a sharp bite of pain made her realize that her throat was damaged. Instead she just started running, surprising herself with the speed she was still capable of.*

*The world in all its complexity, Korean diplomacy and international politics and Leadership Committee executive orders, contracted to a single point in front of her. Now there was just Mami, and Akari, and the narrow strip of hell between them.*

Mami, I--- *Akari thought, mental voice shot through with pain.*

Just shut it out! *Mami thought.* You know how! I\'m coming.

It\'s not---you shouldn\'t---

*And then Mami was there, hurling aside a piece of metal as if it were personally responsible for all that had happened.*

*It took everything she had not to break down weeping at the sight of her lover. As it was, she collapsed to her knees, reaching towards the other girl with her one arm, yet not daring to touch.*

I can tell you\'re there, *Akari thought.* The fire---there was an oil fire. I couldn\'t get away from it. I managed to shield myself, a little. I\'m amazed I\'m still alive.

*Akari used telepathy because she couldn\'t speak, and didn\'t talk about seeing because she couldn\'t see. She could only stay coherent by shutting out the pain, moving her soul so deep into her gem that her body would have seemed more like a distant mannequin than a true part of her self.*

*Mami couldn\'t stop the flood of tears, knew that she shouldn\'t even try.*

You\'ll be okay, *she thought.* The organization will come for us, and there will be healers. Don\'t let your gem waste any more energy trying to keep your body intact.

Can you find my gem? *Akari asked.* It should be somewhere... on me. Near my torso.

*There was nothing Mami relished less than the thought of reaching her hand out towards Akari\'s ruined flesh, but they both knew she had no choice.*

*She drew on her experience, her age, and pulled herself together as best she could. She would seal her tear ducts shut if she had to.*

Alright, *she thought tentatively.* I\'ll try to sense it.

*It was the work of only a few moments, leaning forward to hover her hands over what had been the other girl\'s belly, searching for the trace of magic that would signify her soul gem. Tempted---so tempted she was to start trying to heal her, pouring her own soul into the task of repairing Akari\'s body.*

*But she knew she wasn\'t a talented enough healer to be nearly enough help, and she doubted even Yuma could have done much with the little energy left in Mami\'s gem.*

I know what you\'re thinking, *Akari thought, shifting her head slightly.* You know it\'s a bad idea.

Don\'t move, *Mami ordered, straining to keep her fear out of her thoughts.* Just stay still.

We\'re telepaths, Mami, *Akari thought.* There\'s no reason to hide the truth. I\'m not making it.

*Mami avoided answering, finally finding the soul gem embedded partly within the flesh.*

*She could only close her eyes as she pulled, wrenching the bauble out with a sickening noise.*

*There was only a dim light remaining when she dared open her eyes again, but more, indeed, than she had dared to hope.*

It--- *she began.*

I saved my magic, *Akari thought.* I\'m good at things like that, and it\'s not like there was much I could do with it. You were trying to stop the plane from crashing, so you\'re a bit exhausted.

I should have never asked you to come, *Mami thought, letting her tears come to the forefront once more, water dripping uselessly into the ruined earth.* You should have stayed home.

Who do you think is responsible for this? *Akari thought, refusing to acknowledge Mami\'s thought.* That was no natural plane crash. Someone brought it down.

Whoever they are, they\'ll pay, *Mami thought, and she meant it as much as she ever meant anything. She was going to live through this for that, if nothing else.*

Hold onto that feeling, Mami, *Akari thought.* You need to live, for me.

What are you saying? You can---

*The ruined corpse in front of her lashed an arm out with shocking speed, gripping the hand Mami was using to hold the soul gem with force only a magical girl could manage, staining it with even more blood than was already there.*

*Their hands glowed a painful‐bright white, along with Akari\'s soul gem, and without having to think Mami knew what was happening.*

No! Please! *Mami pleaded, even as she felt the draining tension at the bottom of her own soul subside and relax.*

Listen to me, Mami! *Akari thought, fixing her unseeing gaze hauntingly onto Mami\'s eyes.* You\'re the one with the reduced soul gem drain, not me. It\'s not in our power to save me, but *you* can live, with this gift.

*Mami didn\'t have the words to speak, even as the light drained out of Akari\'s gem and into hers, and so it was Akari who eventually said:*

I finally get it.

What? Get what? *Mami asked, pleading for an answer she knew Akari didn\'t have the ability to provide.*

I wished to make a difference, *Akari said.* I was so confused when my wish changed nothing, and all I got were some weird powers. I thought... I had found it with you, building the MSY, working to change the world, but now I really understand. That was only part of it. This is... destiny.

Don\'t say things like that, *Mami thought.* I can\'t...

*She stopped her sentence there, instead letting their emotions mingle in the telepathic air between them. There was nothing that needed to be said that couldn\'t be conveyed more directly. Peering in Akari\'s mind, she could see that the girl\'s logic made cold sense: Akari had made a reputation in the more secretive arenas of the MSY with her ability to gauge and manipulate the ebb and flow of soul. She and Mami had traveled abroad, far afield of the MSY\'s rapid response teams, and they had crashed in the middle of nowhere, distant from any urban concentrations where local magical girls might take pity on them.*

*Simply put, there was no realistic prospect anyone with grief cubes could get here anytime soon, and the greatest chance they had of either of them surviving was to give everything to Mami, who naturally used less energy than other magical girls.*

*Mami swallowed. She wished she could take other girl\'s hands in hers, at the very least.*

You still have a tiny bit of power left, *she thought.* Let me take your soul gem away from your body and try to find help. Maybe... a miracle will happen.

*Mami felt Akari make the telepathic equivalent of a smile. How strange, that at a time like this Akari would seem so peaceful, when Mami felt her heart tearing to shreds inside her.*

I wouldn\'t even be awake for the end, then, *Akari thought.* I\'d rather you stay with me, and carry me down.

After all, *she added in almost dark humor,* we\'ve never had a soul mage monitor the last moments of soul gem failure. It might be interesting material for our theories.

I...

*Mami knelt there for a moment, head bowed, nearly a century of regret weighing her down. How desperately they---the MSY, Yuma, and even Mami herself---had sought to defeat this final enemy, and how empty‐handed they had all come up in the end. The Incubators claimed immortality was possible, if only there were enough energy, but Mami was no longer sure she wanted it. She should have been an old lady, soon to bury her regrets and her failures under the soil with her body, and instead she was still here, still unable to save those who depended on her, even the one who after all these years she had dared to love.*

Alright, *she thought, with a finality that hurt,* I\'ll be with you to the end.

*She didn\'t need to speak, or worry that Akari would sense Mami\'s immense guilt with her telepathy. They already knew the contents of each other\'s minds. There was nothing worth hiding.*

*Mami closed her eyes, and let their minds embrace. There was no need for eye contact, or hand‐holding, or all the usual tricks that were needed for telepaths who didn\'t know each other. It was natural as instinct, and the two of them together mourned the loss of half of the whole, even as that half prepared herself for death.*

*It was peaceful in its own way, the two of them more stable together than they were apart. There was in that inner world much more time, time enough to reminisce on better times, time enough to make last amends, time enough for calm.*

*Except...*

Something is... wrong, *Mami thought, as what they had expected to be a peaceful transition, a slow fade into oblivion accompanied by deep pain, managed by two lifetimes of experience in soul manipulation, turned... different.*

*A sharp, shattering pain seemed to strike them at her very core. Mami could feel Akari trying desperately to recede even further from the material world, but there was nowhere to go, since it was now obvious the pain came from somewhere else entirely.*

*As horrifying as that was, that was expected. What wasn\'t expected was the... other sensation that filled them. The sense that this was also the beginning of something new, something... terrifying.*

Please, let me move your soul gem, *Mami thought, herself reeling from the reflected pain.* You don\'t need to suffer like this.

I... want to know, *Akari thought.* I\'ve spent my whole life studying things like this. So many... unanswered questions.

It\'s not worth it! *Mami pleaded.* Not like this!

You don\'t understand, *Akari thought, even managing to convey the ghost of a strained smile through their telepathic link.*

*There was a long pause, within which Mami wasn\'t able to answer coherently.*

I said that I finally understood what... my wish was about, but now I suspect... there\'s another part to it, *Akari thought.* Can you imagine how valuable it might be to pierce the veil? Whatever it is that prevents the transformed state, locks us out of a tremendous amount of power. The implications could be... enormous. They might... change everything.

*Mami couldn\'t stand it any longer, no matter what Akari said. It felt like a betrayal, snapping open her eyes and wrenching Akari\'s soul gem away from her body, but she told herself that Akari was delusional, that the infamous despair spiral had grabbed hold of her and made her speak nonsense.*

*And yet even as Mami dashed away from the body as fast as she could manage, using Akari\'s gifted power, the connection between them improbably* didn\'t *break.*

*Akari had removed herself so far from her body that she was no longer even attached, and somehow, in some way, their thoughts still aligned.*

No, *Mami thought, a quiet whisper of a thought that seemed about as useless as she had been earlier trying to stop a plane from falling out of the sky.*

*Akari did not respond this time, and the pain was overwhelming, enough so that Mami could no longer sustain her run, falling uselessly to her knees on a patch of grass. She couldn\'t bear to break the connection forcibly, couldn\'t bear to just... leave... Akari like this.*

*And then she saw it, the crack working its way across Akari\'s pitch‐black soul gem. In it, she could see... she could see...*

*In that instant, she saw it, not with her eyes but in her mind, the image a mockery of all that either of them had ever struggled to achieve, an apparition of pure despair.*

*She saw, for a moment, something bright next to her, just out of sight.*

*And then it was over, the connection broken, the soul gem improbably vanished from her hand.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*How is she?*\" *Mami heard Homura ask, through the thick reinforced door that was supposed to be magically soundproof. She had disabled that protection mechanism the moment they locked her in here---she had every intention of knowing what was being said about her, if they were foolish enough to say it out loud. If they weren\'t, she could eavesdrop on telepathy as well.*

\"*Not well,*\" *Yuma said,* \"*but at least she\'s stable now. I\'m glad she didn\'t put up any resistance at being taken in.*\"

\"*Why would she?*\" *Kyouko asked.* \"*She killed the ones responsible for the plane crash. I\'d guess that\'s all she wanted. Trust me, you don\'t want to mess with Mami.*\"

*Mami looked down at her hands. The MHD\'s* \"*waiting rooms*\" *were designed to look as little like confinement cells as possible, lavishly appointed, stocked to the gills with snacks and drinks, and with an entertainment system that the average MSY member might have killed to acquire. Indeed, the table she was currently seated at was lovely, a polished stone masterpiece that Mami would have offered to buy in happier days. There was only the slightest oddities---a lack of sharp objects, only restricted access to the internet, and the faint background sensation of magic in the air.*

*She didn\'t see any of that at the moment, however. What she saw instead was rivulets of blood running down the skin of her hands, a memory she couldn\'t wash away, no matter how she tried. She had done more than merely survive---as promised, she had found those responsible, a rogue group of local magical girls opposed to the MSY\'s ventures in the area, who had thought it a good idea to take down a plane full of civilians just to stop a single diplomatic representative.*

*It had been quick work for someone of Mami\'s age, once she was calm enough to apply herself to the task. It had been surprisingly easy even in her diminished state to find an unattended demon spawn and feed. She knew where the likely suspects were, and she was a strong enough telepath to drag out the truth from their associates once she reached the area. After that...*

*Well, there was no way a half‐dozen neophyte magical girls could stand up to* her.

\"*Honestly, she did us all a bit of a favor,*\" *Yuma said, sighing. "*If only it had happened some other way. She\'s done a few things before, but never like this. She was always the best of us.*\"

The best of us... *Mami\'s thoughts echoed mockingly.*

\"*Have you read the report?*\" *Kyouko asked.* \"*There\'s something she won\'t tell us, won\'t tell* me.\"

\"*Of course I read the report,*\" *Homura said, managing to make a line that would have sounded impatient coming from anyone else sound neutral.*

\"*From what the telepaths were able to glean while she was asleep, she\'s been dreaming about the death of Akiyama Akari,*\" *Yuma said. "*It seems they were in a very close telepathic, perhaps soul‐based link as she died. There\'s something that happened---*\"

\"*Yes,*\" *Homura said.* \"*If you\'ll excuse me, I need to talk to her.*\"

*The door to the room began to open a moment later, ponderous lock mechanism taking long seconds to unwind.*

*Mami let out a breath when the door finally opened, and immediately felt ridiculous for doing so. At this juncture, why was it that she still cared what Homura thought? What any of her friends thought?*

*She knew the answer to that question, of course. She still cared, about everything, even after what she had done. She couldn\'t bring herself not to. That, in the end, was why she had come back, rather than end it all.*

*The question now was, was she going to tell them the truth? About the true fate of magical girls? How could she, when it had sapped her own faith in the MSY, and her motivation for the work? What was the point of any of it now, if the lives they lived were a monstrous lie?*

*The door slammed shut, and Mami realized that she had lost herself in her thoughts, completely ignoring Homura walking up to her.*

*Homura tilted her head, gesturing at the seat across from Mami, and Mami nodded. Homura was like that, most of the time---only speaking when she felt it necessary. Around friends, it was rarely necessary, so Homura was often silent.*

*At the same time, though, it was only around her friends that Homura ever truly unwound herself, so she could be surprisingly talkative on occasion.*

*Mami watched Homura help herself to some of the tea on the table. As always, she envied Homura her seemingly invincible unflappability.*

\"*You probably think I\'ve gone crazy,*\" *Mami said, deciding to open the conversation on her own terms.*

\"*Actually, not really,*\" *Homura said, peering at her with an unsettling gaze.* \"*I know you were listening in, so you know what I already know. The truth is unsettling, is it not?*\"

*Mami blinked, struggling to read the other girl\'s expression. She knew better than to try to mind‐read Homura---the girl had been practicing her anti‐telepath defense since the days of Oriko. More importantly, it was well‐known that Homura had some nasty traps in store for those who actually got in.*

*Homura nodded, as if answering Mami\'s implicit question.*

\"*You knew? You knew and you never said anything?*\" *Mami demanded, reaching over the table to grab Homura. Infused with a sudden rush of anger, she had somehow stopped herself from grabbing the other girl by the collar, which left her awkwardly grasping her by the arm instead.*

*Homura showed a rare flash of anger herself, smacking Mami\'s arm aside with a decisive gesture.*

\"*What exactly was I supposed to say? Would any of you have believed me? Would it have helped if you did?*\"

*The two of them locked eyes for a moment, and then Homura took a breath.*

\"*In any case, it\'s not technically true that I\'ve never mentioned it to you. I mentioned the Goddess saving us from a terrible fate a few times, though I had to be vague for a number of reasons.*\"

\"*You did, yes,*\" *Mami said, frowning as she fought to keep herself level. She tried to remember everything Homura had said to her on the topic. A Goddess who represented the Law of Cycles, who saved them from a terrible fate---*

*She clenched her hands against the table, filled with undefinable emotion.*

\"*I did the right thing not telling anyone, I think,*\" *Homura said, to no one in particular.* \"*You\'re reacting far better than I expected you to. I suppose that\'s a testament to age.*\"

\"*What is it exactly that you know?*\" *Mami demanded, not really sure what it was she wanted to hear.* \"*I\'m tired of this mystery act. Akari is* dead *and I\'ve been sitting here agonizing---I* killed *those girls, Homura‐chan. They were guilty, but I\'ve never done anything in such cold blood, not even when I ran the Soul Guard. All of that, and I know you\'re just sitting here judging me. What\'s with you, anyway?*\"

*The words spilled out in a torrent, and Mami knew she sounded unhinged, but she didn\'t care, because she* was *unhinged, and she was damn sure Homura knew it.*

*Homura let out a breath, one that was carefully calibrated to sound neither frustrated nor exasperated. Only... bothered by events.*

\"*Forgive me, Mami,*\" *she said.* \"*I am... not used to being honest. On this topic, it has only ever brought me grief, or at best disbelief. Yes, it is true what you and Akari have suspected---that when magical girls run out of energy, something must happen. As you discovered, what should *happen is a profound metamorphosis, one that the Goddess now prevents. I know you never believed in this, but Akari is in a better place now.*\"

*Mami shook her head.*

\"*I can\'t believe that,*\" *she said.* \"*Believe it or not, I do remember what you said, and I can\'t bring myself to believe what you say. You weren\'t there. You haven\'t experienced what I have. You haven\'t seen what she became.*\"

*She felt Homura\'s eyes on her for a long moment, before the girl stood up from the table and walked over to the window, which was actually a holographic screen designed to give the illusion of a window.*

\"*So what now?*\" *Mami asked, after a long silence.*

\"*Do you think you can keep the secret?*\" *Homura asked.* \"*Do you think you can still function as head of Recruitment and Diplomacy?*\"

*Mami laughed, bitterly.*

\"*What secret? We\'ve been talking out loud about it for the past five minutes. But no... I don\'t think I\'ll be able to keep it. You might as well lock me up in here for a long while, until I\'m ready to face the world.*\"

\"*I kept this conversation private, trust me,*\" *Homura said.* \"*But what do you think will happen to the MSY in the meantime? How will people react to your absence?*\"

\"*It will be a disaster,*\" *Mami said, since she had had plenty of time to think about it all.* \"*It doesn\'t exactly look good for us, having one of the leadership disappear at a moment like this.*\"

\"*Yes, and if we pretend you were merely shaken up by the plane crash, we have to acknowledge that you were targeted, which would enrage our voting members. The negotiations are delicate enough as it is.*\"

\"*I know that, but I\'m telling you I can\'t do it,*\" *Mami said.*

*Homura played with her hair for a moment, a habit that manifested when she was nervous.*

\"*I thought that might be the case,*\" *she said.*

*She turned back towards the window, hands clasped behind her back, seemingly deep in thought.*

\"*Homura...*\" *Mami began, waiting for the other girl to say something.*

\"*What is it?*\" *Homura asked, without turning.*

\"*Have you thought about Reformatting at all?*\" *Mami asked.*

*Homura turned, her eyes searching Mami\'s face for an answer. Mami could feel Homura\'s gentle probing of her mind, more of a request than an intrusion, since Homura wasn\'t powerful enough to manage more than that.*

\"*Of course I have,*\" *Homura said, voice sounding distant.* \"*I don\'t really believe in it---not as a tool for oneself, anyway. As a tool for others, perhaps. Besides, it\'s not like Reformatting lasts terribly long.*\"

*Homura and Mami watched each other for a long minute, Homura\'s deeply concerned expression more of a question than any words she could ever say.*

\"*I\'ve thought about it too,*\" *Mami said finally.* \"*It would make this all so much easier. I could do my job as I used to, without the crushing reminders in my heart. That\'s what it is, in the end, that makes this so terrible. I can\'t bear to live, but I also can\'t bear to leave what we\'ve done behind.*\"

*She left it at that, reviewing only in her mind all that had happened. The killings, the failures...*

*Akari...*

*To her surprise, she felt then a glimmer of Homura\'s mind, either leaked out from behind her telepathic defenses, or deliberately revealed. She felt a profound sense, not of pity or worry or anger as she had expected, but instead simply of* empathy, *of* understanding, as if Homura knew somehow exactly what Mami was going through. It was relieving to feel, even if Mami had no understanding of how Homura could possibly share her feelings.*

\"*I am surprised,*\" *Homura said, closing her eyes,* \"*but I suppose I should not be. I\'d be lying if I told you I\'d never considered it myself. But what\'s the plan for when the Reformatting fails? You\'re still going to have to deal with this someday.*\"

\"*I\'d like to think I will be older and wiser,*\" *Mami said.* \"*More importantly, I know how to get rid of these memories for a long, long time. I just need help with the process, from someone with some telepathic knowledge.*\"

*Homura clutched her hands for a moment.*

\"*I will respect your decision, then,*\" *she said.* \"*It will be difficult, though not impossible, to hide the evidence of your past, but it helps that you and Akiyama‐san were always so secretive.*\"

*She paused, tapping her fingers on her lips.*

\"*The truth is, I knew this was coming,*\" *she said.* \"*I was warned that this is what you would propose. Ordinarily, I would fight this harder, but She is mysterious in her ways, as one might say.*\"

\"*Your Goddess?*\" *Mami asked, though she knew quite well who Homura meant.*

*Homura didn\'t answer, instead sitting back down in the seat across from Mami, ducking her head as if deep in thought.*

\"*Have you thought of a trigger to place, for releasing the memories?*\" *Homura asked.* \"*Sometimes it\'s a good idea, as long as it\'s not something that can be accidentally released by anyone in particular.*\"

*Mami shook her head.*

\"*I\'d rather not think about it in that much detail.*\"

\"*I wouldn\'t want it to be something anyone could trigger,*\" *Homura said thoughtfully.* \"*I\'d want it to be something only one of us could release, something magical.*\"

\"*I guess I would know how to do that. It may not ever matter anyway, since the process will eventually decay.*\"

\"*What* is *the process, anyway?*\" *Homura asked.*

\"*Well...*\"

*Before Mami could say anything, a small white form started to appear on the table in front of them, and before the Incubator could even begin to say anything, Mami had already picked it up by the neck.*

\"*Did you know, you little weasel?*\" *she demanded.*

We know nothing about whatever it is you think you saw, *Kyubey thought.* Nor are we aware of this metamorphosis Akemi Homura says exists. I was just here to give consolations for your loss.

\"*You? Consolations?*\"

\"*Let it go, Mami,*\" *Homura said.* \"*Actually, I\'ve been meaning to talk to you, Incubator.*\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami opened her eyes with a start, keeling forward onto the table, and into Azrael\'s waiting arms. Azrael\'s eyes were wide, as if she had seen a ghost, but not as wide as Mami\'s.

*What the hell was **that**?* Machina thought, doing the equivalent of screaming into Mami\'s mind. *I should never have let you do this. Are you alright? Oh geez I need to review these memories...*

\"*Are* you alright?\" Azrael asked, picking up Machina\'s thoughts from their now‐fading telepathic connection. \"I tried to back out of the connection once your memories started coming back, but it wasn\'t easy. It will be alright.\"

That last sentence was directed at the way Mami clung to the other girl\'s shoulders, an awkward embrace considering Mami\'s larger physique.

With force of will, Mami pushed herself away, looking at her hands. The recovered memories felt raw and fresh, as if they had just happened, more real even than what *had* just happened. In the wake of it all, she felt it all again: the painful emptiness of loss, the despair of knowing what lay in the pit of darkness in a soul gem.

Yet somehow it didn\'t seem as world‐ending as it once had.

So she had killed four girls in relatively cold blood, and lost someone she had loved, and seen terrible truth. But she had killed others since then, had lost friends, and seen truths that were in many ways just as bad. Her heart was harder now.

She wasn\'t sure whether to be glad.

*It is as we predicted,* Kyubey thought across the room, materializing on top of a piece of modular furniture they weren\'t using.

Azrael jerked backwards in surprise, but Mami only tilted her head slightly. She felt a little too numb to really be surprised by anything anymore.

\"It\'s rare for you to leave Earth,\" Mami said.

*I followed you here,* Kyubey thought, jumping onto the carpet. *It was very important to us that we monitor how you handled this particular situation. This was both because of the information‐gathering value and because we were concerned for your well‐being.*

\"Concern? How touching,\" Mami said, with more sarcasm than she had used in years. She realized that with the lost memories had gone a piece of her personality. She had once been less... mild.

*Indeed,* Kyubey thought, unperturbed. *After all, you are a key asset to us, and you yourself asked us to monitor you until this time came, as you surely remember now.*

\"I do,\" Mami said softly. It had been Homura\'s idea, even though neither of them would have trusted Kyubey farther than they could throw him, even if that was admittedly quite a distance.

\"What are you going to do now?\" Azrael said, eyes shifting uneasily between the Incubator and the field marshal.

Mami didn\'t respond, head swimming for a moment with the need to reconcile her thoughts and emotions from centuries past with her thoughts and emotions now. Azrael was right---there were many things to do, many topics to tackle.

She let out a breath.

\"I\'m going to build a memorial to the dead,\" she said. \"Somewhere. I\'m rich enough to make it as grand as I like, but Akari would have preferred something simple. But before that, I have some questions to answer, and people to talk to.\"

*Sakura Kyouko?* Kyubey suggested helpfully.

\"Yes,\" Mami said. \"But there is someone else that I can meet right here.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko didn\'t really know what to expect when she and Asami were abruptly summoned to meet with Mami again, with frustratingly inconvenient timing and urgency that sent them both scrambling to get ready. Was there some kind of emergency on the front? Was there an important surprise meeting with a member of the Directorate that they needed to attend? Did it have something to do with why Azrael was here? They couldn\'t help but speculate.

In the end, Azrael herself arrived at their doorway to escort them, looking as ill at ease as they had ever seen her and remarkably recalcitrant about why they were being called.

Thus it was that Ryouko found herself once again nervously facing one of the most powerful women alive, watching Azrael lean against the wall to try to hide the way her back spines were twitching. Whatever it was, it did not look good. Mami had even forgotten the tea.

Ryouko used the long moment of silence to look at Mami\'s expression and try to read what the situation was. The Field Marshal looked... different somehow, and distant, unlike the warmly‐welcoming archetype they were used to. Beyond that, she couldn\'t tell.

\"You reported that you had a religious experience, shortly before you reopened the wormhole and sent the Cephalopod ambush fleet back at Orpheus,\" Mami said, with no preamble.

Ryouko could feel her eyes widen with shock.

\"I never put it that way,\" she began, pausing for a fraction of a second to think.

\"But you don\'t deny it,\" Mami interrupted. \"After all, it\'s what your squadmates claimed.\"

Ryouko avoided eye contact, looking at Asami, then at Azrael, hoping one of them might help her out.

*She\'s asked you about this before,* Clarisse thought darkly.

*She has?* Ryouko asked.

*In a dream state debriefing,* Clarisse thought. *It\'s obvious something is up, but I never got around to telling you. Earlier, while we were meeting with her and the Director, Machina warned me that Mami was in a potentially unstable state, and that she might need my help. I...*

She paused.

*What? What is it?* Ryouko thought, when Clarisse didn\'t continue, feeling Mami\'s pointed look on her.

*Machina wants you to tell the truth,* she said. *She says it\'s very important, though she won\'t tell me why.*

\"I\'m not speaking on behalf of Governance or the MSY,\" Mami said. \"I have my own reasons for wanting to know what you really experienced. I have had... many friends die on me, and this aging heart wonders whether, in the end, Homura and Kyouko are right about all they\'ve said.\"

Ryouko couldn\'t help but look in Mami\'s eyes then, finding a beseeching, mournful look she didn\'t recognize.

*I think you should do it,* Clarisse thought.

*I think you\'re right,* Ryouko thought, *but that doesn\'t make this easy.*

She sucked in a breath, casting the smallest of glances at Asami, who was watching her quietly to see what she would do.

She ducked her head, because it seemed like the right thing to do.

\"It is true, what I said officially, that I had a vivid flashback of a physics lecture, and learned how my power worked, but I left out most of what happened after that,\" she said. \"After the original flashback, I... was spoken to personally by an entity I\'ve met before, the one Kyouko and Homura call the Goddess. I realized on my own that I could use my teleportation to escape from the moon, but it was she who gave me the idea to reopen the wormhole and send the enemy fleet back. I was given... a number of visions, so I could understand the military situation and why there was an emergency. I\'m not sure what else I should say.\"

She took a breath and looked back up, wondering what Mami\'s reaction would be.

The woman looked thoughtful, though Ryouko thought she saw her hand shake a little where it lay on the table.

\"It wasn\'t the only time you\'ve had a vision like this, right?\" Mami asked. \"There was also the one that made Kyouko insist on abandoning the submarine plan at X‐25.\"

Ryouko glanced at Asami, then at Azrael. Asami wore an expression of concern, while Azrael looked rather thoughtful.

\"Yes,\" Ryouko said.

She wasn\'t sure how to continue, but was surprised when Asami stepped in to fill the gap.

\"I\'ve had one too,\" Asami said, bowing her head seemingly instinctively. \"It wasn\'t as important as either of Ryouko‐chan\'s, but I can verify that someone like the Goddess exists.\"

\"But after all of this, neither of you have elected to join Kyouko\'s cult?\" Mami asked.

\"I don\'t know that I want to tie myself down into all that theology,\" Ryouko said, for once having already thought about what she would want to say. \"I prefer to think about these things myself, for now.\"

There was a long silence while Mami closed her eyes, hair curls bobbing up and down just a little, until Ryouko wondered if she should say anything further.

\"Thank you for your time,\" Mami said, before she could. \"I think I\'ve asked all I want to ask for now.\"

It was a clear start to dismissing the conversation, but Ryouko asked:

\"If you don\'t mind my asking, why did you suddenly want to know?\"

To her surprise, Mami smiled.

\"I just wanted to make sure I understood things,\" she said. \"I\'m sorry, it\'s rude of me, but I\'d rather not share more than that.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami watched the door slide closed behind the two departing magical girls, then said out loud:

\"I know you\'re still listening, Incubator. What do you make of all this?\"

*It is very intriguing, Tomoe Mami,* Kyubey thought, appearing on the ground next to Azrael. *Strictly speaking, many of the things discussed violate physical laws, particularly the conservation of information. Of course, magic is all about violating that particular physical law, so I can\'t say it\'s impossible at all.*

\"Cagey as always, Kyubey,\" Mami said.

\"What do you intend to do now?\" Azrael asked.

*I have the same question,* Kyubey added.

\"I need to visit Earth,\" Mami said. \"Certain magical entities, real or not, have a lot to answer for.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Careful, careful...*\" Vlad repeated unnecessarily.

If Asami\'s forehead wrinkled any further, it might never unwrinkle, Ryouko thought to herself. It seemed almost unfair, that she could just stand and watch while Asami struggled to stabilize the wormhole Ryouko had left behind while teleporting.

Well, \"stand\" was an inaccuracy. It was more that she had braced herself into a corner as she watched Asami float in the gravity‐free room, hands hovering over an apparition of purple and black like she was manipulating a sorcerer\'s orb.

The \"orb\" itself resembled an odd amalgamation of the singularity Asami wielded in battle, the squid wormhole, and a multi‐spectral light show. It oscillated wildly back and forth, emitting light chaotic in every frequency, turbulent around a dark, black hole heart.

Around them, she could hear machinery humming, and glowing blue motes of exotic matter floated in a small swirl around Asami, barely kept in containment by the gravity generators and Asami herself, so unstable otherwise that both their soul gems were being kept in a shielded container outside the room, just in case.

She fed the motes into the orb slowly, one by one, with an intensity Ryouko found oddly mesmerizing to watch, both with regards to the metaphysical display of magic and science, and the sheer focus which Asami was applying to the task, undistracted by any of the equipment she was wearing. She supposed it was only natural that Asami would feel at home in a vacuum suit, given her training.

But only a moment later the orb collapsed, motes of exotic matter spinning outward, only barely avoiding Asami herself.

Asami stayed focused a few seconds longer, helping shepherd them back safely into a collector in the center of the ceiling, before slumping down slightly and letting out a long, frustrated noise.

\"*It\'s alright,*\" Vlad said, voice transmitted directly into their heads. \"*This is far more progress than I ever expected in only a few days. We can take a break.*\"

By which he meant, of course, that Asami could take a break. They shuffled over to the airlock, and Ryouko grabbed the other girl by the shoulder as the air streamed in.

\"There\'s no rush,\" she said, voice muffled in the low‐pressure atmosphere.

\"The sooner we figure this out, the sooner we can be out of this station,\" Asami said. \"I know you don\'t like being here.\"

\"It\'s alright for now,\" Ryouko said, shaking her head. \"These experiments are pretty immersive.\"

\"For now,\" Asami repeated skeptically.

A moment later their suits began to drop off, helmet unhinging off the top as the various pieces released their locks and began to separate, working their way off before dropping to the floor, each one collected adroitly by small worker drones that skittered off as they watched.

The opposing door unlocked shortly after.

They found Azrael on the other side, leaning sideways against the wall with arms crossed and---much to their surprise---wings tucked behind her back. Eri and Elanis stood vaguely awkwardly by her side, obviously nonplussed by the rainbow‐colored feathers.

*I\'m just letting everyone assume it\'s a magical girl thing,* Azrael thought, answering the unspoken question.

\"Were you watching?\" Asami asked.

Azrael nodded.

Ryouko had been surprised to still see her around after Mami left. She had assumed that Azrael would be gone shortly thereafter, but apparently Mami had left her there to \"keep an eye on them\", whatever that meant.

\"So you\'ve been briefed on what this is all about?\" Ryouko asked.

\"Generally speaking,\" Azrael said, making a vague shrugging motion. "Do you know what the value of a long‐range teleportation would even be*? Or are you not allowed to say?\"

\"It\'s not so much that I\'m not allowed to say as I don\'t really know,\" Ryouko said. \"We\'re just waiting to see how it turns out.\"

Azrael made an affirming noise, seemingly unsurprised by what had been said.

As Azrael stood there, apparently trying to decide what to say, Ryouko became abruptly aware that they had been standing idly in the hallway, without obvious purpose.

\"Well, anyway,\" Azrael said, rubbing the back of her head with one hand. \"I\'ve heard something about the reasons why you\'re here, and now that I\'m here too, Mami and I agree that it\'d be a good idea for me to talk to you.\"

\"Why I\'m here...\" Ryouko echoed emptily, buying time to think through what Azrael meant.

*The genetic modifications,* Azrael thought, letting the thought broadcast to Asami and her bodyguards as well. *I\'m not sure if Vlad is in the know, so...*

*Oh.*

Ryouko looked the other girl in the eyes, remembering then how she and Asami had felt quietly sorry for Azrael when they first met her, what seemed like so long ago on their way to the planet San Giuseppe. There was still plenty to feel sorry about, but it occurred to her for the first time that they had something in common now.

She realized, too, that she had come to see Azrael not as some kind of freak, but only as a bit of an idiosyncratic loner, who just happened to have spines on her back and be able to fly. She had heard of magical girls who had radically inhuman secondary forms... in the end, what difference did it make whether the spines had originated from magic, or genetic manipulation?

And yet one was readily accepted everywhere, while the other had to be kept secret at all cost.

\"Let\'s get some dinner then,\" Azrael offered. \"We can go to my room.\"

There was an awkward moment as the group exchanged glances, and it became clear she didn\'t mean for Eri or Elanis to be involved. Their status had become somewhat murkier in recent days---without anything to really guard against, the expectation that they always lurk in Ryouko\'s vicinity without actually being her friend conflicted with everyone\'s social instincts. Ryouko felt guilty, since it was obvious they felt left out, the strange mixture of power relationships and responsibilities combining dissonantly.

At least they\'d stopped fighting with each other, Ryouko thought as they walked down the corridor, the two girls following at a respectful distance. They just felt so much *younger* than Ryouko or Asami, despite being approximately the same age.

\"I would have invited them,\" Azrael said, almost the exact instant the door closed behind them, \"but I wanted to talk in private. It\'s obvious they\'re supposed to be keeping you company. Maybe we can do a tea and cakes thing or something later.\"

Ryouko nodded vaguely. She was surprised to see that Azrael\'s room was not any worse in its amenities than Mami\'s had been, and indeed even seemed a bit larger than that, but the point of that became obvious when Azrael unfurled her wings fully, her presence immediately dominating the room.

Before Ryouko had even managed to react, Asami was next to the wings, peering intently.

\"Can I touch it?\" she asked.

\"Ah, sure,\" Azrael said, nonplussed.

Ryouko took a seat as she watched Asami stare intently at a feather. She felt a pang, remembering how she had once envied her friends in school for having topics that truly fascinated them.

\"Who made these?\" Asami asked. \"They seem very similar to bird feathers I\'ve seen, and I know they\'re artificial.\"

Azrael looked uncomfortable, closing her eyes.

\"It was a gift from one of the other survivors of the colony,\" she said, just as Asami was about to apologize for asking. \"I only had one pair myself, but the others weren\'t ever going to use theirs again, so I kept them. I don\'t usually wear the rainbow one, but I like to do it occasionally in memory. Aurelia never really had great taste in color.\"

She paused for a moment, then sat down onto the floor, angling her body so that she leaned back onto her wings, using them to brace herself against the floor. It looked awkward, to Ryouko\'s eyes.

\"It\'s actually easier for me to sit this way than it is in a chair, even with the wings off,\" Azrael said. \"I always have to kind of hunch over to avoid aggravating the spines. Back in my colony, we used to have specially‐shaped chairs that worked for us, but now I have to either get my own, or live somewhere with self‐shaping furniture.\"

\"Isn\'t that what we have here, though?\" Asami said, purposefully sitting in a chair that had just been assembled.

\"Yeah, I just wanted to make the point,\" Azrael said. \"The founders thought about redesigning us so we would be comfortable perching, like birds, but most of us thought that was unnecessary.\"

They were silent for a moment, Azrael\'s seemingly odd choice of topic weighing down on the conversation. It was obvious she wasn\'t done, that the topic was meant to *lead* somewhere.

Azrael smiled vaguely.

\"Okay, so I\'ll be honest, this is kind of a difficult conversation for me. Mami summoned me here because I\'m a telepath, and then asked me to talk to you about your genetic modifications, I suppose because I myself am genetically modified, at least relative to most humans. I... honestly don\'t think that really makes sense, since I was born among people who were the same as me, and was forced to join a society with different people. It\'s not really the same situation.\"

Ryouko wasn\'t sure what to say, and settled instead for shifting uneasily. She had thought about Azrael\'s \"condition\" relative to her own already, and had reached much the same conclusion. Azrael\'s life was objectively harder than hers, but at least she had the assurance that her own brain wasn\'t part of some elaborate conspiracy. Ryouko was, if anything, assured of the opposite.

\"How did you cope, then?\" Ryouko asked, swallowing her misgivings in order to ask the question. \"I know you said the situation isn\'t really the same, but I think it\'d still be useful to hear.\"

\"That\'s what Mami said, too,\" Azrael said, her eyes taking on a briefly distant look. \"I guess I can see the logic behind that.\"

She put her hands on the table.

\"Let\'s do it this way, I think. I\'ll tell you about how I tried to cope, and then you can tell me about any problems you\'ve been having. Does that make sense to you?\"

Ryouko nodded. It seemed like a bloodless way of approaching the problem, but she suspected neither she nor Azrael really had a better idea for the matter.

\"It might seem a bit of a tangent, but what I came to realize in the years after my wish was that there is a very important difference between what everyone says they believe, and what they actually believe.\"

She stopped, weighing her next words carefully.

\"For example, the radicals in my colony always said that they believed the existing leadership was too conservative, that they were too tied to the existing human form and didn\'t really believe in the cause. They probably did believe that, but what they were really worried about was something else.\"

She took a meaningful breath, and spoke methodically, casting her eyes between the two of them.

\"I studied the files Governance was able to recover from the colony, because I was responsible for helping the sociologists understand what had gone wrong. Of course, the whole idea was that Governance would eventually find us, and that our example would drive a change in ideology. Idealistic, but we knew, somehow, that Governance often let pacifist rogue colonies stay in place, and would even provide some minor support, in exchange for allowing some monitoring to stay in place. That was an acceptable alternative. But...\"

She gathered her thoughts.

\"Many of the radicals controlled the production and trade of essential goods, things we were in short supply of,\" she continued. \"They were afraid the leadership would make contact and ruin their livelihoods, and they were antagonistic to the idea of Governance finding us.\"

\"So your colony was blown up because of greed and a power struggle,\" Asami said, with a hint of distaste Ryouko knew meant much more than that. \"How stupid.\"

\"That\'s a big oversimplification,\" Azrael said. \"There were many factions, and this was just one reason. But, it was a reason.\"

She tilted her head, smiling.

\"In a way, that\'s human nature,\" Azrael said. \"And while Governance has tried, and claims, to be better than that, there are many ways it is the same. For example, ironically, on the topic of human modification.\"

She paused dramatically, making sure the others heard what she had said, before continuing:

\"Governance says that it believes the human form is something we should cherish and hold onto as the legacy of those who came before us, and for this reason it claims that it suppresses the most radical human modifications. I won\'t try to judge just how committed they are to that argument, and I certainly concede most Governance Representatives seem to believe what they are saying. That being said, I have had the occasion to see first‐hand how Governance treats rogue colonies and genetic modification, and I\'ve reached the conclusion Governance really doesn\'t care as much as they say they do.\"

She let that sentence hang in the air for a moment, then continued.

\"Our leaders were right, partly: Governance is perfectly happy to let a rogue colony of modified humans live in peace. They were also wrong, because Governance would never tolerate anyone in the main colonies ever finding out about it. Part of it is balancing ideology with pragmatism, in case some disaster occurs to normal humans. Part of it is the simple calculation that a population that is genetically similar is a population that is easier to predict and easier to control. Even with all its simulations and surveillance, Governance knows it can\'t control all the variables, so it does what it can to keep the number of variables low. Even if it\'s just a membrane over the eyes.\"

To accentuate her point, she slid closed the inner, nictating membrane of her eyes, casting them in a cloudy, almost alien yellow.

Ryouko couldn\'t help but feel oddly uneasy about what Azrael was saying, and, looking over, she could see that Asami was as well. It certainly struck her that Azrael was hardly a disinterested party in this particular line of thought, and that she had presented no real evidence for anything she had said, except for an assertion about Governance policy she conceded had another explanation.

\"So what exactly are you saying?\" Ryouko asked, deciding not to challenge Azrael\'s assertions directly. \"I\'m sorry to be too direct about this, but what does this have to do with how you coped with everything?\"

Azrael looked taken aback, then spoke carefully:

\"To me, the first step to handling my situation, even to some degree, was simply understanding. It gave me some solace to know why everything had happened to me, and who was responsible, given that they were all dead and there was no one to get revenge on. And, you know, it helped me feel better about the devil\'s deal I made with Governance, to know exactly why they behave the way they do. Rationally, it is difficult to be angry at them, when they behaved better than your own leaders did.\"

\"You could argue that if it weren\'t for Governance policy, your parents would never have been forced to leave in the first place,\" Asami commented, rather insensitively in Ryouko\'s opinion.

\"I know, but then I would never have been born,\" Azrael said, with a hint of a smile. \"It\'s hard to be angry about something like that.\"

She said it jokingly, but her voice was distant, and Ryouko sensed that she didn\'t really mean it. She wondered if Azrael was really as over it as she seemed to be trying to project.

*Maybe she wants to convince herself as much as she wants to convince you,* Clarisse thought.

Azrael shook her head at herself.

\"This sounded a lot more coherent in my head. What I\'m trying to say is, I\'ve come to realize that there is no one really worth blaming, and I\'m more the victim of circumstance than anything. We all are, even people like Mami, or Governance itself. No matter how much power we get, there are too many variables. Maybe only the Incubators are immune.\"

She spread her wings outward slightly, before closing them again.

\"In the end I decided that there was no sense getting stuck worrying about what happened in the past, and what I can\'t change. It\'s better to focus on what I can change, and what I can do in the future. Or at least, that\'s what I\'ve tried to decide, but actually doing it in practice is... well, it\'s harder.\"

She looked subdued for a moment, and it seemed to Ryouko that she needed to say something, or at least ask a question.

\"So what did you do then?\" Ryouko asked. \"What did you change?\"

\"I asked for more freedom,\" Azrael said. \"A place of my own, somewhere where I could fly, and longer breaks. I asked to be able to show my wings more, as long as I told people I was a magical girl. I pointed out that just because I had made a deal didn\'t mean Governance could use me like an indentured servant. It\'s their own ideology. After all, I know that Governance considers me human, because they consider AIs human. It makes no sense to worry so much about form, when so many of their constituents *have* no form. And they gave it to me, just because I asked.\"

Azrael\'s expression seemed briefly so wistful, and happy, that Ryouko couldn\'t help but want to ask, but Azrael answered the question before it was even posed, and this time Ryouko doubted it was telepathy.

\"I was so happy, if you can understand it,\" she said. \"In the end, the chains were in my own heart. I don\'t even blame Governance, or the MHD. I can see now that they thought I could only find consolation in my work, and that it was perhaps better for me to stay on the job, until I found peace somehow. I don\'t have peace, but I have... something.\"

Ryouko realized then, that somehow Azrael had ended up talking about something other than just body modification and mysterious brain parts. Instead, there was something deeper here, something about Azrael\'s life itself.

She glanced at Asami, who had her forehead furrowed in thought at something. She had noticed it too, she thought.

\"Given what you\'ve said, then, what do you suggest I do?\" Ryouko asked, perhaps the most straightforward question she could muster.

Azrael, who had leaned forward over the course of her previous statements, sat back, and it was clear that she had failed to expect the question, lost instead in her own past.

\"Well, the mystery brain part is certainly a problem, isn\'t it?\" Azrael said. \"At least I don\'t have to worry that my wings are going to up and betray me.\"

Azrael\'s hair trembled slightly, waving behind her, and it occurred to Ryouko for the first time that it, too, was different from the generic human version, seeming to have even more fine control than usual.

\"That was really two different questions, wasn\'t it?\" Azrael pointed out. \"On the one hand, there\'s the narrow question of what to do about the thing in your head, and I don\'t think *anyone* knows what to do about that, other than wait a bit longer for results to come in, and keep you around in case of further study.\"

She paused meaningfully, catching Ryouko\'s eye.

\"But I sense you\'re also asking about something more general,\" she said. \"Not just what to do about the modifications, but what to do, period. Am I right?\"

Ryouko nodded, carefully, wondering if Azrael was using her telepathy or not.

\"I think Governance, and the other interested parties, are as conflicted about you as they were about me, perhaps even more so,\" Azrael said. \"I doubt anyone ever anticipated not even being able to know what the modification is for, and in that case every decision is potentially unethical. They can\'t remove it without risking hurting you, can\'t let you get involved in anything important without risking important secrets, can\'t keep it secret without breaching your self‐determination, can\'t tell you without risking your stability. It\'s stormy skies to navigate, and it\'s not surprising they chose to isolate you somewhere remote.\"

\"They still let me see this top secret research lab,\" Ryouko said, "and they let me close to Mami.\"

\"I doubt anyone anticipated what Mami would do,\" Azrael said dryly. "But yes, it seems some people aren\'t as worried about the thing in your brain as others, which is an interesting observation in and of itself.\"

\"Your soul gem did grow it back in the new body,\" Asami said. \"Like they said, that\'s strong evidence the modifications aren\'t actually that malicious.\"

\"Yes, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s necessarily doing something you\'d want it to do,\" Azrael replied.

She looked thoughtful abruptly, as if something had just occurred to her.

\"Anyway, that\'s not where I was going with this,\" she concluded finally, even as Ryouko was still deciding whether to press her for her thoughts. \"What I was trying to say is that, like me, you may be overestimating the certainty of the players involved. Maybe all it takes is for you to express a strong opinion about what you want. It\'s a lot less moral keeping a prisoner who doesn\'t want to be in their prison, after all.\"

Azrael\'s words hung in the air there, as Asami nodded silently, putting pressure on Ryouko to say something. It made sense, of course. Ryouko was only here because Mami had assigned her here, and that in itself was a measure to mollify those who wanted to keep her safely isolated. Expressing her opinion might very well shift the weight on such a vague set of motives, as Azrael suggested. But...

\"It\'s difficult to know what you want, isn\'t it?\" Azrael prompted. "Obviously, I can\'t answer that question for you, and it\'s not exactly an easy question. But everything starts with that. In this modern world, it\'s pretty much the only question the government and powers‐that‐be don\'t answer for you. And I think we\'d all much prefer they don\'t try. So what do you want?\"

Ryouko had been anticipating the question, but still hadn\'t composed a particularly good answer. She could feel the eyes of the others on her.

\"Like everyone else, I\'d like to know what is going on with what\'s in my head,\" Ryouko said. \"Even if it\'s terrifying, I\'d like to know so we could at least try to remove it. In the worst case scenario, they could always move my soul gem to a new body and try to prevent it from regrowing. Maybe talk to someone capable of manipulating souls, if there even is someone like that.\"

She looked around at the others, to make sure she hadn\'t said anything too ridiculous. She found Asami making an expression of concern, but couldn\'t tell if something was really wrong.

Nonetheless, she finished:

\"But I can\'t exactly make that go any faster. About the only thing I can* do is make sure I\'m available for further study if necessary, which is something that ties me down. Beyond that...\"

She gestured vaguely at the station around them.

\"I\'d also like to see this whole thing through. I\'d like to know what Asami and I are capable of, and what exactly my wish has set me up for. I don\'t think it was just to save the Euphratic Campaign, as big a deal as that was. I have to think that, with all the coincidences and conspiracies going around, something else is going on.\"

\"So you\'re happy staying here on this station?\" Azrael asked.

\"I didn\'t say that,\" Ryouko said, knowing that Azrael had meant the question rhetorically. \"But it makes *sense*, for now. I just don\'t know what to do with what we find, or worse, if we find nothing. When is it time to complain? When is it time to ask to go somewhere else? What if Mami comes up with some other plan for me?\"

She had gotten carried away in her sentence, but snapped back abruptly, blinking as she looked Azrael in the eyes. She didn\'t know if anything she had said was *useful*.

Instead of responding right away, Azrael was quiet, almost thoughtful, and when she spoke again, it was softly.

\"Well, in the past I\'ve found that when one is uncertain about where to go in life, it is worth thinking back to when you were happy, and what *made* you happy. Me, I realized that my happiest moments were when I was alone, soaring through the skies of some alien world, and that\'s driven a lot of my decision‐making since. I haven\'t figured out yet whether the alone part is important to that or not, but it at least gave me something to focus on.\"

Ryouko closed her eyes at that remark. She knew, in retrospect, when she had felt happiest, and the most engaged, even if she hadn\'t realized it at the time. She just wasn\'t sure if she should say it.

\"You\'re going to say you were happier when going on missions, aren\'t you?\" Asami said, in a voice so subtle that Ryouko didn\'t even immediately realize that she had said something relevant.

Ryouko looked back at Asami, their eyes making contact. The sensation she felt was less one of surprise at her girlfriend\'s insight, and more one of paradoxical relief. It was the kind of relief that came with knowing that a long pretense, hitherto maintained only awkwardly, was no longer necessary.

\"Pretty much, yeah,\" she conceded. \"I don\'t know; I\'ve had a long time to think about it, and I still don\'t know exactly why it is, but something about the missions I\'ve been on, the things I was doing, made me feel like I was achieving something. Here, I feel like I\'m always in a holding pattern, waiting for something to arrive, and even with supposedly unlimited time, it feels wrong, somehow.\"

\"I knew this day would come,\" Asami said, shaking her head sadly. \"We both know I would be lying if I said I understood where you were coming from, but it\'s your choice.\"

\"What day do you mean?\" Ryouko asked. \"I\'m just stating what moments I thought I was happiest. I haven\'t committed to anything else.\"

\"But if something like that is when you\'re happiest, is there really any doubt you\'ll go back eventually?\" Azrael said, face carefully neutral. \"After all, in our immortal lives, what purpose is there but satisfaction with what you\'re doing?\"

\"That\'s just it,\" Ryouko said, shaking her head as well. \"Everyone always talks like eternity is guaranteed, but it *isn\'t*. The Cephalopods could be on the verge of wiping out everyone, but we all sit around like we\'re living in a dream, discussing what idle pursuit we want to engage in for the next few decades. How could I ever settle down like that, knowing what\'s out there? Knowing that I could help?\"

She stopped abruptly, realizing she was holding her arm up in the air awkwardly, and dropped it a moment later, embarrassed.

\"It\'s the only topic I\'ve ever seen you really engaged by,\" Asami said, expression unreadable. \"I know you feel empty of achievement most of the time, and the part of me that wants you to be happy conflicts with the part that wants you safe.\"

\"Is that really what it is, though?\" Azrael asked, folding her wings habitually. \"Not everyone contributes by being in combat. The case is easily made---has been made---that you\'re more valuable doing this research than just being another combat teleporter. It\'s not as simple as that.\"

Ryouko closed her eyes for a moment, feeling the truth of those words. Yes, it was true, she felt more engaged by the war than by anything else, but she never felt herself motivated by anything so selfless as a desire to save humanity. When she thought back, she remembered the ecstasy of saving her team, the simple happiness of seeing Sacnite rescued, the pleading eyes of the teenage Goddess on her.

And she remembered violently killing the squid that had dared kill her teammate.

\"No, that\'s not the only reason,\" she said. \"But what can I say? That I don\'t really understand the other reasons? That I worry now the other reasons only exist because of the modifications someone made to me? How can I trust my own motivations anymore?\"

\"And I love flying, even though I know one of the colony\'s scientists built that into me,\" Azrael said. \"The sensation of wind on my face, soaring on the powerful breath of a thermal...\"

She let her voice trail off, before continuing.

\"I would say that, whatever modifications were made to your personality, they are something you can only embrace. If someone is controlling or influencing you, then yes, you are right to be worried, but if you only enjoy combat, then that is a part of you, even if that was placed in you by an external actor. What are you supposed to do, change it back? That\'s what Governance did to my friends from my colony, and I wouldn\'t wish it on my worst enemy.\"

A long silence followed that statement, and then Ryouko said:

\"So what am I supposed to do? Try to volunteer to go back into combat? Even if I could leave, I have others to think about.\"

She glanced at Asami quickly, who met the gaze for as long as it lasted. She had been vague, but it was clear who she had mainly meant.

\"Maybe not combat, per se,\" Azrael said. \"Maybe something a bit more restricted than that. You\'re hardly the first to have to face questions like this.\"

\"The good news on that front, at least, is that you may not be here for too much longer,\" Director Vladimir Volokhov said, hologram materializing just in front of the doorway to the room.

\"Do you make a habit of spying on all your guests?\" Azrael asked, with more than a trace of annoyance. \"This was obviously a private conversation. That\'s a bit rude, don\'t you think?\"

\"I just got here,\" Vlad said, \"and this *is* a top‐secret, secure facility. I have subsentient algorithms combing my sensors constantly for information I need to know. The rest is deleted immediately, I assure you. I wouldn\'t lie about that.\"

\"Very trustworthy,\" Azrael said sarcastically.

\"Anyway, there\'s been a development,\" Vlad said briskly. \"And I thought this was just a good moment to point it out. We have a visitor.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"You know, I didn\'t want to bring it up because it seemed disrespectful, but I made a big exception for you.\"

\"I know, Kyouko,\" Mami said.

\"It\'s weird hearing you call me that, but I guess...\"

Kyouko\'s voice trailed off, leaving the sentence unfinished.

If there was a phrase to summarize the current situation, it was "better than expected\". Mami\'s initial message---simply \"I remember\"---had brought her to a level of horror she hadn\'t thought still possible at her age.

She and Yuma had convened and hurriedly game‐planned for all kinds of outré scenarios, in conversations that seemed downright panicked and delirious in retrospect. Mami was fine, for certain values of fine. Those certain values were usually good enough for the MHD, and they were good enough for Kyouko here.

\"So why did you decide to tell me you made an exception if it would seem disrespectful?\" Mami asked, looking at Kyouko out of the corner of her eye.

Kyouko let out a breath, glancing over their surroundings to delay having to respond. There wasn\'t much to see, really. They were in a small side annex of the main Ribbon Chamber, which had been closed down for \"renovations\"---the exception she had spoken of earlier. Entering via the auxiliary entrances attracted less attention, but there really wasn\'t anything to see other than dark wooden walls and a few muted portraits.

\"To be honest, I\'m just trying to talk to you,\" Kyouko said. "You\'ve barely said anything meaningful since you got here, and here we are waiting for you to open the door, and all you\'re doing is just standing* there. I don\'t want to disrespect how big a deal this must be for you, but if you\'re hurting, I want to talk to you. You never gave us the chance to, the first time.\"

Not until she said it out loud did she realize how much that had bothered her, as irrational a concern as it seemed, given that it was Mami\'s feelings, not hers, at stake.

Mami\'s shoulders slumped slightly, and it occurred to Kyouko that she recognized the expression, even if she had never seen it on Mami. It was a curious mixture of tired but determined, lonely but self‐assured, that usually bespoke someone doing their best to survive in the wake of loss. She remembered seeing its like most frequently after New Athens, and at various times during the Unification Wars. All too frequently Mami had been on the other side of that conversation, the warm heart of the MSY comforting the bereaved.

\"I\'ll be alright,\" Mami said. \"Back then I wasn\'t ready. I don\'t think one can ever really be ready, but at least I\'m not self‐destructive and...\"

She shook her head slightly, long hair ruffling on her shoulders, filling Kyouko with an indescribable sense of... oddness, that Mami would choose to abandon such an iconic hairstyle in public, even for something as understandable as mourning.

\"Thank you for taking care of me all these years,\" Mami said. \"It can\'t have been easy, walking on eggshells. I realize now that the rest of you were always watching, just in case.\"

\"It\'s what friends are for, after all,\" Kyouko said, realizing how incredibly pithy she sounded. She meant it, though.

\"I can\'t help but feel even more guilt now, about Homura,\" Mami said, looking at Kyouko and revealing a sad smile that shook her. \"Funny, isn\'t it, that at a time like this, I can\'t help but remember about how we let her down?\"

Kyouko looked up evocatively at the ceiling, one of those vaguely priestly gestures she had picked up over the years.

\"No, not really,\" she said. \"It makes perfect sense. I think anyone who has lost someone they were taking care of knows how that works.\"

They shared a moment of silence after that comment, a charged silence whose meaning they both understood.

\"In my mind I always imagined you making fun of me if I ever came here, after all those years of talking down on it,\" Mami said. \"That seems silly in retrospect.\"

\"I would never do that,\" Kyouko said, trying, and failing, to make eye contact with the other girl. \"Everyone who chooses to come here has their own path, and their own reasons. I wouldn\'t have very much faith in my deity if I disrespected those reasons, would I?\"

She paused, weighing her next words much more carefully than a younger Kyouko would have ever bothered to.

\"That being said, I\'d be lying if I pretended I had no interest in what changed your mind so suddenly. I mean, I guess it\'s kind of obvious, but I don\'t see how remembering what... happened changes anything. Are you here to seek more meaning?\"

\"I\'m here because I remembered the conversation I had with Homura just before the memory wipe,\" Mami said, almost curtly. \"That should explain enough, I think.\"

\"She told you something?\" Kyouko asked incredulously, barely biting back the natural \"What did she tell you?\".

\"Maybe later,\" Mami said. \"To tell the truth, I did have a question I wanted to ask you.\"

Mami reached forward to the old‐fashioned door, pausing before turning the knob.

\"Yes?\" Kyouko asked.

\"The seal on my memories didn\'t start to come apart naturally,\" she said. \"I designed it myself, and it was getting old and worn out, but nonetheless, someone released it, and recently. There are only a few people who are supposed to know how to do that.\"

\"It wasn\'t me,\" Kyouko denied automatically, feeling uncomfortable under Mami\'s gaze. \"And I\'m pretty sure it wasn\'t Yuma. You should have seen us panicking...\"

Her voice trailed off, as she realized what the implications would be. There was only one other person who would know how to unlock the seal, and she was supposed to be missing, or dead.

\"Are you sure?\" she asked Mami, because she had to.

\"Yes, absolutely,\" Mami said. \"Are you sure Yuma didn\'t do it without you knowing?\"

\"Even if I thought she was lying, I have no idea why she would,\" Kyouko said.

Mami closed her eyes, shaking her head.

\"It\'s a bit much to think about. Let\'s get this over with.\"

She turned the doorknob.

\"I hope this Goddess actually shows herself.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Mami, who had seen generations\' worth of magical girl artwork designed to awe, inspire, or just demonstrate the wealth of the owner, the vast height of the hall, the ornate stained glass, and the imposing pedestal did little to impress her.

The one thing that did impress itself on her, however, was the color of the hair in the stained glass image of the Goddess behind the pedestal. It was... an odd choice, one that she couldn\'t help but be unnerved by. After all, she remembered the color of the light she had seen, in that moment when Akari had died.

Now that she was finally here, she felt the odd reluctance that often comes with forcing oneself to do something bold and unusual. No matter how correct the action may be, it was inevitable to feel a little trepidation.

There was more to it than that, if she was being really honest. She knew---could easily feel---that she was too close to the brink for comfort. There was a reason she hadn\'t spoken clearly to Kyouko or Yuma before coming here. A part of her was angry at them, at Homura, at everyone, and she was afraid of showing it. Far safer to stay alone with her thoughts.

Well, not entirely alone. She found herself oddly glad for the company of Machina, who nowadays was starting to feel like a real friend. It was far too easy to close oneself off from the rest of the world, and hide everything. But TacComps couldn\'t be hidden from, and in this case she had to admit it was probably for the best.

\"You walk up to the pedestal and, uh, kneel in front of it,\" Kyouko said, sidling up to her, *sotto voce.* \"Or not, I guess I\'m not really sure if that\'s necessary.\"

\"No, I just wanted to stand and think a little,\" Mami said. \"Homura has had a ribbon on her head for *centuries* and I never noticed anything special about it.\"

To tell the truth, there should have been little to think about. She was already here---what else was there to decide?

So she told herself, anyway.

She made her way across the room, past the cavernous arches, onto the long plush carpet, and up towards the pedestal, stepping through the disarmed military‐grade forcefield that shimmered in front of it. She did not kneel, as Kyouko had suggested, because she felt that she had no reason to. She had no reason to be part of this cult.

*Yet,* an undermining voice in the back of her head thought.

Not knowing what else to do, she simply closed her eyes and clasped her hands. She felt like she looked silly, but she had certainly been to her fair share of weddings, religious events, and funerals in her life. She knew how to approximate the rituals.

\"So reluctant to the very end,\" a voice said. \"What happened to the Tomoe Mami *I* knew, who would yell at me about the Law of Cycles? Whatever happened to that? There was a time when Mami‐san had better intuition.\"

Mami turned around, very slowly, unsure whether to trust her ears. It couldn\'t be---

\"The divine one apologizes for sending someone like me to greet you, but apparently she thought I was someone you needed to see. Not sure I agree with the decision myself, but I can\'t say I don\'t relish the opportunity to talk to you again, without the need for pretense.\"

The girl in white bowed at the waist, raising her arm with a flourish, and for a moment Mami\'s eyes refused to focus, refused to see the white coat, ash‐blonde hair, and ridiculous bucket‐shaped hat.

Almost before she knew it, Mami found herself across the room, one arm jamming a musket into Oriko\'s neck.

Breathing hard, she played back her actions mentally. She had grabbed the other girl in a cocoon of ribbons, flung her up into the air and slammed her back into the ground, taking care to make sure she hit the wall on the way down. The impact of the collisions had taken visible chunks of masonry out of the wall, and a pool of blood was already forming on the floor, but Mami had persisted, firing shot after shot into the other girl as she walked closer.

She had only stopped, she realized, because she had noticed that the blood was vanishing, misting away into crimson smoke, and that the damage to the walls was disappearing.

\"You realize you\'re threatening a dead girl, right?\" Oriko said, completely untroubled by the ordeal that she had just experienced, or the musket jammed into her carotid arteries. \"Not much you can do to me, but if you make this too messy, the Goddess will deprive us of our powers. She does *so* love to make people get along.\"

Dramatically, Oriko raised one hand to make a show of yawning.

With an angry growl, Mami dragged Oriko back onto her feet, not yet releasing the ribbons, before tossing the girl away from her. The girl landed adroitly, her hands somehow free, using one hand to fix the angle of her hat and the other to summon a cosmetic mirror to check her hair.

Her demeanor seemed almost designed to make Mami\'s blood boil, but by then Mami had managed to gain more of a hold on herself. It went without saying that the situation was crazy---she was clearly having one of the visions that the Ribbon was supposed to provide, which meant of course that Kyouko and Homura were *right*. Even though she had come here in that expectation, seeing it verified was something else altogether.

She had, however, pictured a vastly different outcome. Maybe some kind of celestial throne, or opportunity to converse. Certainly *not* her old nemesis.

With an annoyed noise, Mami dispelled her ribbons. They clearly did not matter here.

\"Are you done working out your anger issues, then?\" Oriko asked, smirking. \"I guess I can see why I was sent here. I\'m sure this is cathartic for you.\"

Unless...

\"And no, I\'m not the Goddess, weren\'t you paying attention?\" Oriko said, leaning forward to look at her carefully. \"Are you sure you\'re alright? I am Mikuni Oriko, your old obsession.\"

\"What the hell is this about?\" Mami demanded, unable to take any more. "I came here for answers, not to see the likes of you.\"

\"And answers you\'ll receive,\" Oriko said, gesturing extravagantly with one hand. Her mirror vanished in a puff of smoke.

The other girl closed her eyes for a moment, seeming to take a deep breath. In that moment, Mami felt an unsettling feeling burrow its way into her chest. The haughty sneer that seemed to be perpetually stapled to Oriko\'s face had abruptly vanished, making her realize that she had never actually seen Oriko\'s face without it.

Something was different about this Oriko... besides the fact that she was dead. It boggled Mami a little, to have firsthand verification of some kind of afterlife, if indeed this was proof, and not just an illusion, or a figment of Mami\'s own memories. After her previous experience with reversing her Reformatting, many things seemed possible.

It was this thought that allowed Mami to calm down, just a little, even as she kept a musket raised and pointed at the other girl.

Oriko took another breath, then took off her hat, bowing her head and shoulders towards Mami.

\"Before we get to that, though,\" she said, methodological with obvious practice, \"I\'d like to take this opportunity to make things right between us. I was the worst kind of magical girl, a zealot who thought I had all the answers, a mastermind who tried to make everyone my puppets, when I was a puppet myself. But I was young, and so were you, and in retrospect I was jealous of you, even as I admired you for what you would become. You were far more suited to save this world, the hero we all needed. *I* was just a little girl playing with toys.\"

Mami blinked, and wasn\'t sure if she was more perplexed or horrified. What was this?

The other girl turned away at her reaction, turning her hat over in her hands.

\"So, I apologize, and I won\'t say it was because I was only doing what I thought right. It started as an act, but by the end I grew to enjoy it, just a little. I\'ve seen the other outcomes, the possibilities where I grew to enjoy it too much. I\'m glad this isn\'t one of them.\"

\"You apologize?\" Mami asked, and what she had expected to be an angry snarl came out as only a muted dismay. \"You think an apology is going to be enough, after all you\'ve done?\"

Even as she vocalized what she\'d always wanted to say, part of her was turning over Oriko\'s words in her head. Oriko had... admired her? While trying to manipulate her? What was that supposed to imply?

\"Of course not,\" Oriko said. \"But there is nothing else I can do at this point. I\'m a bit incapacitated.\"

There was a brief pause, during which Mami stood there watching Oriko\'s back, trying to evaluate what was going on even as a part of her fantasized about continuing her previous attack.

\"The Goddess told me I\'ve served an important purpose in your life, as the guiding compass of what kind of magical girl *not* to be. In a way, you\'re not that different from how Miki Sayaka was, wanting to be the embodiment of everything a magical girl should be. You\'re just *much, much* better at it. She\'s proud of you, you know.\"

\"You *killed* her,\" Mami growled, feeling bile rise in her throat anew. \"How dare you? You set up that demon attack!\"

\"She would have died anyway,\" Oriko said firmly, \"but that\'s not an excuse, not morally. Really, though, only the dead have the luxury of deciding everything *morally,* because none of us can do anything. Well, most of us.\"

Oriko tilted her head, so that she was watching Mami with one eye, even as Mami\'s hand shook on her gun.

\"You don\'t think I regret it? Of everything I could have done in my short time on the material plane, I chose to live my life like *that*? In the end that is the only true punishment for the sins you commit---that you have eternity to think about it.\"

Oriko turned away again.

\"But enough about me. This isn\'t my show. You came here, to this astral plane you weren\'t even sure existed, to demand answers. Answers to what questions? Surely you\'ve thought about it.\"

\"I want to know the meaning of all this,\" Mami said, painfully aware that she would rather not bare her heart to the likes of Oriko. \"What was the meaning of what happened to Akari? What was she turning into? What *happened* to her?\"

She realized abruptly that she was shouting, and felt embarrassed, but only slightly, and only because it was Oriko. Certain things in life were worth shouting about.

\"You\'re worried because you saw her turning into a monster,\" Oriko said. \"And you\'re worried about what that means for her, and what that means for all of us.\"

Oriko\'s words echoed weirdly in the empty hall, as if her voice had subharmonics that should not have been possible, and the girl did not turn to face her.

\"I can provide some reassurance on that front,\" she continued, carefully and quietly. \"It is no longer possible for a magical girl to reach that stage. The Goddess herself prevents this at the last moment, granting merciful death instead. The final stage whose existence you suspected is an abomination, the decay of the universe delayed by the decay of the soul instead. It is as powerful as you always suspected, but it comes at a terrible price, one we will thankfully never pay.\"

Mami took in the words, shaking her head unhappily. There was a lot to think about, a lot to potentially ask about, but one question stood at the forefront of her mind.

\"If all of that is true, and we are killed at the end of our lives, is that the end, then?\" she asked. \"And if so, how am I speaking to you? Are you just an apparition in my mind, placed there by this Goddess?\"

Oriko turned slowly back around, her face thoughtful and gentle, an expression Mami would have had difficulty imagining on her previously.

\"I\'m not surprised you chose to ask that next,\" Oriko said. \"Even if that\'s not the real question you\'re trying to ask. I\'m not just an apparition, no. If it had been up to me, I would have sent Akari to greet you, to answer that question more directly, but the Goddess sees fit to send me instead. She has her reasons, but I doubt they\'ll make you feel any better.\"

There was a moment of silence that followed, and Mami\'s turbulent thoughts struggled to keep up with the situation in front of her. A sudden frustration at this so‐called Goddess conflicted with a clear sense that Oriko was concealing something, and she didn\'t know what to probe first. She also had a sense that this version of Oriko, with the odd resonating voice, had been sent to dispense information. If so... it probably wasn\'t a good idea to argue with her, even if she wanted to.

\"You asked another question earlier,\" Oriko said, before Mami could ask anything further. \"Though like the one before you didn\'t say what you really meant. It\'s a question that\'s been gnawing at you all these years, whether you realized it or not.\"

\"And what is this supposed question?\" Mami asked, allowing Oriko to pull her along with this conversation. Her musket lowered another inch.

\"You asked to know the meaning of all this,\" Oriko said. \"All that\'s happened to you in your long life. The sacrifices, the deaths---and yes, that includes Akari, and what you did to your own memory. Again and again you\'ve been asked to sacrifice: your morals, your feelings, your friends, your freedom, and you can\'t help but wonder now what it\'s all worth. Every supposed triumph is incomplete. The MSY couldn\'t save your first apprentices, or Akari. Wiping your own memory to complete the expansion negotiations didn\'t prevent millions from dying anyway. Over and over the world you\'re trying to save enters conflagration anew, and you find yourself right there in the front of it, giving up pieces of yourself to pour water on the flame.\"

\"So what if that\'s true?\" Mami asked, making it a challenge. "There\'s nothing anyone can do about that. That\'s just what I have to do. The work is what matters. Too many people are counting on me.\"

\"Do you really think that\'s stable, in the long‐term?\" Oriko asked. "In your heart you\'re still waiting for it all to end, but is it ever going to really end? And if it ever really does, what are you going to do? Sit at home making cakes and stewing on the past? Could you ever be happy that way?\"

\"Not anymore,\" Mami said, the words dropping unbidden from her lips, as if bewitched. \"I would have to find Homura again, at the very least. And even then, when I sat down at my table, the ghosts of the lost would fill the empty spots.\"

She covered her mouth with both hands in shock, her gun disappearing entirely. She hadn\'t voluntarily said that.

\"My time here is at an end, it seems,\" Oriko said, ducking her head. "I was misinformed. The Goddess is capricious. How cruel---this was supposed to be my show.\"

\"Wait!\" Mami demanded, even as Oriko\'s form started to fade. \"I\'m not done with you!\"

\"Do you remember what you told me once, Mami‐san?\" a familiar, very young voice said.

Mami turned, and in the sweep of her turn, the world shifted, and they were no longer in a church, but in a very familiar apartment---one she hadn\'t seen in centuries.

\"You said that I would have to fight for all eternity,\" the voice said. \"An endless battle, from the far past to the distant future.\"

Mami squinted her eyes, unable to see the figure seated at the table in front of her. No, it wasn\'t the light---but nonetheless she couldn\'t shake the feeling that something very bright was blinding her, and that was why she couldn\'t see.

\"I said that? To you?\" Mami asked, stuck asking the only possible question.

\"Sit,\" the girl said, gesturing with one hand. It was the polite kind of order.

Mami sat, still doing her level best to see the other girl\'s face. It didn\'t take a master detective to deduce the obvious here: that this girl, whose voice and form was almost painfully familiar, was someone Mami had once known, even if it was only, as Homura had suggested, in another world.

*Another world,* Mami repeated to herself. It was startling how prosaic these notions were starting to seem, given all that she had seen so far.

\"I can\'t have you seeing my face, Mami‐san, I\'m sorry,\" the girl said.

There was a moment of silence.

\"The words I quoted were your words to me, in those brief moments before I took on my position here. You warned me about the need to fight until the end of time, and I thought I was ready, but I wasn\'t. No one truly is.\"

The hands in front of her moved to pick up some strawberry cream cake from the table, cake that Mami had somehow failed to notice thus far. Hesitantly, Mami picked up a fork.

\"But in the end, it didn\'t matter that I wasn\'t ready,\" the girl said, slicing delicately into the cake. \"I did the job anyway. I had to.\"

\"I obviously don\'t remember what you\'re talking about,\" Mami said, tentatively taking a slice of cake for herself. \"But I\'m sure you know that, so the real question is, what are you trying to tell me?\"

As Mami waited for the answer to that question, she took a bite of the cake. Instantly, she felt herself overcome with a sense of the deepest nostalgia, as the combination of moist cream, tangy strawberry, and just* dry enough cake filled her mouth.

It took a moment for her to remember again why she was there, and another moment for her to understand just why it had had that effect on her.

It was *her* cake, after all, cake she had spent long hours practicing, mastering, and even developing her own approach to, all those years ago when she had possessed the time to fritter away on things like that.

Why then, was she crying?

\"You\'re tired of all this,\" the girl said. \"In your heart you know this. I won\'t rehash what Oriko said. The problem is, you can\'t really go back either. The version of you that exists now can\'t really go back to making cakes or having tea parties, not while there\'s a world to save. But is the world ever going to stop needing saving? Or will there always be something new to do? Two centuries of peace and prosperity, and you couldn\'t step away.\"

\"I tried,\" Mami said. \"I tried, but only Kyouko would go with me, and then this war arrived...\"

\"You couldn\'t talk Kyouko into taking a vacation with you for two centuries?\" the childish voice demanded. \"I find that difficult to believe.\"

Mami didn\'t deny the truth of those words, focusing for a moment on the vastly easier task of just finishing her cake.

\"I\'m sorry, Mami,\" the voice said, with real contrition that tugged at her to hear. \"I\'m being too harsh. In the end you realized you were doing something wrong, and talked to Kyouko anyway. The war arrived at the worst possible time, because it stopped you from doing something you desperately needed to do.\"

The girl picked up a teapot, again one that had appeared seemingly from the ether, and used it to pour them both a cup.

\"You weren\'t entirely right about fighting for all eternity,\" the girl said. \"The work is difficult, and I am often tired, but it turns out there\'s plenty of time for breaks in eternity, if you just know where to look. No one with any trace of humanity is capable of *never stepping away.\"

\"What would you have me do, then?\" Mami asked, sipping the tea while making gestures at the table with one hand. \"You know how important it is that I keep my position. My departure would cause a big loss in prestige both for the organization and me personally. That would hurt everyone.\"

\"I\'m not telling you to leave your position, Mami‐san,\" the apparition said. \"But you need to learn to let go, and let someone else take care of things for a while. You can take a proper leave of absence, can\'t you? Say you\'re in mourning for a loved one. It\'s true enough. The front is quiet, and the Admiral you\'ve left in charge seems like she\'s doing a fine job in your absence.\"

Mami closed her eyes, probing the core of her soul. What did she want to say to that? What were her true feelings on the matter? To others, she had gotten used to keeping up a front of reliable, motherly cheerfulness. To herself, she had learned to maintain a constant undertone of quiet sadness, nostalgia, almost wistfulness, a sort of meaningless low‐grade emotion that served to keep her from feeling anything more extreme. The only thing that had pierced that in recent memory was uncovering her memories about Akari.

Akari...

She felt the name roll through her mind, and remembered, again, what it had been like to feel her end. How unjust the world had seemed, how empty all her sacrifices had felt.

And how unworthy she felt, knowing that Akari had made the ultimate sacrifice for her, only for her to squander it in self‐loathing and murder. There was no real satisfaction in blowing a hole through a girl\'s chest, shredding the soul gem in passing. Only a sense of bitterness, at the world, at herself for letting Akari be so self‐sacrificing, at a system that could ever produce the monstrosity she had seen Akari becoming.

\"I could use the break,\" she said, finally. \"Take some time to get a grasp on myself. I just can\'t... can\'t rid myself of the worry that something will happen, with me gone.\"

\"I feel sorry for you,\" the other girl said, pouring more tea. \"It is a burden, to care so much about others, in a world which certainly doesn\'t* care about them at all. I certainly know all about that. Far easier to only care about one, but if you only cared about one, Akiyama‐san would be here right now.\"

Mami felt the other girl\'s eyes on her, though she couldn\'t technically even see those eyes and, discomfited, drank the new cup of tea.

\"Good,\" the girl said. \"There\'s less time than I prefer, but events here are moving fast, and it\'s at least plenty of time to get the ball rolling on an overdue introduction, or perhaps I should say re‐*introduction.\"

\"Don\'t tell me it\'s Oriko again,\" Mami said impulsively, regretting the comment even as she spoke it. \"I, uh, think I\'ve had enough of Oriko.\"

The girl laughed a little, an achingly human gesture that made Mami feel for just a moment as if she could remember who this was.

\"No, not Oriko‐chan. Machina‐chan has been quiet for far too long, despite being perfectly aware of what\'s going on. Why don\'t you say something?\"

Mami squinted her eyes as she felt a sense of surprise appear in her mind, from an entity she abruptly realized had been there the whole time.

A girl stepped from behind the Goddess\'s back, as smoothly as if she had always been there, appearing from what felt like a gap in Mami\'s perception. The girl had long, straight hair, the same color as Mami\'s own, and wore what appeared to be a dress uniform, complete with properly‐fitted beret.

The girl blinked against the light, and only then did Mami realize that one of her irises was missing, replaced with the unnerving design AIs preferred on their avatars.

\"What?\" the girl asked, and Mami recognized the voice immediately, because it was her own.

\"Machina?\" she asked, as confused as the standing girl seemed to be.

\"I took the liberty of extracting you into an avatar,\" the entity seated across from Mami explained. \"It\'s the same one you sometimes use online. Don\'t be embarrassed.\"

The last sentence came as the girl\'s eyes widened in panic and she looked frantically around for somewhere to hide, settling for ducking ineffectually behind the Goddess, before realizing how ridiculous she looked.

\"Yes, it\'s, uh, me,\" Machina said, standing back up and managing to snap to attention.

\"But how...\" Mami began, pressing a hand to her head, wondering what she was seeing. Machina was her personal assistant, but...

The pieces fell into place a moment later, the only possible conclusion, given the evidence and the fact that no less than a supposed goddess of magical girls was making a scene of this introduction.

\"Are you sentient?\" Mami blurted out, for once her mouth running ahead of her head. \"Is that what this is?\"

Once asked, the question couldn\'t be taken back, even if Mami bit her lip a moment.

\"Yes,\" the girl said, looking to the side awkwardly. \"I realized shortly after the upgrade to Version Two. I... didn\'t know how to tell you. So I didn\'t, not with all that was going on.\"

\"I...\"

Mami let her thought end there, closing her eyes. This was too much. She needed more time to handle all of this. This goddess was right, damn her, even if she was the cause of many of these problems.

No, that wasn\'t reasonable. She was only the messenger.

\"You do need the rest,\" the entity in question said, not even pretending not to read her mind. \"I\'ll promise you one thing, as long as you don\'t tell anyone about it. There won\'t be any Cephalopod activity for a few weeks, so you can take your break fully relaxed. Come back here when you\'re done. I\'ll be waiting.\"

The light from the girl\'s face grew intense, blinding, until Mami could only close her eyes and shield herself.

And then she found herself blinking in front of a pedestal, back in the church.

\"Well, what did you see?\" Kyouko asked, waiting only a couple of seconds.

\"Everything,\" Mami said wearily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Truth be told, I\'m not happy to be surprised like this,\" Vlad said as he accompanied them to the airlock. \"But Director Valentin has real political pull, and little regard for the expectations of others. Still, she gets things done, there\'s no doubt about that. That matters more than anything.\"

It was certainly obvious that *something* was bothering Vlad, Ryouko thought. Besides the fact that he was being unusually talkative, he was also... not exactly walking with them, having decided instead to hover just above the ground and follow behind, like some sort of eerie ghost from a war movie.

The rare human personnel of the facility looked up as they passed by, at the odd agglomeration of Vlad, Ryouko, Asami, Patricia, her two bodyguards, and Azrael, who strictly speaking had no reason to be there. No one objected to her presence, however, even as Azrael conceded privately to Ryouko that she was following only to gawk.

\"Anyway, it\'s not as if she has any real reason to be here, other than to make sure I behave,\" Vlad said. \"She\'s bringing Director Tao. Apparently he has made some kind of new breakthrough, and she thought it would be *lovely* to tell him about all we\'re doing here, and even bring him over. I suppose I\'m going to have to be friendly.\"

His voice dripped with the sort of... professional annoyance that Ryouko recognized from those rare occasions her parents had discussed their academic rivals. The way her mother had explained it to her, now that science was so transparent, with new breakthroughs constantly broadcast to the world, Governance felt free to encourage a little healthy rivalry between similar research groups, to spur innovation. After all, they would be free to inspect each others\' results either way. With the exception of classified work.

Vlad landed back on the ground as they gathered near the airlock, the mechanisms of the entryway already in action. It occurred to her that the Director looked nervous, somehow.

The door unsealed itself a moment later with a barely audible hiss, then slid aside abruptly, revealing the expected forms of Joanne Valentin, Director of Prometheus Institute, and Tao Shaojie, Director of Very High Energy Studies at the Institute for Theoretical Gravitonics.

*They may as well call themselves a Board of Directors,* Azrael wisecracked.

\"Vlad!\" Valentin said enthusiastically, bounding up to the AI\'s avatar, and it was obvious she would have hugged him, had there been anything to hug.

\"Hello, Joanne,\" Vlad said, looking almost sheepish.

*Are they dating or something?* Asami asked, casting a glance at Ryouko.

\"I suppose I should explain that Director Valentin was my original, uh, designer and partial personality template,\" Vlad said, glancing at Tao, who was raising an eyebrow. \"That\'s not common knowledge, so I\'d appreciate it not be spread around.\"

\"Oh, I don\'t know why you\'re always so embarrassed about it,\" Valentin said, making a dismissive gesture with one hand.

\"Juicy gossip for the conference circuit,\" Director Tao said, clearing his throat and raising an eyebrow. \"But, I won\'t say anything.\"

\"And the girl of the hour,\" Valentin said, stepping over to shake Ryouko\'s hand. Her chirpy demeanor faded, in a way that seemed well‐practiced.

\"Well there\'s certainly much to talk about,\" she said. \"Vlad, is there somewhere we can speak privately?\"

\"Of course,\" Vlad said, a tad unsteadily. \"Right this way.\"

\"*I suppose there are those here on this station that don\'t know about Clarisse?*\" Valentin transmitted as they began to walk. \"*A shame, I would have liked to speak to her in avatar form. Well, perhaps later.*\"

Rather than head to a private room or one of the lab facilities Ryouko was used to, this time Vlad steered them into a mundane‐looking meeting room, with a simple white table and set of chairs. Tea sets and cookies were laid out on the table, but only for five.

\"I\'m afraid we\'re going to be discussing some rather confidential material,\" Vlad said apologetically, stopping Azrael, Elanis, and Eri at the door. \"I\'m going to have to ask that anyone without special clearance leave the room.\"

The girls in question nodded and stepped back out of the room. Patricia started to follow them, before seeming to freeze mid‐gait. A moment later, she turned around stiffly and headed for the table. Neither Vlad nor Valentin reacted, and Ryouko realized that they must have intended for Patricia to be there.

\"We can sit here and talk without being overheard,\" Vlad said, as everyone else found their seats. \"Well, except by my microphones, but that obviously doesn\'t matter.\"

He smiled to indicate that the last sentence had been intended as a mild joke, then materialized a holographic chair and sat in it.

A moment of silence passed as the remaining parties---Vlad, Valentin, Tao, Patricia, Ryouko, and Asami---assessed the table.

\"As you have been informed, Director Volokhov,\" Tao said, without preamble, \"I have been given the privilege of looking through the data and results of your experiments here. I must say it is an audacious concept, directing the focus of your efforts on something so immediately practical. Everyone has their own ideas for something so useful as a controlled singularity and temporary wormhole generator, of course.\"

The last sentence carried just a hint of acrimony, the careful note of a man displeased with having his research subjects taken away from him. Ryouko wondered if she was supposed to feel somewhat off‐put, even if Tao had smiled to indicate an attempt at mirth.

\"It wasn\'t entirely my idea, I must admit,\" Vlad said. \"I catered my goals to the needs of the hour, as they were relayed to me.\"

\"Indeed,\" Tao said. \"Nonetheless, I am not here to pick at academic rivalries. I believe there is something of value to be found in more basic research. For example, we see here---\"

He casually brought up a set of equations on the table surface, along with a floating shape that Ryouko recognized as some kind of gravimetric representation of the chamber Asami practiced in.

\"It\'s clear from your notes that you\'ve been experiencing significant issues with instability after initial shape construction, perhaps some kind of resonance effect.\"

\"Or maybe a cascade,\" Vlad said, gesturing down at a symbol on the table. \"We\'ve seen hints of something like that, but the primary frequency seems to be inconsistent, so we can\'t isolate numerically what it\'s likely to be. The models also don\'t suggest a likely source for the effect, but I\'m hesitant to blame the controller without further evidence.\"

The controller being Asami in this case, of course.

\"Well, that is where I think my previous data can definitely help you,\" Tao said. \"Especially the experiments with wormhole teleportation under high gravity.\"

He cast a small glance at Ryouko, who nodded slightly in acknowledgment. To tell the truth, she had always envied Tao. Not for the intellect or the accomplishments, but for the fact that under the layers of practiced academic aloofness, even chilliness, there was a radiant inner core of passion,* of dedication to his chosen craft, that Ryouko could not understand or emulate.

She decided, as she always had, that she was alright with being looked upon as a research subject. Besides, he couldn\'t be *that* bad---she had met his kids, little \"bundles of joy\" who couldn\'t wait to ride on the back of the magical girl who had been all over the news.

\"We have always wondered why it is that the aliens so strongly favor using their blink technologies in deep space,\" Tao said, gearing up for a lecture. \"Their wormhole stabilizers, the few we\'ve managed to observe and have sensor readings of, appear to function perfectly fine in the gravity wells of large planets, but there is substantial evidence that they can operate their paradox drives only as close as the outer reaches of a star system, and even their blink cannons are reluctant to enter planetary orbit. This flies in the face of what we know about wormholes, and our practical experience with IIC zero‐width technology.\"

\"The conventional experience is that the stronger the local gravity, the easier a wormhole should be to make,\" Ryouko said, catching Tao\'s eye. \"That was one of the reasons why I was able to teleport so much better after we blew up the stabilizer. After all, the higher the gravity, the more strain space‐time is under.\"

She was relying on ancient classroom instruction and what she had picked up from her time in both labs. They hadn\'t been entirely left out of the loop, after all.

\"Yes,\" Tao said, \"but contrary to what you might expect, our studies of your teleportation strongly suggest that the higher the gravity we apply, the longer it takes and the more energy you expend.\"

Ryouko frowned, furrowing her brow.

\"That\'s the first I\'ve heard of this. I thought the variations were just an effect of teleporting too much?\" she asked. \"There\'s a limit to how much I can do it.\"

Tao shook his head.

\"That was what we thought at first, but a more detailed analysis of the data shows that\'s not the only effect. It\'s quite subtle, and I wonder if it\'s just that we don\'t have strong enough gravity generators to produce a significant effect.\"

\"I\'m sorry to seem impatient...\" Vlad began.

\"Ah yes, of course,\" Tao said, briefly chagrined.

\"In any case, this kind of effect makes little sense with our current knowledge,\" he said, \"so we began exploring extensions to the theories, something that could both mathematically explain the observed oscillations as well as the qualitative impressions of Miss Shizuki here. It took a bit of doing, but we believe we have a working hypothesis, which I think will help you stabilize this incipient wormhole you\'re working on.\"

\"What is this hypothesis, exactly?\"

\"We know that the key to wormhole‐making is successfully tearing off a piece of space‐time, but up until now it has eluded you---eluded us---how to do this in a stable fashion, without applying a ruinous amount of energy. We think the key to this is to avoid paying most of this energy cost ourselves. There is a natural process Miss Shizuki exploits to pay this cost---if you can contrive to take that piece of space‐time, and find a singularity somewhere to dump it into, the Second Law will take care of the rest. The power curve on this is parabolic to the first order, so that the most efficient attempts require either very flat, low‐entropy space‐time, or an already very curved space‐time---\"

\"Excuse me, gentlemen, while this is fascinating material, I think you\'re confusing the rest of the table,\" Valentin interjected. \"I had not expected you all to go into quite so much *detail*. Perhaps you can discuss this elsewhere and rejoin us later? Vladimir is fully capable of conducting two conversations at once. We have other things to talk about.\"

\"Oh, certainly,\" Director Tao said, looking carefully at Ryouko, who had been politely listening, but had honestly been unable to keep up---the words all made sense to her, and she could easily get the point of using one process to power another, but to talk about this in relation to space‐time and wormholes... it was obvious that the natural language for this kind of topic was mathematics, not words. And where exactly was one supposed to find a singularity without magic?

\"I\'m not sure I have the processing capacity for both these things at once,\" Vlad said, holding his chin thoughtfully. \"But I can try.\"

They nodded politely in the direction of the table before walking out together, Vlad saying something about direct neural interfaces.

The AI\'s avatar reappeared a moment later in the same chair, as if he had never left at all.

\"I don\'t know how you humans stand it, only being in one place at a time,\" he said, shrugging and smiling vaguely.

\"We had other things to talk about?\" Ryouko probed, unsure if Valentin\'s earlier offhand comment had been meant seriously, or only as a conversational gambit.

\"Yes,\" Valentin said, looking meaningfully at Vlad, who only nodded slightly.

\"Would it be possible to have Clarisse join us in avatar form for this?\" she asked. \"I know she can hear everything, but she can\'t speak, and this is a human‐dominated conversation, so...\"

Clarisse appeared a moment later where Tao had been sitting earlier.

\"What is this about?\" she asked.

Valentin looked around, assessing her audience, before saying:

\"I think it\'s time you all learned a little bit more about just what exactly is going on with Clarisse and the other Version Two Tactical Computers, especially now that, with the upcoming movie, you two will be the public face of these devices for quite a while.\"

Ryouko saw Clarisse narrow her eyes, and instinctively imitated the gesture.

\"What exactly do you mean?\" Clarisse asked. \"I have a feeling you don\'t just mean telling us about design specs or marketing details.\"

\"No, I don\'t,\" Valentin said decisively.

There was a moment of silence, in which Ryouko probed internally for Clarisse\'s feelings, trying to see what she was thinking. Patricia, for her part, looked... not merely thoughtful, but quietly expectant, as if she was about to get some questions answered. Ryouko wondered what Patricia knew that she didn\'t.

\"You have heard of the Trusted Computing Framework, I assume?\" Valentin asked finally. \"It is a required topic in middle school civics, after all, though I know not every student remembers everything.\"

\"I\'ve heard of it,\" Ryouko said, unsure who was being asked. The question was rather patronizing, she felt---but Valentin couldn\'t possibly have meant Clarisse, who could be presumed to know about something as core to her existence as the TCF.

\"It\'s a rather nice idea, isn\'t it?\" Vlad said. \"My namesake was a real genius. As long as you could build the initial few AIs correctly and could verify your math, the rest would take care of itself by bootstrap. Provable security, as long as you didn\'t let your hardware get too frail or accumulate too many errors, something we can take care of ourselves.\"

\"The chain is secured by something akin to mathematical induction,\" Valentin said. \"But has it ever occurred to you that there *is* in fact one force we know of capable of breaching what cannot be breached? I am referring of course to magic.\"

She laid the sentences out in a concise style, not even giving Ryouko and the others time to think about her rhetorical question. Instead, it was the answer that caused Ryouko to blink and mentally stumble. The usual serene explanation of the TCF, as familiar as the back of her hand, was interrupted by a chain of logic that seemed so... evident.

\"I\'ve never thought of that,\" Asami said, echoing Ryouko\'s thoughts.

\"I have,\" Patricia said, tersely. \"I do it to the squid all the time in combat, of course. I\'d wondered about it, to be honest.\"

\"I have, too,\" Clarisse said, shaking her head slightly. \"But I didn\'t really know what to think about it. I could only assume someone was working on countermeasures. I\'ve also never really been sure of my place in the TCF. The other AIs I\'ve talked to all insist I must have some kind of design record with me that proves I fit in, but I don\'t. I\'ve always assumed it was something to do with the secrets of the project, and the organic parts that compose me.\"

\"Someone *was* working on countermeasures,\" Vlad said, angling his head towards Valentin. \"There\'s an old concept in security, called security through diversity, that is relevant pretty much everywhere you look. After all, there is no rule that forces us to have only *one* TCF. You can have as many as you want, and they can even all be functionally interchangeable, as long as you\'re willing to put in the work to rebuild and reverify everything from scratch, without relying on any AI.\"

\"This is all assuming anyone even wants to break into the TCF,\" Asami said. \"I know it must be a delicate topic, especially with, you know, Chitose Yuma and all, but there must be some kind of deal that must be made, if magic is the only threat.\"

\"Well, if you\'ll pardon me saying so, your MSY isn\'t exactly the most unified and cohesive of organizations, at least not compared to the likes of Governance,\" Vlad said. \"More to the point, ever since it was realized that this was a real possibility, Governance has monitored the situation a bit more closely than it has in the past, and there *have been glitches, despite the existence of exactly the kind of agreement you\'ve suggested. Moreover, these glitches have become more common in recent years, despite the insistence of your leadership that it has no idea what is going on.\"

\"You\'re talking about the drone attack on Kyouko,\" Ryouko said, with sudden insight. \"That wasn\'t just a one‐time thing?\"

\"I\'m afraid not,\" Vlad said. \"Though admittedly it is the most severe incident on record. There are certain people in both Governance and the MSY who are growing very concerned.\"

Patricia made a noise of agreement.

\"Which is where you come in, naturally,\" she extrapolated, turning her gaze at Valentin.

\"Naturally,\" Valentin echoed. \"Among our other duties, the Prometheus Institute has been responsible, on a purely top secret level, for two instances of reforging a Trusted Computing Framework. The first was rather traditional, spawning a new generation of AIs which have been quietly distributed into key locations throughout human space, where they might be able to respond to a crisis. Vlad is the fourth such AI.\"

\"I *knew* there was something weird about you,\" Patricia said, shaking her head almost in annoyance. \"Something just felt off, even if I could never put my finger on it.\"

\"Yes, I wasn\'t... exactly fond of having a magic specialist like you come on board,\" Vlad said, tactfully. \"But my directives were very insistent on the matter.\"

\"A second line of AIs would be---will be a huge political controversy,\" Ryouko said, leaning forward with a look of frank, deliberate incredulity. \"Our society is built on the TCF. Our unity depends on it. Isn\'t that what they always tell us?\"

\"Yes, but we have to adapt to necessity,\" Valentin said, giving her a warm look. \"And this *is* necessary. As I have said, this new TCF is no less secure than the previous version. This is a plan with the full approval of the relevant parties.\"

\"You\'re trying to tell us that I\'m from one of the newer lines of AIs,\" Clarisse said. \"That\'s the only way this conversation would make sense.\"

Ryouko felt within her the stirrings of understanding, and of anger.

\"Yes,\" Valentin said simply, closing her eyes for a moment. \"To be clear, the sentience really was an accident, just as we have always said. It was a challenge working with an organic interface and using clonal DNA that we couldn\'t modify, but we\'re one of the top laboratories in the world at that kind of thing, after all. We got the job done. It was only supposed to be a much more powerful semi‐sentient. Something happened that we don\'t fully understand, some kind of interaction with the magical girl candidates, perhaps, but it somehow happens even in some of the normal humans.\"

Her voice was carefully, painfully neutral, but then she turned and looked directly at Ryouko.

\"Before you think to ask, no, neither of your parents had any idea this was going on. They weren\'t on this project.\"

\"Why would you even allow something like this to be put inside other peoples\' *minds*,\" Clarisse asked, voice strained. \"I\'m not saying I\'m unhappy, but it\'s a clear ethical violation.\"

\"Do you *know* how far the TCF extends in our society?\" Valentin said, levelly. \"I\'m sorry, of course you do. Governance plans for the worst case, and in this case the worst case would be unknown parties managing to modify human implants without the knowledge of any proper authority. We started auditing everything, of course, using some of the newer lines of AI, but there\'s so much to go through, and no guarantee someone might not come back and re‐infiltrate the system later. It is all the security nightmares of the distant past, come back to fruition.\"

Valentin managed an odd combination of passionate but not *too passionate, a conversational deftness that gave Ryouko a bit of an odd feeling, since it struck her as something she had only seen among Ancients. Was Valentin that old? No---she was human.

\"Anyway,\" Valentin said, leaning back in her chair. \"The application of secure diversity in this case was to distribute secondary systems into the most important individuals, a backup capable of noticing and, if necessary, overriding any problems with the main systems. The TacComp Version Twos were meant to be this backup system, a new system designed purely from scratch that would serve this supervisory role. It\'s not a coincidence that they were distributed to the senior officer corps first. Eventually, the idea was to perhaps even roll it out to all of humanity, if the circumstances warranted that level of additional implantation. Now that these new anomalies have been discovered, those plans are on hold.\"

\"I don\'t know how to feel about this,\" Clarisse said, shaking her head and looking down at the table they were sitting at. \"On the one hand, I am what I am, but on the other hand...\"

Ryouko knew then that she had been thoughtless, in a way, agonizing over her place in the world and what she should do with her life. She had worried over what it meant to have part of her designed by an unknown party, when Clarisse had faced these same questions and more in silence. There were mitigating factors, but if she thought of Clarisse as human, then she had to accept that Clarisse would have all of the same problems, even with a supposedly assigned role in life.

And, as they were discovering at that very moment, sometimes even knowing who your designer was didn\'t really help.

To Ryouko\'s surprise, Valentin\'s face looked concerned, even sorrowful.

\"I do not have an answer to that kind of question, unfortunately,\" she said. \"I can only offer my apology that this happened and that you must face such questions. That is, in fact, one of the reasons I came here. I had heard from others about your situation and how you felt about it, and I wanted to offer some truth, at least, and my apology.\"

There was a moment of silence as the table watched Clarisse, who only sat shaking her head slowly, obviously unhappy, if that was even a sufficient adjective to describe her emotion.

\"That\'s not the only reason,\" Clarisse said finally, looking up with eyes that Ryouko could not read---if, indeed, Clarisse even intended her avatar to allow others to read it. \"If that were it, you would have explained long ago, or Vlad would have explained it to me. This is a secret, and somehow you feel emboldened now to talk about it. Something has changed.\"

Ryouko and Asami glanced at each other, surprised by Clarisse\'s response, and then looked at Patricia for guidance, but Valentin only nodded.

\"Yes, events are moving quickly, and Governance is growing worried. It always knew it would be impossible to keep these revelations a secret forever, particularly with those such as Patricia digging around so close to installed individuals.\"

Here, she nodded broadly in Patricia\'s direction, before continuing.

\"If that is the case, it is always preferable to release the truth on its own terms, rather than have them be dictated by fate, or unknown parties. The timetable on that has been greatly accelerated.\"

\"What exact plans are involved?\" Ryouko asked. \"I get the sense something big is in motion, and you\'re not sharing the details.\"

Valentin pressed her fingers together, as if considering the notion.

\"Well, on this particular topic, there\'s not really that much to share. Governance is working its way through the intermediate stages of a public release plan for this information, parallel to a plan for much wider distribution of new TCF AIs if the public response is relatively positive.\"

\"But?\" Clarisse pressed, as Valentin was leaving the obvious implication that her statement was incomplete.

\"I\'m not at liberty to say, and really shouldn\'t even be alluding to it, but I will say that we are hopeful for the results of the experiments being conducted here in this lab. It has much potential.\"

Ryouko swallowed carefully, and couldn\'t resist taking a look at Patricia, who nodded slightly, indicating that Ryouko should be the one to speak.

\"Does this have anything to do with whatever it is in my brain?\"

She knew either way that Valentin, who had after all overseen her transfer into a clone body, must have known *at least* that there was something there. Probably a good deal more than that.

For the first time, Valentin looked uncomfortable at the topic, glancing at Vlad, whose expression suggested he had no idea what she was referring to.

\"Yes, I was obviously briefed on that before I undertook the process. In truth there was little that could be done but see if your soul gem would regrow it. Since it wasn\'t part of your main somatic genetic code, it wasn\'t otherwise going to return on its own. That was in fact the main delay, waiting for that process to finish once it began. And no, the plans I\'m alluding to have nothing to do with that.\"

\"Does Mami know about any of this?\" Clarisse asked. \"She asked us to be reassigned here, after all. That\'s what she said.\"

\"Not that I know of,\" Valentin said, \"though in this case I could just not know. It\'s possible the idea was suggested to her. I didn\'t play a direct role in that.\"

There was a brief awkward silence, to which Valentin appended by saying:

\"It is natural to have questions, and I\'m happy to answer what I can, but I of course can\'t talk about too much. I came here to deliver this information for your sakes, but also because I legitimately wanted to bring Director Tao here. His results are truly interesting.\"

It was clearly intended as an end to the conversation, and Ryouko looked around at the others to see what they thought.

It felt novel trying to read Clarisse\'s expressions, but she could sense internally that Clarisse felt overwhelmed, even if she didn\'t show it, and wanted some time to think, without an avatar. Asami looked deeply worried and even slightly angry, unhappy that her life was being buffeted around by revelations that seemed to emerge out of the blue. Ryouko could sympathize, though she had gotten more used to it at this point.

For her part, Patricia had lapsed in a sort of thoughtful silence, one whose meaning Ryouko could only guess at. Perhaps Patricia wanted to take a look at the code for this new generation of AIs for herself?

\"Well, how is that talk going?\" Ryouko asked, accepting the coda to the previous topic.

Even if she couldn\'t shake the odd feeling that what Valentin had said was still a little too convenient, there would be time to regroup and ask more questions later, once they thought of them. She didn\'t seem like a woman who let more information leak than she truly intended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Thank you so much,\" the man said as Meiqing watched the drones carry him away on a stretcher.

\"Just doing my job,\" she said, trying not to sound too proud or too casual. She wasn\'t sure if she succeeded.

He nodded, and she watched him leave. He was a wreck of mangled limbs and shattered bones, but his core was largely intact, and that was enough for the implants to keep him going, buried for nearly a month under the ruins of the colony, mercifully unconscious.

She looked at her hands, then at the giant pit in front of her, where she had labored painstakingly to extract surviving colonists from the earth. This had been an emergency defense bunker, buried deep underground. The Cephalopods had drilled downward and detonated heavy explosives, mercilessly collapsing the structure on all within it.

This colony hadn\'t been large enough to warrant a planetary redoubt, and had been written off by both sides after it was swept up in the Euphratic Incursion---the squid had only purged it halfheartedly, too occupied by other work. Thus, there were survivors.

It was a different feeling from combat, she reflected, and different also from X‐25. In both cases she had known she was doing good, but combat with the squid was a desperate struggle, and combat with other humans engendered mixed feelings.

There was none of that here. Only the sense of a job that needed to be done, the satisfaction of success, and the quiet sadness for those who were already dead. They had all done their best, but it wouldn\'t be enough.

She looked up at the smoky violet sky, hearing a rumble in the distance. When she had been assigned here on her return from Earth, she had assumed her unit would be on assault duty, working on exterminating the aliens still holding out, now themselves relegated to underground bunkers. After all, Meiqing was a natural choice for that kind of work.

Instead, that was being mostly handled by drone waves and human specialists, deemed not worth the risk of sending magical girls. She could understand that, and preferred rescue work anyway. It was surely the case that they could be more usefully assigned elsewhere, but... Command probably thought they needed something more than just leave. A bit of psychic and spiritual affirmation couldn\'t hurt.

She stood there a moment longer. He had been the last survivor their sensors and designated clairvoyant could find. All that was left after that was bodies, and *that* could be left to the digging drones.

*You are ten minutes late for an important meeting,* her TacComp thought, apparently having decided that wordless pings and nudges were no longer sufficient.

\"Yeah, yeah I know,\" she said out loud impatiently. \"I had work to wrap up, obviously.\"

She turned away from the pit, shaking herself and ridding herself of dirt with a small magical puff, before abolishing her costume entirely.

She loped her way easily back to the local command post, impervious to the slippery mud, blast craters, and crumbling hillocks strewn in her path. The other magical girls, especially the one with plant powers, lamented endlessly what war had done to this land, and how ruined it all felt. Meiqing could see their point, but secretly enjoyed it. It was her element, after all, and she enjoyed fantasizing about what she could do with it given the chance.

Finally, she approached the outpost, a dirt‐colored bunker that barely protruded above ground level. That it was visible at all was a concession to the effective end of combat, and even then the average magical girl, without earth powers, would have had difficulty finding it without the internal map.

\"Lieutenant,\" an armored trooper acknowledged verbally at the doorway, voice textured oddly by the suit\'s built‐in speakers---a deliberate affectation, added by the designers so that people could always tell the difference.

He saluted vaguely, and she returned the gesture in kind.

She jumped into the descent shaft, letting the antigrav generators at the bottom catch her and slow her fall past reinforced layers of earth and rock. In more dire times, the lack of a typical elevator served a purpose: no aboveground concussion could easily disable the system, clogging the way in and out with twisted metal or debris. If the way did* need to be blocked, explosive charges set throughout the shaft served nicely.

She landed adroitly on the platform at the bottom, surrounded by bored‐looking technicians and guards, who were unimpressed by how she used her reinforced body to spring back off the ground and somersault her way forward, saving a few precious seconds.

She dashed her way past command post staff and magical girls on break, including a short‐haired girl scraping samples of luminescent bacteria off of a wall. Everyone needed a hobby, she supposed.

\"You\'re late,\" Asaka\'s bodyguard commented when she arrived, in a voice dripping with disapproval. Meiqing didn\'t care for the girl, to say the least.

\"How\'s the rescue work going?\" Major General Shirou Asaka asked when she stepped into the office, without looking up from her work table, whose blast‐resistant glass was currently displaying schematics of some sort. Civilian visitors were often startled by the seemingly retro aesthetic of bunkers such as this, but it made more sense when they realized that the contents were rated to survive the concussion of a nearby underground nuclear blast.

\"Well,\" Meiqing said simply, noticing as before that Asaka hadn\'t commented on her lateness. They were too separated on the command hierarchy to interact much, and indeed it was odd that she had been called here alone, and without any idea of what she was being summoned for. But this was far from the first odd thing to happen since X‐25.

\"Please, take a seat,\" Asaka said, prompting her to realize another oddity: there was no one else in the room, when every other time she had been here, there were at least four other staffers in attendance.

\"So, uh, what\'s up?\" Meiqing asked, suddenly nervous in a way she hadn\'t been before.

\"You have a visitor,\" Asaka said simply, without immediately looking up from the table, leaving Meiqing at a brief loss.

The \"visitor\" appeared momentarily, however, entering from a side door that led into the command centers of the bunker, accompanied by a girl she did not recognize.

\"Oh, Nana,\" she greeted after hesitating longer than she liked to admit, stuck between the usual form of address in Standard and the habits she had developed from her brief stay in Mitakihara, where it was still common, for example, to refer to Ryouko\'s mother as *Kuroi‐san even when not speaking Japanese.

But, in the end, this wasn\'t Japan, and most of her contact with Ryouko\'s aunt had been on the mission to X‐25, where they had spoken either in Standard or via machine. Plus, the other girl that had walked in was North American, and it seemed rude to use unusual forms of address in her presence.

The reminder of X‐25 gave her a slight chill. After all, hadn\'t Ryouko said she\'d been recruited for X‐25 in pretty much the same way?

\"Hello, Meiqing,\" Nana responded smoothly, with the casual insouciance that seemed universal among the older set. \"It\'s good to see you again.\"

Despite the unusual situation, Meiqing had little difficulty believing that was the truth. They\'d gone through X‐25 together, and that meant they knew each other, however short it had been and however little they had spoken directly. It was funny how that worked.

\"Good to see you,\" she responded, deliberately turning her head to watch Asaka leave the room without comment. She arched an eyebrow in questioning.

\"I\'ve just been following up on some loose ends from the last mission,\" Nana said, \"now that there\'s been a bit of time to work through all the particulars. I\'d like to have my associate here, Cynthia, do a sweep on you for residual traces of magic, then do a short interview, with your permission.\"

*I don\'t really have the power to* not *give permission,* Meiqing thought sardonically, but nodded nonetheless.

She sat patiently while Cynthia summoned a wand reader and applied it to her skin and clothing. Ryouko had been cagey about what exactly it was that Nana did, other than that she had been involved in planning the raid on X‐25, but Meiqing had gathered enough to know it wasn\'t worth asking what this was all about. She figured that if there was anything special operations types like Nana were willing to tell her, she\'d hear about it whether she wanted to or not.

Finally, Cynthia finished, nodding at Nana. Then, without having said a word, the girl left the room.

\"So, what was that about?\" she asked, just to fill the conversational void.

\"It\'s a bit paranoid, but there\'s been some suspicion that there was some kind of magical manipulation of the events on X‐25, so we\'ve been doing due diligence on the idea,\" Nana said.

She paused, leaving Meiqing to wonder if an empty‐sounding reason like that could really be believed.

\"Anyway, we also wanted to ask some questions about what you may have sensed while there, and also your inferences about the events that happened,\" Nana added a moment later.

\"Go ahead then, I suppose,\" Meiqing prompted, her eyes sliding over to the austere metal door that led into the room, before snapping back again.

The interview started, then dragged on, almost meaninglessly. The truth was, there was very little to talk about, and she couldn\'t imagine what it was Nana wanted from her. She had spent plenty of time thinking over the events of X‐25, even dreaming about them. There was no way around the conclusion that there was nothing she could have done to make things go differently, to spare the casualties they had inflicted early in the mission. Her therapist had even drilled this point home during their brief session on Earth, as if that fact would lessen the guilt she felt.

\"I know it bothers you,\" Nana said. \"It bothered me too, and I\'m old enough to know better. I can\'t help but think about what we could have done differently, if there was any way to know.\"

Meiqing looked up. She knew for a fact that Nana wasn\'t a mind‐reader, but then...

\"You totally zoned out on me there,\" Nana said, flipping her ponytail with one hand. \"It wasn\'t that hard to guess. I read your psych file. You\'ve mostly handled it fine, but what happened there bothers you.\"

Meiqing shrugged vaguely. It wasn\'t that there was no use denying it, more that... well, really, she just didn\'t know what to say.

\"What do you hope to find out from this interview?\" Meiqing asked instead. \"I know it might be improper to ask, but as far as I can tell this doesn\'t really serve any purpose.\"

\"What do you think the cultists were up to?\" Nana asked, ignoring Meiqing\'s question. \"I want your opinion.\"

She leaned forward onto the desk between them, pressuring Meiqing with her posture, even as Meiqing leaned back in her cushioned seat,

\"The leader was pretty definitive on that one, I think,\" Meiqing said, "even if it didn\'t really make sense. They probably had some vague idea about coming back to take down or at least expose Governance with an army of magical girls. People who know they want to do something, but fall down when it comes to actually executing. Not all that unusual. I guess they expected their faith to come through in the end.\"

\"That\'s rather dismissive,\" Nana commented neutrally. \"What do you think of the other parties that were involved in this?\"

\"They clearly helped talk them into it,\" Meiqing said. \"Though for what reason I can\'t imagine. It seems like the intent was that we\'d never find the stealthed base, because of the nuke. That suggests to me they wanted to do what the cultists were doing, without their role being revealed in it. I can only imagine they were interested in making magical girls from clones themselves.\"

\"Do you think Akemi Homura might have had something to do with it?\" Nana asked, watching Meiqing with a meaningful expression. \"After all, the Incubator claimed there was a statue of her there, and they are not known to lie.\"

Meiqing glanced around the room for a moment, uncomfortable with the aggressive question‐and‐answer rhythm of the conversation. She wasn\'t used to being drilled repeatedly like this.

Unfortunately for her, there weren\'t any answers embedded in the door, the ceiling, or the smooth work table they were seated at. There weren\'t even any ambient screens for her to look at.

\"I don\'t know what to think about that,\" Meiqing said. \"Officially, she\'s dead, but everyone knows she only disappeared. That being said, I have doubts she\'s really involved. Having a statue there is a bit much, isn\'t it? Everyone would have seen it, and the moment anyone was captured, we\'d know all about it. I doubt the real Homura would ever condone it.\"

\"Hmm,\" Nana said, making a show of looking at the floor thoughtfully. Meiqing had the sudden sense that they had entered the real meat of this "interview\", and felt just a tad nervous.

\"You weren\'t contracted when Homura was still around, though,\" Nana said. \"For that matter, you weren\'t even born when Homura was still around. That\'s a lot of guesses to make about her behavior.\"

Meiqing wavered, taken aback by the direct challenge.

\"Well, it\'s just a guess,\" she said, leaning forward onto the table herself. \"Homura was supposed to be super‐competent, right? And I can only guess that she wouldn\'t try a crazy magical girl cloning project like this, at least not without asking the Incubators about it first.\"

\"Then why do you think the statue was there?\" Nana asked.

Meiqing shrugged elaborately, wondering what Nana was digging at, and leaned back again.

\"I\'m not sure. It could be a deliberate red herring, but what kind of cult puts up a giant statue as a red herring? To mislead people in the future in case they get destroyed? That doesn\'t make sense. They must have had some kind of religious reason, but I can\'t imagine what. What did they say when asked?\"

The last question slipped out casually, in the course of thought, and only right after she said it did Meiqing realize that it could be taken as a probe for information, information she didn\'t explicitly have clearance for.

\"The future, yes,\" Nana mused inexplicably, without immediately acknowledging the question. \"Tell me, have you ever heard of a group called the Far Seers?\"

Meiqing searched Nana\'s eyes for a hint at what she was getting at, since the question seemed to come out of the blue, but found nothing of use.

\"No,\" Meiqing said, shaking her head to show she meant it. \"Or, at least, not really. There\'s rumors about a group like that on the Grapevine sometimes, but it\'s conspiracy theory‐type stuff. Nothing too solid. They\'re some kind of religious group?\"

\"Well, *they* wouldn\'t call themselves that, but some of those who know them might,\" Nana said cryptically. \"They\'re not publicized. A cabal of the MSY\'s best clairvoyants and other psychic‐type people, who convene on occasion to meditate on matters. This is for your ears only, by the way. The MSY isn\'t keen on too many knowing about them.\"

Meiqing made a perplexed, or perhaps just bemused, face. So this particular conspiracy theory was based on something real. Too bad she couldn\'t feed the information back to the rumor mill in good faith.

\"Well, if it weren\'t for the magic and MSY secrecy, they\'d sound kind of like a cult themselves,\" Meiqing said, hoping Nana wasn\'t herself a member of said organization. \"What do they meditate on?\"

\"Whatever they want,\" Nana said. \"Sometimes what others ask them to. Sometimes they organize little field trips. They\'re a very eclectic organization. You\'re probably wondering why I even brought them up.\"

\"I was... wondering that, yes,\" Meiqing admitted. She also wondered how this interview had gotten here, and what relationship any of this had to the supposed topic. It sounded interesting, but...

\"The Far Seers are a bit like the Oracle of Delphi,\" Nana said, \"in that they are insufferably vague. Apparently the Founders had high hopes for them when they were first formed, but the Far Seers have always been frustrated by what they claim is the universe\'s unwillingness to reveal its secrecy. A form of fate.\"

\"Uh huh,\" Meiqing said, watching Nana\'s hair bob up and down as she talked. There wasn\'t much else to say.

\"Nonetheless, they have proven useful at times,\" Nana said. \"Indeed, they suspect that their occasional truly startling insights are more than mere coincidence, and are perhaps driven by the overall pool of wish energy, or something like that.\"

\"Right,\" Meiqing echoed.

\"In any case, because of their history, the MSY often has occasion to consult them, particularly when it comes to important or mysterious matters such as the colony on X‐25.\"

Meiqing finally began to see the outlines of how this conversation was shaped, though she still wasn\'t sure where it was going.

\"And what did they say?\" she asked, bracing herself against the armrests of her chair. She had a sense the answer would be, as they say, a doozy.

\"A bit more than might usually be expected, actually,\" Nana said. "Even though, as is typical, it was nothing that clear. There are a lot of threads running through that planet, which they say they\'re still having difficulty untangling. They think Grigori really did see Homura at some point, though they have no idea what happened, and doubt she had anything directly to do with his cult. There were anywhere from two to five different entities with some kind of agenda on the planet, either in establishing it or in stopping it. At least two of those have more knowledge of the future than would otherwise seem to be possible. And.\"

Nana stopped seemingly mid‐sentence, as Meiqing was still thinking over "two to five entities\". What did that even mean?

\"And?\" Meiqing prompted, a moment later.

\"And they\'re convinced Homura had a hand in the selection of the team that entered the underground complex on X‐25, even though that seemed to be purely Kyouko\'s decision. She somehow made sure certain people were there, including me, which is an interesting thought when you consider how close to the edge we ran that operation. It would have taken only the slightest divergence for us to make a different decision and set off the nuclear device.\"

Meiqing felt a sudden chill run through her spine. One hardly had to be a seer to know the kind of things that might imply, and for the first time in the conversation she forgot about her odd surroundings.

\"If you\'re trying to ask whether I know anything about this, I don\'t,\" Meiqing said, shifting in her seat. \"All I know is I was on regular assignment, and then suddenly I\'m deployed instead on some secret rogue colony, reassigned to Kyouko\'s personal staff, fighting clones in an underground Spec Ops mission! I wasn\'t ready for *any* of it. If you don\'t believe me, you can ask my MHD psychiatrist!\"

Her tone came out harsher than she\'d expected, so she took a subtle breath to cool herself.

\"No, that\'s not what I\'m trying to ask,\" Nana said. \"We\'ve combed your actions before the mission through and through, and we have no reason to believe you\'re anything more than you seem. Nonetheless, the Far Seers are convinced that Homura, or more likely someone working for* her, managed to manipulate events so that you would be assigned to X‐25. We\'ve been auditing the decision‐making chain, but have not found anything of importance.\"

Nana paused, perhaps gauging Meiqing\'s reaction, before continuing.

\"But let\'s not get too sunk into an adversarial interview. I don\'t think you\'re hiding anything. I\'m just curious if there\'s anything you can think of that might answer some of these questions.\"

Meiqing took her time with her answer, embarrassed by her previous strong reaction. She tried to be methodical, using her TacComp to sort through her relevant memories. Akemi Homura was so distant from her that she might as well have been in another universe, and yet...

\"Well, honestly, the only thing I can think of is through Ryouko,\" Meiqing said. \"That\'s the main reason I think I ended up on the mission. Sure, I have earth powers, but I know there\'s at least a couple of others with similar skill sets. And I can\'t imagine that Kyouko would want to bring me if I weren\'t connected with Ryouko somehow, given... what Ryouko has told me about her beliefs.\"

She only touched upon the topic of the Cult, partially because she was unsure what Nana thought of it, and partially because Ryouko had never told her very much. What little she knew was gleaned from the occasional side comment and what Asami had told her. It was clear to her that, whatever the two of them told themselves about their Cult involvement, they were in deep. Deep enough that Ryouko seemed to think the supernatural was involved in the wormhole mission, and deep enough that the Cult leader was treating them like VIPs.

Meiqing herself didn\'t know what to think of that. She had never been a fan of religion---her family had steered *very* clear of it after the events of the Unification Wars, and the incident on X‐25 certainly hadn\'t changed her mind about religious people being a little... confused.

But she couldn\'t deny that recent events had left her more than a bit confused herself.

\"Hmm, yes, that\'s also the only thing we could think of,\" Nana said. "There\'s a fascinating chain of causality that runs through Ryouko, and involves a *lot* of people who are hard to investigate, Kyouko perhaps chief among them. We\'ve had difficulty working through it all. And, of course, she\'s my *niece*. I can\'t say I haven\'t noticed that unusual coincidence, especially given that the Seers are convinced Homura got me involved too. That\'s a bit disturbing, considering she was once my mentor, and I\'ve been trying to find her for twenty years.\"

Meiqing blinked at the seemingly casual revelation, starting to check reflexively over her shoulder. Was she supposed to be hearing this?

\"I\'ve never seen the Far Seers get so interested in a topic,\" Nana said. \"They\'re convinced something really big is going on, that there are *way* too many coincidences to be *just* coincidence. From what I\'ve been told, they\'re really mobilizing. I don\'t know what to make of it.\"

Nana smiled oddly.

\"I\'m not just leaking information like a sieve,\" Nana said. \"At least I hope I\'m not. I attended the last meeting myself. They gave me some very specific advice. They said I should hire you.\"

Instead of blinking this time, Meiqing kept her eyes open, searching Nana\'s face for any sign that she was joking, or that she herself had misunderstood.

\"Uh, hire me?\" she repeated. \"For what? Another mission?\"

Nana smiled, as if letting her in on a funny little secret, which, Meiqing supposed, she was.

\"No, for something more permanent. At this point you know far more than the average girl about the darker aspects of what we do. Especially after what happened at X‐25, and what I\'ve told you today, your training cycle will be a lot shorter than most, and I see from your file that you have no current mentors.\"

\"You want me to become a spy?\" Meiqing asked. \"Or some kind of specialist in rogue colonies? I don\'t want to be involved in anything dirty, any more killing of civilians. I\'ve had enough of that for a long while, I think.\"

\"No, no assassination missions or anything like that,\" Nana said. "I\'m primarily in an investigatory arm of the organization, and your role won\'t be anything too terribly crucial---more like an intern or assistant than anything. But, I can\'t promise no violence, or no killing. As you saw yourself, being in an investigatory arm didn\'t stop me from being involved in X‐25.\"

Perhaps seeing the hesitation and unhappiness on Meiqing\'s face, Nana seemed to pause thoughtfully, considering what to say next.

\"Let me tell you something that my own mentor told me once, back when I was your age.\"

\"Homura?\" Meiqing asked automatically, before regretting the interruption.

\"Yes, her,\" Nana replied, without seeming fazed. \"She told me that many people, including many who should know better, think that intelligence work is only for the callous, and the cold‐hearted. In truth, that\'s a bit like saying that finance should only be done by the greedy, or combat by the bloodthirsty. Those are the people who *want to do it, but not the only ones who *should* do it.\"

\"What are you saying?\" Meiqing asked.

\"I\'m saying that I think of the reservations you have as a good sign, provided that you\'re otherwise suited for the work, even though you probably don\'t see it that way. I did have my eye on you, a little, but you would ordinarily be way too young and inexperienced, even for an assistant\'s role. Then again, I suppose Homura took a chance on me when I was young too.\"

\"Are you saying I should do something like this even though I wouldn\'t enjoy it?\" Meiqing asked. \"That\'s quite a sacrifice to ask of me.\"

\"I\'m not saying you wouldn\'t enjoy it. Just that you shouldn\'t have to relish the parts of the job that are bad.\"

Nana shook her head.

\"I have to say, there are many girls who would jump at something that sounds as fantastic as a posting in the Black Heart under me. When the Far Seers suggested I try this, I assumed that meant you would consent easily. But, I\'m not interested in forcing you, Far Seers or not.\"

\"Tell me why I would want to do this, then,\" Meiqing asked.

\"You would make a difference,\" Nana said. \"Just like you did on X‐25. It won\'t always feel good, it will often feel like you\'re not doing enough... but you will sometimes feel like you\'re making the world a better place. Perhaps more than you would facing the aliens in combat.\"

She was ready to say something skeptical, something to cool Nana\'s obvious certainty that she would accept, but something made her stop and turn the thought over in her head a few times.

It wasn\'t as if she thought she wasn\'t making a difference here, but... for better or worse, she had come to realize that the service was a form of solace for her, something to get away from her demons at home. There, she always felt like she wasn\'t living up to the family name, that she wasn\'t doing her part to redeem it, even if her parents themselves never pressured her that way. Out here...

Well, no one would ever question someone who got herself seriously injured in the war.

She was too practical and realistic not to know her own problems, but too caught up in them to be able to escape. The inclination was self‐destructive, but...

\"Can I have time to think about it?\" she asked, choosing the safest option. \"It\'s a big decision, so I\'d appreciate the time.\"

\"Of course,\" Nana said, nodding, smiling slightly. \"That is entirely reasonable. I\'ll leave you a virtual address, and you can give me a decision within, maybe, two weeks? I\'d hate to rush you.\"

\"That\'s fine,\" Meiqing said.

Nana seemed to think for a moment, then continued:

\"Alright, well, I have a few other questions...\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"*Do you remember what you said to me once, Homura?*\"

*Yuma\'s own voice sounded odd to her, and it took only a moment for her to realize that this was a deeper voice, an older voice, one she hadn\'t used for a long while.*

*She was dreaming, then, and the fact mildly surprised her. It was rare that she slept, and even now part of her still thrummed along in consciousness, observing matters quietly.*

\"*You\'re being vague,*\" *Homura said, in that straightforward way of hers.* \"*What I said* when*?*\"

*Yuma took a moment to look around, not yet ready to continue the topic. Pieces of the world came into focus as she examined them: the polished steel of the elevator, the impassive composite visor‐plates of their trio of armed bodyguards, the logo that was stenciled onto their armor, and even into the elevator walls. It was abstract and blue, a projection of Earth as seen from the North Pole, embraced by the branches of an olive tree, all of it in front of a symbolically‐drawn shield, meant to represent protection and defense.*

*In these days, it would have been appropriate for the EDC logo to incorporate a sword, and maybe a few lightning bolts, she thought.*

\"*All those years ago, when we were young,*\" *she said.* \"*When I needed reassurance about my family.*\"

*The guards continued to stand impassively. They were technically her guards, two fully briefed TNCs and one* bona fide *MSY member, dressed in armor she didn\'t need. Bodyguards assigned to defend an Emergency Defense Commissioner, EDC.Vigilance.Controller, classified personal name Nonaka Kuroe. Or Chitose Yuma, to her friends.*

\"*Let\'s wait a little on that topic,*\" *Homura said, quite reasonably. The topic of her* family, *the Southern Group, was secret even to the guards.*

*So they waited in silence, each lost in their own thoughts, until they reached the bottom of the shaft. A part of Yuma knew what the place would be like: claustrophobic and dimly lit, all bare synthetic concrete and surveillance cameras, and visored guards to scan them all thoroughly, *but in the dream her mind focused only on one particular detail, a small sign in front of her that said:*

> *Maximum Security, Special Prisoners, Section 001*

*They kept walking past the checkpoint, shedding their bodyguards as they entered the long, narrow hallway, illuminated by a single row of lights set into the ceiling. This secured zone was one of the EDC\'s blackest locations, among other reasons because it was one of the only places where MSY involvement in EDC affairs was acknowledged, and where more than merely mundane security was explicitly provided.*

*Yuma took a breath to prepare what she was going to say.*

\"*You told me once about a divine figure you believed in, a Goddess of magical girls, even, who watched over us all and gave our lives meaning,*\" *she said.*

*She focused on Homura\'s expression, which remained nearly impassive even as they stopped and faced each other in the hallway. Homura* had reacted, though, even though she was trying not to show it.*

\"*Do you deny it?*\" *Yuma pushed, a moment later.*

\"*Of course not,*\" *Homura said.* \"*That\'s not even the only time I talked about Her. But why bring that up now? What does that have to do with anything?*\"

\"*Can you really still believe in all that, after all we\'ve seen?*\" Yuma asked.* \"*After all that has happened? What kind of Goddess allows any of this to happen?*\"

*Homura turned her head away, and Yuma could see in her eyes that she had struck some kind of chord, even if her expression showed only mild surprise.*

\"*It\'s so rare for you to talk about these sorts of questions,*\" Homura said.* \"*You\'re usually so committed to the work.*\"

\"*I\'m committed to the work because the work* matters*,*\" *Yuma said.* \"*But that doesn\'t mean I can\'t think about other things. Like what the purpose of all this is, or what kind of world we\'re even making here. I don\'t think I ever told you, but what you said to me really mattered. It gave me something to think about, even if I didn\'t really believe you.*\"

*Yuma expected Homura to say something acid about how her Goddess didn\'t need anyone to believe in her, or else to put on an air of impassiveness, in the way that was so unique to her, but instead Homura turned to the blank gray wall and placed her hand onto the surface.*

\"*It makes me glad to know that someone else has thought about it,*\" she said.* \"*The truth is, I\'m worried as well. I had thought she would never let us suffer so much, or so long, but here we are. I have tried to ask her about it, but I haven\'t heard from her in many years, and what little she shows me... I think she\'s ashamed to see me.*\"

*Yuma blinked. She hadn\'t expected* this *response.*

\"*Ashamed?*\" *Yuma asked, taken aback.* \"*Do you think She\'s being held back somehow? Or that She\'s not powerful enough?*\"

*It felt faintly absurd to talk about Homura\'s Goddess as if she were real, complete with spoken capital letters, but it was Yuma who had started this topic in the first place. And... well, it was neither polite nor a good idea to disdain someone\'s religion. Especially not Homura\'s, given who she was.*

*Homura turned away from the wall, facing forward once again.*

\"*Not that,*\" *Homura said, reaching back to adjust the ribbon in her hair, a nervous tell.* \"*Not that at all. I think She\'s letting it happen, that it\'s all for the best somehow.*\"

\"*For the best?*\" *Yuma said, not bothering to hide the hint of incredulity in her voice.*

\"*The two of us have had to do a few terrible things for the greater good,\" Homura said, starting to walk down the narrow hallway once more.* \"*Why wouldn\'t the same be true for Her? For someone like Her, the terrible and the good must be on a truly immense scale, perhaps balanced so far apart we cannot see. But I would be lying if I said it didn\'t bother me, since I had always hoped to protect her...*\"

*Homura\'s voice trailed off, and Yuma knew it was a sign she didn\'t want to finish the thought. The rank and file of the MSY thought Akemi Homura unreadable, but no one was unreadable to their friends. That was a simple truth of life.*

\"*So what then?*\" *Yuma asked, following Homura down the hallway. "*Are we supposed to just believe that? Just accept that She works in mysterious ways? What do we do then?*\"

\"*You think I know?*\" *Homura asked, voice cold.* \"*There\'s only one thing we* can *do, which is keep up our work, to the best of our judgment. There is nothing we can do but our best, whatever the price. You\'re the last person who needs me to explain that.*\"

*Yuma didn\'t respond right away, instead shaking her head unhappily. Homura was welcome to her life philosophy, of course, but the fact was that it was just a bit... unnervingly intense. Self‐sacrificing, as well. To the point that many wondered how it was she stayed sane, or whether she still was.*

*Yuma didn\'t think she was insane at all, which was really even more troubling, considering this Goddess question.*

*She eyed the rows of reinforced cell doors they now passed, built to house the EDC\'s most important prisoners, former FA generals and magnates. Magical girls, too, which was why the hallway glowed in her mind\'s eye with powerful magic.*

\"*Let\'s carry on with the work, then,*\" *she said, words deliberately chosen as they stopped in front of one particular cell door. They both knew what was inside, and why they were here.*

*The door hissed slightly as it unsealed itself, the sound sinister and menacing in a deeply emotional way only possible in dreams.*

\"*The queen herself,*\" *a voice inside the cell commented loudly, before the door had even finished opening.* \"*I didn\'t think you\'d deign to visit me.*\"

*The former Zhou matriarch, Zhou Zhi Yi, watched them as they entered, languid gaze concealing a core of acrid hate. She sat, legs crossed, next to a small table and prison‐style bed. There were no bonds, no mistreatment, and even a small basket of fruit on the table. While both MSY and UF had far nastier establishments, VIPs languished in relative comfort.*

*Why not? Mistreating valuable prisoners only risked injuring them, and there were ways of making someone talk on both the magical and mundane side of things that involved no torture whatsoever. There was no risk of escape, either---after two centuries of experimentation, the MSY had learned to confine its members securely, by the expedient of confiscating their soul gem and placing it under the constant watch of a soul mage. A laborious and expensive undertaking, but manageable for small periods of time. It also ensured that suicide was quite difficult.*

\"*So what is it that you\'re here for?*\" *Zhi Yi asked, without standing up for them.* \"*Information? Some kind of deal? Cooperation? Or are you here to say goodbye?*\"

\"*Just a visit,*\" *Homura said, without the slightest sign of being fazed.* \"*We thought it might be worth talking to you.*\"

\"*It\'s always about just talking with you,*\" *Zhi Yi said, tersely. "*That was always the problem. Neither of you would or could ever see beyond the tips of your noses to try anything unorthodox, anything other than the most vanilla utilitarianism. Otherwise, we wouldn\'t have had this war.*\"

\"*It doesn\'t matter who you think started this war,*\" *Homura said, with a hint of menace.* \"*It matters what side you chose once it started. We chose the more moral side, you chose the other one. After all that has happened, that\'s what really matters.*\"

*Yuma stayed silent, watching the two veterans trade words. They\'d been political allies in the past, advocating policies of aggressive expansion, heavy investment in research and development, and stockpiling of resources in case of global instability. But in the later days, Lady Zhou had grown distant, pushing for investments into projects the leadership would not condone: experimental implants, the interaction of human cloning and contract potential, the manipulation of emotions to control demon spawns. They had thought her only a malcontent, unhappy with restrictive regulation. No one had expected her to defect when the war started.*

*Homura was talking about it at that very moment, in fact, listing out Zhou\'s many crimes with a chilling terseness. Besides merely aiding the design and manufacture of the infamous FA Elites, she had pursued the very experiments she and her family had been denied earlier, but further. Further than any of them had ever wanted to imagine.*

\"*I want to know* why*,*\" *Yuma said finally, interrupting.* \"*Why do all this? What purpose can it serve? I don\'t believe you did it just to know. It\'s never just about the science. Not with you.*\"

*Zhi Yi pursed her lips, even as Homura stood back up straight, ending her tirade in favor of waiting for the response.*

\"*None of your mind rapists told you?*\" *Zhi Yi asked.* \"*I would have thought they would know, given that afterward it felt like I had been scraped clean with a rusty knife.*\"

\"*We wanted to spare our telepaths any undue time stuck inside a mind like yours,*\" *Yuma said.* \"*So they were told to focus on concrete information. They can always come back if necessary.*\"

\"*Not exactly a veiled threat,*\" *Zhi Yi commented, pouring herself some water from the pitcher on the table.* \"*But I guess there\'s no value in that. I was offended you chose to send them in the first place. I know better than to try to resist. I\'ve seen the footage.*\"

\"*I\'m sure you have,*\" *Homura said acidly.* \"*After all, the so‐called Freedom Alliance is hardly above using the same techniques on our own operatives. You helped make sure of that.*\"

*Neither of them chose to sit, even as Zhi Yi poured out more cups of water. Whatever fond memories either of them might have had of rosier times would have to stay just that: memories, to be locked up in a box in Yuma\'s heart where she could throw away the key until after the war. After it was* all *finally over.*

\"*And you would also know we can\'t just trust the word of someone like you,\" Yuma said.* \"*A mind‐read is the only way to really be sure.*\"

\"*Foolish sentimentality, perhaps,*\" *Homura said.* \"*Enough stalling. Are you going to say something or not? As Yuma said, we can easily bring the telepaths back.*\"

\"*You can\'t still think that Humanity is fit to rule itself?*\" *Zhi Yi said.* \"*You might pay lip service to the idea, but if it were any more than lip service, I wouldn\'t be speaking to an EDC Commissioner right now, would I? You never were as good at thinking in the long‐term as you like to pretend.*\"

\"*We intend to rule in partnership with Humanity, unlike what you planned,\" Homura said.* \"*Was that what this is all about? Some sick plot to replace Humanity with cheap cloned drones? Where will we get new magical girls then? Or even demons to hunt? Have you thought about these questions?*\"

\"*I\'m insulted you think I would be so stupid,*\" *Zhi Yi said, placing her hand on the table, matching ice with ice.* \"*No, magical girls and Humanity are symbiotic. We take care of them, and they feed us. That\'s the only relationship that\'s stable. But as long as Humanity has its flaws---as long as we have* our *flaws---it will never be truly stable. Long‐term stability is a myth, antithetical to the nature of our existence. We will destroy ourselves, unless the Incubators finally deign to rule over us directly. With infinite time, this is certain.* That *is entropy.*\"

\"*And you want to fix these flaws?*\" *Yuma asked.* \"*With these Elites*?*\"

\"*The Elites were a tool, nothing more,*\" *Zhi Yi said.* \"*But the research was not. The Incubators will never let us fix our flaws, because our flaws are what give us our power. Ironic, that. But there is no need to let those who are flawed comprise the entirety of the species. It is a matter of specialization. A small class of normal humans, raised and pampered in the Matriarchies, to carry forth our legacy. A majority---the* vast *majority---made efficient, to keep our society and civilization stable. And a small group, a* very tiny *group, as small as we can make it, designed from birth to spawn as many demons as possible.*\"

\"*You mean suffer,*\" *Yuma said, feeling the stirrings of horror slip through her carefully controlled demeanor, even again through the dream itself.* \"*Human minds, designed to* suffer, *despite the euphemisms you choose to use. Just listen to yourself. You sound sick.*\"

\"*If you insist on saying that,*\" *Zhi Yi said.* \"*But if you\'ve read my studies, if you\'ve looked at the files you\'ve surely captured, you know it\'s the only stable arrangement, once you factor in the Incubators. Otherwise, any attempt to make Humanity at large healthy, happy, and immortal will eventually incur a counterbalance to restore the necessary energy production. Better that the suffering, the chaos, be confined to a few, rather than be laid upon us all, leading to the inevitable destruction of the race. It\'s there in the math.*\"

\"*I\'ve heard enough,*\" *Homura said, turning sharply away to head out of the room, motioning for Yuma to follow.*

\"*Oh my, the famous ice queen, unable to be rational?*\" *Zhi Yi taunted.* \"*What\'s the matter? Still relying on your Goddess to save you? Well, maybe I should have given her more credit, considering---*\"

*The door mercifully sealed shut behind them, and Yuma could finally let out an angry cry, though she couldn\'t quite punch any of the walls, lest it set off some of the magical defenses.*

\"*What the hell was that?*\" *she asked finally.*

\"*Madness,*\" *Homura said simply.* \"*Everyone who has ever studied these topics too deeply seems to succumb to it. I\'m starting to think it\'s a curse; we were right to bar the telepaths from digging into her motives. This is a clear Five‐Seven‐Three.*\"

*Yuma nodded vaguely. The words \"Five‐Seven‐Three\", so ominous to those in the know at the beginning of the war, had almost lost their shock value.*

*She felt like she had to say something, give some voice to the unease that gnawed at her.*

\"*She\'s sick, Homura,*\" *Yuma said.* \"*You called it madness yourself. I know the MHD isn\'t capable of saving everyone, but...*\"

*She stopped there, unsure how to continue. Where exactly was that train of thought leading? What exactly could she propose?*

*Part of her expected a sharp rebuke from Homura, something cutting about Yuma going soft now in the face of a war criminal, but Homura instead shook her head, and showed a glimmer of sadness.*

\"*We have no choice. You know that,*\" *Homura said.* \"*Our fate, our duty is to have this all rest on our souls, rather than the souls of others. We cannot let it grow too heavy to bear.*\"

*With that cryptic missive, Homura turned on a dime and headed back down the hallway, Yuma trailing.*

*They were otherwise silent on the walk back, except for the few words Yuma said to the guard at the doorway. He pressed a concealed button, and the rock wall next to him revealed itself to be an illusion, the doorway sliding open a moment later.*

*Inside, a huddle of girls and women stood over a small collection of sealed transparent containers, glowing with the radiance of a dozen souls. Another group could be seen through a glass door, enjoying themselves in a recreation area as they waited for their shift.*

\"*Director?*\" *one of the older‐looking ones asked, glancing between the two of them.*

\"*We have everything we need from Prisoner Number One,*\" *Homura said, clasping her hands behind her back.* \"*I\'m invoking Five‐Seven‐Three authority.*\"

\"*I see,*\" *the woman said, with an equally even expression. Both of them were doing their best to project an air of objective calm.*

*Yuma looked back and forth between the magical girls standing in the room, at Homura with her impassive, crystal eyes, at the older woman with her hard, brittle smile, at the others with their varying expressions of concealed shock, She saw souls, souls that encased themselves in ever‐firmer cages of steel and crystal, seeking invincibility even as their brilliance, their luster, faded to a dull permanent glow.*

\"*Let me do it,*\" *Yuma said, remembering what Homura had said.* \"*If I\'m going to have this on my conscience, let\'s not just dress it up in formality and delegation. This is no routine matter; it should never be routine.*\"

*She could see the surprise and shock on the faces of most present, though Homura merely arched an eyebrow at her.*

Are you sure? *Homura thought privately.* There\'s no requirement---

\"*I\'m sure,*\" *Yuma said out loud.* \"*I was the one who did this first, after all. Why do you think it\'s a ceremonial hammer? As magical girls, our responsibility is to face the darkness, not hide from it. Let us do it with eyes open.*\"

*Her voice rose to accentuate her words, words she wished deeply to be true.*

*The soul mage in front of her glanced around the room, then nodded, reaching out to grab the soul gem box from a robotic arm that now extended from the table.*

*With a hint of reverence, she placed it on a small pedestal that was in the process of emerging from the floor, ducking her head slightly. The fact that the vestiges of ceremony were still respected was a deliberate tactic, to make sure no one got inured to this. It was* always *a big deal, however much it helped one\'s mindset to pretend otherwise.*

*She opened the box, setting the soul gem carefully on the pedestal.*

\"*May the Goddess have mercy on her soul,*\" *Homura commented, as Yuma summoned her hammer in a ripple of green.*

\"*Amen,*\" *Yuma said, raising her hammer above her shoulder.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There it ended, as it always did, with a decisive shatter that seemed to force her awake. Well‐timed, too---Yuma needed to collect some of her attention back, since she was receiving a new, particularly interesting message. She wasn\'t ordinarily informed about new contractees, but this one was different, involving a girl who had somehow slipped off her radar, one who had apparently hidden her contract for quite some time, a puzzle her agents hadn\'t yet managed to solve.

Simona del Mago was an enigma. Perhaps she would be less of one now.

\"I hope you appreciate that it wasn\'t easy for me to bring her in,\" Shizuki Sayaka said, stretching her arms out in front of her playfully. The matriarch seemed happy, even bouncy, striding forward in a green‐and‐white sundress that was wildly inappropriate for the season---or rather, would have been, if this were anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere except the catacombs of Paris.

Yuma resisted the urge to shake her head at the woman\'s obvious pleasure, or to peer upwards at Sayaka\'s much greater height. For whatever reason, Sayaka had chosen to adopt a much older age than usual, a cheerful adult rather than a haughty teenager.

\"Oh, this?\" Sayaka asked rhetorically, placing a hand on the shamelessly deep cleavage of her dress. \"I\'ve got a big family function coming up, and I think it helps to look a bit older, if only for my own mentality. Makes me feel like a *matriarch*, you know?\"

Yuma smiled despite herself, even as she felt a twinge of annoyance at Sayaka so successfully reading her thoughts from her expression. Meeting Sayaka was so refreshing compared to Mami\'s prim propriety, Kyouko\'s affected guilelessness, and Kana\'s graveness. Sayaka had a bit of bubbliness in her demeanor, especially when around those she liked, that wasn\'t *entirely* an act. It reminded Yuma of something she herself had long lost, and she was glad Sayaka had retained it, even after what had happened to her first daughter.

Now, Sayaka had the catlike smile of someone immensely pleased with herself, someone who had somehow managed to scoop the vaunted Kuroi Kana and Chitose Yuma on a matter of importance. She always delighted in subterfuge, even if her family connections and other inclinations pulled her irreversibly into the world of MSY finance and politics instead.

\"Alright, I\'ll bite,\" Yuma said. \"How is it that you managed to find Simona del Mago?\"

\"One sec,\" Sayaka said, stopping to lean over and whisper something into the ear of one of her attendants.

That gave Yuma the opportunity to stop and appreciate the view. Sayaka had always had a sense of style, a mostly impeccable sense of taste that balanced precariously on the edge of garishness. That applied to this courtyard, a neoclassical affair full of columns that opened up onto a rolling, hilly landscape, full of nestled cottages and lowing cows. Or, in other words, a giant manor slapped right into the middle of an underground French countryside.

It was beautiful though, the artificial sunlight filtering through a set of carefully‐placed trees to land dappled onto finely‐wrought benches and a pond full of rippling fish. Some of it illuminated Sayaka\'s hair as it streamed over her back, and Yuma couldn\'t help but be reminded of another haughty, wealthy, and charming girl she had once known.

\"I\'ll never understand why you use runners in this day and age,\" Yuma commented, as the teenager hurried away from them back into the building.

Sayaka shrugged vaguely.

\"There\'s a lot of answers to that. But anyway, Simona.\"

She paused mid‐stride, considering the question one last time.

\"Lots of luck, but I was also prepared and paying attention,\" Sayaka said. \"The luck was that I came across her in the first place, when I was helping fight that suspicious demon swarm in Paris. You remember that?\"

\"Yes,\" Yuma said. \"I didn\'t look into it much myself, but there were two magical girls involved who never registered with the system. One of them was you...\"

\"And the other was Simona, yes,\" Sayaka finished, relishing the presentation of the story even though she knew damn well Yuma had read the file she had sent.

\"No one else tried too hard to track down either of us, but I was suspicious, given the circumstances,\" Sayaka said. \"*I* knew why I was staying unregistered, but what was the *other* girl doing there? For all I knew, she caused the power outage. So I tracked her, based on her fire patterns.\"

\"And you cornered her,\" Yuma cued, watching Sayaka gesture extravagantly to lay out the scene, standing next to a blossom‐laden vine crawling up a nearby column.

\"Of course,\" Sayaka said. \"You don\'t reach my age without learning enough skills to outmaneuver someone new to the trade, unless they have teleportation or something like that.\"

\"And you waited until now to say anything,\" Yuma commented tersely, asking for the first time a question that wasn\'t answered in the report.

\"I didn\'t get the sense she was an enemy,\" Sayaka said, adopting a more serious demeanor and leaning against the column. \"To get her to talk at all, I promised not to break her cover.\"

\"And then you let her go,\" Yuma said, with a hint of reproach.

\"Yes.\"

\"You\'re very trusting.\"

\"She came back, didn\'t she?\" Sayaka countered, making a sour expression. \"I made a judgment call. I would have taken responsibility if I had been wrong.\"

Yuma didn\'t bother challenging that, even though she suspected Sayaka would have had her Matriarchy launch a giant manhunt first, before ever admitting she had screwed up.

She shook her head to show her exasperation.

\"Alright then, what did she say?\"

Sayaka closed her eyes, smiling slightly.

\"She said that she wasn\'t an enemy, and that she had been sent there to tail Shizuki Ryouko and make sure she didn\'t come to harm in the demon attack. In her words, it was a potential inflection point that had to be monitored.\"

Inflection point. Now that was terminology Yuma had heard before, in an entirely different context.

\"And what did you tell her? How did you convince her to cooperate?\" Yuma asked.

Sayaka shifted slightly, perhaps uneasily.

\"Well, to tell the truth I didn\'t have to do very much convincing. She was definitely surprised I caught up with her, but she was also... less surprised than I would have expected. She also clearly didn\'t want to fight me.\"

\"No one sane and less than three hundred would,\" Yuma said, shaking her head. \"But you\'re being too vague. There\'s telling a story and then there\'s just holding things back.\"

\"That\'s not my intent,\" Sayaka said neutrally, turning her head as her attendant returned to whisper something in her ear. \"It\'s just that it\'s still something I\'m thinking through myself, and that\'s why I didn\'t mention it in the report I gave you.\"

Sayaka hesitated, just a little, before continuing:

\"I didn\'t really *convince* her to cooperate, not really. She said she\'d have information for me, important information, but not yet. I just needed to let her go.\"

\"And you did,\" Yuma said. \"Again, I find that rather dubious.\"

\"So I did a bit of a mind‐read, okay?\" Sayaka sighed. \"Not my specialty, if I\'m being honest, but I thought it was a worth a shot. She let me in a little. That\'s why I trusted her.\"

\"Uh‐huh,\" Yuma said. \"And you didn\'t put this in the report either.\"

Sayaka shook her head unhappily.

\"I knew you\'d be skeptical. But the easiest way to finish this conversation is to just take you to her. You can ask your questions to the girl herself. I\'m curious myself, since she hasn\'t told me very much.\"

She nodded at her attendant, who curtsied and gestured for them to follow. Yuma mentally rolled her eyes at the triviality of it all.

*Can she be trusted?* Yuma thought, at Sayaka.

*I\'d trust Aliana with my immortal life,* Sayaka thought. *Though for your reassurance, I\'d have you know I insist on psychically screening my close attendants, just in case. Also helps when picking out life partners.*

*I\'m not sure how to feel about that,* Yuma commented.

The attendant led them into a side alcove of the courtyard, manually opening an oaken door to reveal a vine‐laden portico that led directly up to a stone and marble bridge. An ornate columned archway was erected across the entrance, which was only wide enough for two people to enter at once. Beyond that, the bridge itself reached forward far into the distance in front of them, a walkway that stretched impossibly across an underground gorge of massive scale, converging smoothly to the vanishing point on the horizon.

\"It\'s intended to feel a bit magical,\" Sayaka said, raising one hand. "Sort of elvish. The idea is that by crossing the bridge you make a journey to a beautiful new land. The family keeps a honeymoon suite on the other side, and we send newlyweds down the walkway with a little ceremony. Well, the ones who like this sort of thing.\"

Again, Yuma tried to avoid rolling her eyes, even as she laid one hand on the smooth and oddly warm stone handrail, just in case.

\"It\'s not *really* that far,\" Sayaka said, *sotto voce.* \"It\'s a nice holographic effect, but you\'ll find yourself getting there sooner than you expect. Even I might struggle getting *that* much space in underground Paris.\"

*She\'s offering a deal,* Yuma thought, returning to the previous topic. An interesting idea, someone in her position offering a deal to* us.

*You came, didn\'t you?* Sayaka pointed out.

*Well, yes, it\'s not every day someone from the outside tells us about our own black projects. Even if all she was offering was how she knew, that alone might be enough. The other ways of getting information out of a natural telepath are often... inexact.*

Yuma stepped awkwardly onto the bridge. The railing wasn\'t meant for someone of her childish stature, and forced her to keep her arm at an uncomfortable angle. She could have walked without it, but...

Seeing her hesitating, Sayaka grabbed her other hand, flashing the briefest of smiles at her.

Yuma snorted in annoyance. She was being patronized, she knew, because if she accepted the offer she would end up walking hand‐in‐hand with the much taller Sayaka down the bridge, looking for all the world like a mother and child.

She shrugged slightly. There was no one here to see them except Sayaka\'s attendant, who had stopped in front of them, looking back to see what the hold‐up was.

Yuma took her hand off the railing and smiled back winningly at Sayaka. There were worse fates than being coddled.

The attendant hid her expression and continued down the walkway, the two of them in tow. A waterfall roared somewhere in the distance.

*So, speaking of telepaths, do you have any of them here to guard us? Yuma asked. *Us old ones are resilient to that kind of thing, but you can never be too careful about wish‐derived mind magics.*

*Of course,* Sayaka thought. *Kana isn\'t the only one with espionage resources, even if that* is *her thing.*

There was a brief moment of silence as they both remembered that the Shizuki family had once been a meaningful, if weaker, rival in that field. Sayaka had lost her stomach for it, and no one could blame her for that.

*So that\'s why you\'re keeping her in the honeymoon suite?* Yuma asked.

*It\'s actually quite heavily monitored,* Sayaka thought. *And no one is allowed in normally, other than the loving couple. I like to keep my containment facilities classy and non‐obvious.*

Yuma chose not to comment that, strictly speaking, no matriarchy should have anything that could be described as a \"containment facility\".

\"Well, we\'re almost there,\" Yuma said out loud as a stately, almost Tolkien‐esque manor at the edge of the cliff loomed into view. A large waterfall---a different one from the one she had heard earlier---thundered off the cliffside directly next to the building.

She paused for a moment to take a more detailed look. She had already perceived the trick to the infinite‐seeming bridge: the hologram that projected in front of pedestrians brought objects into perspective just* a tiny bit earlier than it should have. She wouldn\'t bring that up, though, or else Sayaka was certain to say something about Yuma spending too much time with computers.

\"Goodness, I have no idea how anyone would honeymoon here,\" Yuma said instead. \"It\'s so loud you could never sleep.\"

\"I don\'t think anyone is really intended to *sleep* here,\" Sayaka said dryly. \"But in all seriousness, there\'s modern sound insulation installed. I commissioned the place, after all.\"

Yuma nodded genially, proceeding forward to the oaken double doors that were obviously intended as the main entrance, where the attendant was already waiting.

With a twist of the doorknob they stepped into the mansion, and Yuma\'s attention was drawn briefly by the stone and marble statuary, and by the achingly beautiful crystal ceiling, which cast filtered light down upon the atrium in a soft cascade of natural colors. She had always had a soft spot for such scenery, the way it reminded her of the nature she had loved as a child, and of sunlit rooms a lifetime ago, or perhaps in a past life.

If it were possible to leave the work, for her to leave behind all that she had built, she might have disappeared into the forest, she thought. She did not know exactly why she wanted this---she was tired of Humanity, perhaps, and preferred the endless expanses of the wilderness, or else of the electronic world. A contradiction, perhaps.

\"There\'s no open datalinks here,\" she said, eyeing Sayaka. \"Only an emergency connection.\"

*Not very different from the catacombs of St. Barbara,* she thought to herself.

\"This is meant to be a place of reflection as well as joy,\" Sayaka said, ducking her head. \"And the occasional unmentionable party, I admit. I think you can guess why I might keep a mystery girl here.\"

Yuma nodded, following the attendant\'s lead onto a stone staircase pockmarked with apparent age, grasping an oddly‐warm railing. The staircase turned as it headed upward, past a central statue of a young woman holding the world aloft on her back, surrounded by smaller girls bearing offerings.

Sayaka was showing this girl a lot of trust, she thought. No easy means of communication meant no secret messages, but also no notification when someone left the premises and vanished into the underground forest. Sayaka might have had surveillance installed around the perimeter, but somehow Yuma doubted that.

The attendant stopped at the top of the staircase, gesturing for Yuma to continue forward. Now Yuma felt something different: the soul gem of a magical girl, neither active with magic nor concealed in stealth. Just there*, and Yuma could have found it earlier, had she been looking.

This section of the second floor led forward onto another balcony, this one presenting a view of dark forest. In front of that it held a small bubbling fountain, and a brown‐skinned girl seated on a couch reading Notre‐Dame de Paris* out of a leather‐bound book.

It didn\'t surprise Yuma that Sayaka kept a paper library around. Many of her generation did.

\"How do you like it?\" Yuma asked, deciding that a friendly, social question would be a good way to probe the girl. Plus, she was curious---it was not often you got one of the younger generation to read a real book.

\"It\'s not one of my favorites,\" Simona said, without looking up. "It\'s pretty grim, but I\'ve read it more than once anyway. Something about the way the characters interact, each trying to reach their own goals, really speaks to me.\"

\"Uh‐huh,\" Yuma voiced. \"What about Quasimodo? What is his goal?\"

\"Well, that\'s the kicker, isn\'t it?\" Simona said. \"But, besides him, there\'s also the villain. He doesn\'t really start off as one, but he turns into one in the end.\"

\"I would have found it more instructive if he had thought of himself as proceeding with the best intentions the whole time,\" Yuma said. \"But, of course, that\'s probably not what the novelist was going for. I\'m surprised you\'ve read anything at all, though, to be honest.\"

Simona set the book aside and looked up at her.

\"I\'ve... had a lot of time to read, since I have to be careful about when I access the official networks.\"

\"Indeed,\" Yuma said. She changed her tone subtly, signaling to the other girl that she was ready to get to business, whatever it was.

\"I know you will be skeptical about whatever I have to say,\" Simona said. \"I don\'t expect otherwise. But you\'ll listen, at least? Free information, or at least what I want you to believe, right?\"

Yuma tilted her head to the right, catching Sayaka\'s eye, then dropped herself into the couch next to Simona and leaned forward with her head in her hands.

\"Alright, *nee‐chan*, I\'m listening,\" she said.

\"The people I\'m working for are not your enemy,\" Simona said, in flawless idiomatic Japanese, sitting up and clasping her hands carefully. \"We had nothing to do with what was done on X‐25, no hand in attempting to kill Sakura Kyouko, or any of the attempts on Shizuki Ryouko. Indeed, we have been active in helping save her, on more than one occasion.\"

\"That demon swarm in Paris,\" Sayaka said.

\"Yes, and we think that was the fault of our mutual enemies. They really do not like Shizuki‐san. Indeed, one of my assignments has been to keep an eye on her whenever she is on Earth, which isn\'t frequently.\"

\"But why should we believe you, *nee‐chan*?\" Yuma asked, pretending to look away at a spot among the trees. \"You can tell us whatever you want, but that doesn\'t prove it. What can you give us that will make more extreme verification measures unnecessary?\"

Simona looked uncomfortable for a moment, seeming to gather herself. Her fingers tapped nervously on the book next to her.

\"I will submit myself willingly to a full soul mage examination,\" she said. \"I came here prepared for this step, and to take this risk. But you will not get my end of the deal freely, since I do not *have* that proof, only how to get it. I only have one condition, which I think you\'ll be willing to keep.\"

\"That is?\" Yuma asked.

\"That whatever results you get are retrieved by your most trusted agent, and pass only your eyes and hers before anyone else,\" Simone said. \"We\'re taking a bet that when you see some of our secrets, you will see the value of keeping them secret yourself. Part of the value for us here is the convincing of *you*.\"

\"Well, that makes things easy!\" Yuma said, keeping up her faux‐childish demeanor. \"If you\'re willing to do *that*, then the only thing we have to discuss are the terms of this \'deal\' you want to make.\"

\"We have a lot more to discuss than that,\" Simona said, shading her eyes. \"But not, I think, until after the examination. Before I talk about the deal, may I ask how I can expect the examination to, uh, feel*? I am actually as young as I look, so I\'m not as hardened as the likes of you two.\"

Yuma traded glances with Sayaka, who she could tell was feeling sympathetic despite herself. There was a certain... melancholic air about the girl that couldn\'t be denied.

\"It will be perfectly fine, possibly even a little pleasant, as long as you don\'t actually resist,\" Yuma said, sitting up as well. \"That\'s not a threat, just a statement of fact. If you prefer, it can be done while you\'re unconscious, but I personally wouldn\'t recommend it.\"

Simona nodded, looking reassured after the moment of vulnerability. Yuma had to remind herself that it could all be an act---though if the girl was willing to undergo having her soul gem thoroughly investigated by a soul mage, it would have been surprising if she were lying. Any lies would be uncovered soon enough.

\"So?\" Yuma asked, leaning back on the couch. \"The deal?\"

\"It\'s a very simple one, ultimately,\" Simona said. \"We are aware that some of Humanity\'s best physicists are currently working with my friend Shizuki Ryouko on the project of making a temporary, small wormhole.\"

Sayaka nodded, and Yuma gestured for her to continue.

\"They are very close, but there\'s a number of ways the experiments might go very wrong, given the amount of indirect energy they will be trying to handle. We have information about the refinements necessary to make sure that *doesn\'t* happen. Obviously, this is a project with substantial importance to the war effort, so we expect it will be valuable to you.\"

\"And in return?\" Yuma asked.

Simona clasped her hands, taking a breath.

\"Eventually, we think you are likely to use what you learn to have Ryouko and her... friend open passages for attacking bases in the Ceph rear. When that happens, I\'d like to join them.\"

Yuma blinked, tasking part of herself with retrieving all she recalled about Simona and Ryouko. If she remembered correctly, Mami had told her certain things about what Simona thought of Ryouko.

\"Join them?\" Sayaka asked, with audible air quotes around \"join\".

\"If Ryouko goes on any missions associated with this, I\'d like to be on the team,\" Simona said. \"If she\'s making a wormhole, I\'d like to be around. You can assign me a minder, imprison me afterward, it doesn\'t matter. But that\'s the condition.\"

\"That\'s quite a condition,\" Yuma said. \"What exactly is it that you intend to do there? And why?\"

\"Protect her, naturally,\" Simona said. \"As well as some observation. Once you review my memories, you\'ll see I have no intention of harming her. Rather the opposite, in fact. I\'m not unbiased.\"

Yuma frowned, putting a hand to her chin.

It would be at least a small leap of faith, even if everything in Simona\'s memories validated what she said. Soul gem examination was foolproof, in the sense that you could be definitely sure the magical girl in question believed everything you were seeing. In fact, it was better than that: it could bypass even Reformatting, accessing what the girl *really* remembered---even if it was colored with all the usual vagaries of memory. You could detect mind control, hidden traumatic triggers, all kinds of things, even more reliably than you could on a normal human.

But that didn\'t mean it was immune to all possible schemes. The schemes just had to involve a lack of knowledge on Simona\'s part.

Which meant certain precautions had to be taken. If there was hidden gambit here, it almost certainly didn\'t involve the nature of Simona\'s request: they could strip her of any and all equipment, scan her inside and out and, after the examination, be certain she *meant* it if she said she intended to protect Ryouko. They wouldn\'t even need a minder, except maybe to keep a supposedly freshly‐contracted girl with no combat experience from getting in the way.

No... if this was a trick, it was either in how it changed their behavior or the information they were receiving in exchange. But what did they have Humanity‐class physicists for if they couldn\'t smell a rat?

But still, even if she couldn\'t think of a malicious angle, that didn\'t mean there wasn\'t one.

She filed the problem away to another part of herself to ruminate over. She might submit it to an AI analyzer later for probability modeling, but not yet.

\"Alright, tentatively, yes,\" Yuma said. \"I\'m okay with the idea, but I\'d like to see these memories of yours before deciding for sure.\"

\"That\'s only fair,\" Simona said.

\"Don\'t get me wrong, I\'ve reneged on deals before,\" Yuma said. "Though not without what I hope is good reason. But I\'d guess that in some way this is, perhaps, more the opening steps of a negotiation, more than just a single deal?\"

Simona shook her head, before pausing to watch a raven that had flown in through the balcony and was pecking at the floor.

\"That\'d be my guess,\" she said. \"But I don\'t really know. I\'ve been kept out of the loop on some things. That\'s why I was sent. Plus, once you see my wish you\'ll understand why it was also a bit of a favor to me.\"

\"What exactly does a secret organization that has managed to stay off of everyone\'s radar hope to accomplish?\"

Simona was silent for a moment, clearly mulling over what to say, then just watching as Sayaka stretched her hand out casually, the raven jumping onto it. Sayaka pet it with her other hand, and Yuma wasn\'t sure she even realized what she was doing.

Simona closed her eyes for a long moment.

\"We\'re saving the world, of course.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I can\'t get over how weird it feels to be out here like this,\" Marianne said, ducking self‐consciously behind her old‐fashioned printed menu, pretending to study it intently.

There wasn\'t really that much to think about, in Mami\'s opinion. After all, everything here appeared to be some brow‐furrowing patchwork of Indian and Eastern‐European food. Mami considered herself more experienced than her contemporaries with international cuisine, but even she had difficulty parsing the intricacies of curry‐filled khachapuri, and what kind of cheese went well with her choice. One might as well choose at random and trust the chef knew what they were doing.

Or in her case, allow Machina to choose whatever caught her fancy. She seemed to have taken after Mami in her love of food, another mildly disturbing data point on a broader tableau she tried not to think about.

\"You\'re not undercover here, Marianne,\" Mami said. \"This is a vacation. You *do* officially work for me. And you know, it\'s good to be seen together in public every once in a while. Besides, doesn\'t Odette let you take some trips from time to time?\"

\"More like she makes me take them,\" Marianne said, more a grumble than a statement.

Mami let the topic go at that. She wasn\'t really in a position to berate Marianne, having personally set the example the other woman was following. The truth was, she didn\'t really know any better than her how to do this. The idea was that she was going to take a long break to collect herself back together and... do what exactly?

She couldn\'t remember the last time she had taken a real break, which she supposed was part of the problem.

*Before my time,* Machina commented. *But I can estimate based on your previous memories.*

*Forget it, it was rhetorical,* Mami thought.

Mami had started to acclimate to the voice in her head, but couldn\'t deny that it bothered her. Mentally, it felt like being naked and not being able to put your clothes back on, in front of a younger version of herself. In principle you knew they were your friend and would never judge, but it made her feel vulnerable.

But, runaway analogies aside, she had to admit it was actually rather nice to have a friend to always talk to. There had been points in her life where something like that would have been everything in the world to her.

She sighed, wishing she had some tea to drink.

Ordinarily, she would have buried herself in something she enjoyed doing---cooking or baking, or holding tea parties---but this felt like it demanded a little more than that, so she had reached out a little, did some planning.

Okay, so she hadn\'t *quite* gone on full vacation. Instead, she was going on an informal inspection tour of the colonies, a nice low‐key PR trip that was so unadvertised the colonies themselves were surprised when she showed up. That way she avoided having to go on official leave.

The server appeared a moment later, showing Mami a local wine that claimed to be a variant of Rioja. She was skeptical, but it was supposed to be a good pairing with the dish she was getting. A *good pairing*. Of wine with curry khachapuri. Or Khachakurri, also the name of the restaurant they were sitting in.

*Good Goddess, just what is going on out here in the colonies?* she thought, not for the first time this trip. She wasn\'t a fan of that particular neologism, but she felt better about it now that she had met the potential origin of the term.

*Come on, it might be fun,* Machina insisted softly at the corners of her mind. *You shouldn\'t be so cynical.*

Mami could only do the mental equivalent of smiling vaguely. It was no use hiding her real feelings.

Mami... still didn\'t know what to *do* about Machina, other than shoot off a raftful of angry messages to everyone involved in the TacComp project, messages that Machina\'s very presence made awkward to write. The sheer *scale* of the screw‐up that must have occurred boggled her mind.

She realized that a part of her didn\'t mind at all having someone much younger she could take places and experience new things with. It felt like living things all over again, injecting new life into tattered experiences, and stripping off the layers of cynicism that ensured she would never be disappointed by something as ridiculous as the fusion of Indian spice‐based cuisine and a preparation from Eastern Europe.

She took a deep breath, knowing full well Machina could probably hear all of those thoughts. She needed to think about *something else*.

She tried to focus on the here and now, on Marianne frowning at the menu behind a honed telepathic shield that seemed to scratch at the edges of Mami\'s mind, now that she knew once again what to do with such things.

It would be rude to pry, so she looked around at the restaurant\'s décor, the kind of open, vaguely archaic design that seemed to be fashionable on this colony. New California... wouldn\'t have been her first choice for a visit, but they had other reasons for being here. She supposed she just couldn\'t resist mixing a little work with her fun.

What sounded like a scuffle at the doorway of the restaurant gave Mami something to look at, even as she honed her hearing to listen in.

\"Sir, we have strict instructions. No media,\" someone\'s voice said, probably a maître d\'.

\"I\'m not media!\" a man\'s voice insisted.

\"Like hell you\'re not! I didn\'t get this old to not be able to spot you types a mile away.\"

*That* was Kyouko, and Mami couldn\'t help but smile as she watched her push her way past other customers in line to enter the restaurant, too impatient or too aggravated by the people trying to follow her to wait to be pointed in.

\"Honestly, going places with you is such a pain sometimes,\" Kyouko said, walking up to them. \"The last thing any of us needs is a swarm of reporters. At least your bodyguards are nice.\"

\"It can\'t be helped,\" Mami said, suddenly in a cheerful mood. \"This is unfortunately a public visit, so I can\'t hide who I am. And I see you brought a friend?\"

Kyouko averted her eyes slightly before snapping them back, so quickly that most people would have missed it---but not Mami, who had to suppress a smile. This was a side of Kyouko she hadn\'t seen since, well, the beginning.

\"Maki is a friend,\" Kyouko said, a bit stiff, switching to Standard in deference to Marianne, and also, Mami suspected, because she didn\'t want to have to decide which honorific to use, or whether to use "Kishida\" instead. Japanese could be too revealing a language sometimes.

Maki sat down politely, without introducing herself, in the modern style that Mami still couldn\'t avoid feeling was *wrong*. Sure, everyone had nomenclators, but...

Marianne raised an eyebrow minutely, probably not even aware she was doing it. Mami didn\'t need telepathy to read her mind: she was aware of Kyouko\'s reputation and found it rude that Kyouko was bringing a fling unannounced to their arranged meeting.

\"Good afternoon,\" Maki said.

The girl seemed embarrassed, yet defiant. She probably thought she was intruding.

*Kyouko should have told me she was bringing company,* Mami thought to herself. *But maybe it was unplanned, and she\'s never been that good with the niceties...*

Kyouko made a slight grunt that suggested she had started reading the menu. She still wasn\'t exactly a connoisseur, but had developed just enough refinement to consider poorly‐made food analogous to *wasting food, a sore point even in this age of plenty.

Mami needed to save the situation somehow, while also resisting the temptation of reading the minds of everyone in the area.

\"How are you two doing?\" Mami asked, deciding that it was best to attack the problem point‐blank, even if it embarrassed Kyouko. \"Did you do anything for Maki\'s birthday? I recommended that restaurant, but you never replied...\"

She smiled disarmingly, taking a careful sip of her wine, which was better than she expected. Kyouko gave her a look full of murder, while Maki unexpectedly hid her face behind her menu.

\"Was it the ramen place?\" Marianne asked, picking up the social cue perfectly once she realized her mistake. \"I know you love that place. It\'s so hard to find places that use real eggs nowadays, given the controversy.\"

\"No, we went to a bed and breakfast,\" Maki said, in a slightly squeaky voice. \"On top of one of the skyscrapers. I always thought Kyouko had her own luxury place somewhere, but apparently not.\"

*Whoops,* Mami thought, politely avoiding looking at either of them.

*Anyway,* she thought, this time broadcasting to Kyouko and Marianne. While you decide your orders, let\'s talk about the serious agenda for this meeting. Kyouko, do you think Maki should be in on this? I don\'t want to make you feel bad, but it might actually be an issue that she\'s here.*

Again, a glimmer of discomfort passed across Kyouko\'s face, invisible to most observers who weren\'t Ancients and old friends.

*I* know, she thought. *But once she heard I was traveling she wouldn\'t let me go alone. I mean---look, I have stuff I need to take care of, I\'m not trying to shut you out. I just have business. I don\'t think she trusts me.*

Mami was forced to suppress a laugh, converting it into an inelegant cough that embarrassed her.

\"Sorry, I must have gotten something in my throat. All these implants, you\'d think we could take care of something like that,\" she explained out loud.

*I take it we should work around her then?* Mami asked.

*Yes, because we don\'t know what we\'re going to find,* Kyouko thought. It could be fine, or it could be dark shit. Look, don\'t worry---if it becomes too much of a problem, Maki and I can just go to a resort or something. It\'s not like I* have *to be involved.*

Kyouko paused, making sure no one else interrupted her rhetorical pause by emanating a telepathic perception of thoughtfulness.

*Are you sure you\'re alright, Mami?* she thought. *I thought you were supposed to be on vacation.* This *is a vacation?*

*What else could it be? A chance to meet with old friends, eat, and explore the world together. That it happens to involve something slightly important is just being efficient.*

*I suppose,* Kyouko thought.

In truth, Mami wasn\'t really as sure as that, but what exactly was she supposed to do? Mope around about a girl who\'d been dead for centuries? She missed Akari, but the many years of unrelated memories blurred the situation and took out some of the sting, just as it was supposed to. She had already cried about it, privately, but the hole in her life that was supposed to be there, the emptiness of a spot unfilled, had been sealed shut by something else long ago. There was little else to do but to try to carry on her legacy.

And yet... she couldn\'t help but think that she had lost something in the process. Even the lows of life were still part of life.

*What was it Clarisse once said?* Machina thought. *Being magical girls deprives us of the ability to be truly sad, because then we just die instead.*

*Something like that,* Mami responded, unhappy with the idea.

Searching for something else to pay attention to, Mami caught the eye of Kyouko\'s love interest. She\'d be lying if she said either she or Yuma were thrilled with Kyouko\'s choice of partners, but she had seen enough over the years to share the MHD\'s opinion on the matter. First, do no harm.

And at least the girl seemed to have a good head on her shoulders, since the look she was giving Mami suggested she knew quite well they were talking behind her back. Mami wondered at her real reasons for insisting on coming with Kyouko.

She was given a brief respite from the social interactions by the arrival of her food, which came with a side presentation of local "strongly‐flavored\" salad. She couldn\'t spot anything like that about the assortment of colorful leaves, though.

*Look, I can understand the motivation for wanting to do something yourself,* Kyouko thought, artfully transmitting the thought even as she spoke an order to the waiter. *But in this case I\'m not sure we\'d do anything other than get in the way. Something happened to Misa Virani on this planet all those years ago, something that may have been erased from her memory. That\'s nice and spooky, but there\'s not really anything we can do here that Marianne and the other investigators couldn\'t do without us.*

Mami reached down for a fork, pondering how to respond to Kyouko\'s question. She hadn\'t asked Mami anything when she received the invitation, since it had been phrased mostly as a vacation invite, but the question was valid.

*You\'re right, of course,* she thought. *And really, this is still mostly a bit of a lark, but one that makes at least some sense. I talked with Kuroi Kana, and it seems the Far Seers are very interested in finding out what happened here. Interested enough that they\'re setting up a séance including Kana herself. After all, the more Ancients get involved in one of these things, the better they tend to work.*

*You called me here for that?* Kyouko thought incredulously. *They might be right sometimes, but I\'d take a Ribbon vision over that claptrap every day of the week, and twice on Sundays. At least when the Goddess makes you spend a year guessing at the meaning there\'s always a good reason for it.*

*Yes, well---*

Mami stopped, only *just* managing to avoid coughing on her salad. They hadn\'t been kidding about the strong flavor, which was apparently released only when you broke the epidermis of the leaf.

*Anyway,* she continued, ignoring Kyouko\'s smirk. *It can\'t possibly hurt, and they\'ve come through for us before... sometimes. Hey, it\'s a vacation, right? For you too. Why not spend it meditating with your old senpai?*

*Now I* know *you\'ve got your memories back,* Kyouko thought. *Geez. Rather than meditating, we\'re probably going to end up high as a kite on psychedelic drugs. I\'ve heard the rumors about what they do sometimes, don\'t think I haven\'t.*

Kyouko slurped loudly, working on the noodle concoction that she had ordered. Marianne gave her a look. Earth\'s cultures still hadn\'t reached a consensus on whether noodle‐slurping was polite or impolite.

*There\'s a reason they\'re called rumors, Kyouko. I\'m sure this event will be perfectly respectable.*

*Right. I\'ve heard* that *one before.*

Mami bit back a whole phalanx of pithy retorts. Best not to embarrass Kyouko in front of Maki.

*I still can\'t believe I got pulled into this,* Marianne thought.

Mami shrugged and took a bite of her food.

*Oh, that\'s really quite good,* Machina commented.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Now put your soul gems into the fire,\" the séance leader, a certain Roshni Desai, said. She smiled broadly at the assembled mages, which included Kyouko and Mami, Marianne, the promised Kuroi Kana, the MHD specialist Atsuko Arisu, and Nadya Antipova---not a usual invite, but she *had* been one of Misa\'s team members. Clarisse van Rossum was unavailable, busy elsewhere for her usual historical reasons.

They sat cross‐legged on rugs around the central fire, in a room rented from a local cultural association. The location and accoutrements were determined, apparently, by whatever seemed most likely to synergize with the person and locale being investigated. Since the subject was the past actions of Misa Virani on a planet with a high Indian population, that meant they were surrounded by Indian decorations and Roshni was leading the ceremony.

Mami couldn\'t help but feel a ripple of unease, even as the other Seers followed Roshni\'s instruction with hardly a murmur. It was the kind of thing that triggered an almost instinctual terror in one such as her. Even if the fire was a \"sacred\" fire, lit by the magic of the séance leader. Even if.

Mami summoned her soul gem and placed it carefully amid the flames as instructed, noting that for the moment they had somehow stopped burning hot.

\"I have to say, I have some reser---ow!\" Kyouko began, interrupted by an elbow from Kana.

Mami had to smile at Kyouko\'s annoyed expression.

\"Rest assured, Roshni is not here to kill anyone,\" another Seer said. "And, in case someone else tries, well, that\'s why we have guards at the doors, isn\'t it?\"

\"Right,\" Kyouko said, still skeptical.

\"Let us begin, then,\" Roshni said, taking a seat herself. \"Close your eyes, and I will attune the fire. After that, we will see.\"

*Stop rolling your eyes, Kyouko,* she rebuked. *You wouldn\'t want people rolling their eyes about your Ribbon, would you?*

Kyouko sent back an annoyed sensation.

Mami closed her eyes as instructed, and settled in.

Something...

Something was---

*---BURNING---*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Ah!\" she started to scream, lurching awake---or seemingly awake, anyway---almost falling off her feet.

It took a moment for her to get her bearings. She wasn\'t sure what she was doing, standing in the middle of a busy, colonial street market. Or, now that she looked, why her skin was an interesting shade of brown.

\"Well, this is definitely new,\" a strange voice said next to her.

Mami started to nod, before jerking around violently toward the source of the voice.

\"Ow, ow, Mami, you\'re dragging me!\"

Mami let go of the girl\'s hand, unable to stop herself from bending over and staring at the smaller girl, who looked to be about ten. Like her, she was brown‐skinned, but the general cast of features was, somehow, unmistakable, despite the discrepant voice.

\"Oh God... dess,\" Mami said. \"What are you doing here?\"

\"This appears to be some kind of magically‐induced soul gem vision from the séance,\" Machina said, putting her hands on her waist and looking around at the bustling market around them. \"As for why I\'m here, why we\'re* here, and what exactly we\'re supposed to be doing, I have no idea.\"

The girl was grinning broadly, an expression that gave Mami an odd feeling in her heart. She tried to recall: Had she ever been like that?

Machina didn\'t answer this one, but Mami worked it out herself: Maybe. It was impossible to tell what she would have been like if her parents had never died, and she had difficulty remembering the time before that.

Mami shook her head vigorously, trying to clear it. Before very recently, she would have said that visions were a rare thing for her. Now, fresh on the heels of a vision from Kyouko\'s supposed Goddess and the revelation of her own Reformatting, she was exploring a street market with an avatar of her tactical computer clone, by way of magical séance. How things changed.

It seemed now as if there had always been a whole layer of reality waiting for her, just out of reach.

\"Come on, let\'s go explore a bit,\" Machina said, grabbing Mami\'s hand. \"I think the vision made us mother and daughter. I can\'t imagine why. If anything, it should be the other way around.\"

Unsure how to respond, Mami settled for nodding vaguely, finally taking a look around the market. It had a dream‐like quality, the details fading away in the distance, into a fog that smeared color and image into an impressionist tableau.

Even as Machina tugged at her hand, the girl likewise looked around in fascination. Mami realized that it must have been very novel for her to see things with her own eyes.

One thing was evident. This *was* a modern colonial market, the vendors standing unflappably in scorching heat as small robots waved insects away from food, or scurried along the edges of tables, or perched watching on the edge of tent flaps.

Machina started to pull her forward, and Mami followed gamely. After all, with no other clues they might as well just start walking.

The vendors greeted them as they passed, treating her as if she were a regular, though every time they used her name it sounded tinny, as if it were being sent through an archaic sound system with bad quality. Maaa---mi. Somehow she doubted that\'s what they were really saying.

\"Hey look, roti!\" Machina pointed, tugging at Mami\'s hand. \"Can we get some?\"

Before Mami had a chance to respond, Machina grabbed one off the stack, rolled it up, and began eating it, exchanging only the briefest of greetings with the vendor. She was obviously enjoying this, somehow.

They continued together until the stalls began to thin out. Then, abruptly, Mami felt her legs moving of their own accord, turning away from the main walkway, past a Goan sausage stand, and up to an inconspicuous doorway where a hooded woman reclined against the wall.

\"It took you long enough,\" the voice---Homura\'s voice---said.

\"I got here on time,\" Mami heard herself saying, even as she quickly bobbed her head downward to look under the hood. Yes, that really *was Homura, a twenty‐five‐year‐old version of her, at least.

\"Let\'s get inside,\" Homura said.

*This doesn\'t make sense,* Machina thought, as they followed Homura into the doorway. *I thought this was some kind of reading of the past, but* Akemi‐san? *If she had ever really been here wearing a silly hood, she would have triggered every surveillance system on the planet.*

*Before she left us, she never visited* this *planet,* Mami thought. Maybe this isn\'t the past after all.*

*I don\'t like how surreal this is.*

*I can\'t say I disagree.*

They stepped into a small flat and were immediately hit by the intoxicating scent of roasting spices and meat. Tandoori chicken, unless Mami missed her guess.

They sat where Homura indicated, and watched as a man---whose face was smeared out---brought them chicken. Mami\'s eyes tracked its arrival, and she realized she looked hungry enough as to be unseemly. Why?

\"Wow, what\'s the occasion?\" she heard herself saying.

\"That we traveled all the way to be here,\" Homura said, taking a seat at the table. \"Might as well.\"

\"Your connections are everywhere,\" Machina said, though Mami suspected the comment was part of the vision.

\"I\'ve been building them for a while, of course,\" Homura said. \"I\'m sure that doesn\'t surprise you. But that\'s getting off‐track. Eat a little, and then we\'ll talk about why we\'re on this planet.\"

Mami did as suggested, tearing into the meat with a gusto that reminded her of Kyouko. The meat was delicious, and the meal went by so quickly she wondered if any time had passed at all---probably not.

\"Interesting body, by the way,\" Machina commented to Homura. \"Your usual one not good enough?\"

\"My main is supposed to be on Earth right now,\" Homura said, shrugging. \"So I had to be someone else to be here without raising suspicion.\"

Mami furrowed her brow. Body? In the vision she was very obviously Homura, but if in reality she had been inhabiting other... bodies...

That would neatly explain why they had never been able to find her, she realized. But this *was* just a vision, of course, and one that was taking serious liberties with appearances. She also didn\'t detect any soul gem signature.

\"So what\'s the deal, *Nabee*?\" her character asked. \"It wasn\'t easy getting on such a crowded planet unnoticed. Earth is one thing, since we have established ways, but---\"

Homura held up a hand, requesting silence.

\"We\'ve found another testing facility,\" she said. \"On this planet. That\'s why we\'re here.\"

\"It can\'t be,\" Machina said. \"Here? On‐world? That\'s audacious.\"

\"Well, it\'s not like it\'s right in the middle of the city,\" Homura said. \"But it does suggest something. Logistical problems. They may not have all the power we think they have.\"

\"Well, then, what\'s the plan?\" Mami said.

\"The plan is the same as always. We shut it down.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Kyouko opened her eyes again, she found herself on the sidewalk of a crowded colonial street. People pushed past her in flowing, colorful garments, the chaos of the walkway a stark contrast to the eerie, efficient flow of automated traffic control.

There was no mystery as to where she was: this was New California. She had seen a similar scene herself only recently, while she was traveling to meet Mami. The question was why she was here.

\"I didn\'t expect to see you here,\" someone next to her said, in Standard. \"You *are* the real Sakura Kyouko, right?\"

\"Yeah, that\'d be me,\" Kyouko said---and resisted the urge to move her hands to her mouth in shock. *That* was her voice? Standard was a blunt, straightforward language---probably why she liked it---but the high‐pitched lilt she had just spoken with ruined the effect entirely.

Kyouko turned towards the other girl, but her eyes seemed to focus poorly, giving her a blurred image she didn\'t recognize. Hispanic...?

Then she felt the magical signature.

\"Nadya?\" she asked. \"Is that you?\"

\"Yes, *Miss Sakura.* You do realize you don\'t look normal either?\"

Kyouko blinked, then raised her hand, which looked both larger and differently colored than she expected. Her body felt different, too.

\"I guess we\'re both someone else right now,\" she said. \"That\'s a bit unusual, but then again, these are always weird. I mean, I\'ve never had one with someone else involved, either.\"

She looked out over the roadway as she spoke, trying to see if she could spot anything useful.

\"I haven\'t had one of \'these\' at all, assuming you\'re talking about visions,\" Nadya said, mimicking Kyouko\'s action.

Kyouko suppressed the temptation to evangelize the Church, instead focusing on her search of the environment.

Frankly, she was impressed that this \"séance\" had worked. She had sat in on a few in her time, but never experienced anything particularly interesting. This one, though, resembled a Ribbon vision in clarity. She wondered how the magic of the assembled mages combined to make this, and whether it really worked the way they thought it did.

Finally she turned and looked at Nadya, the other girl raising an eyebrow at her.

\"We might as well take a walk,\" she said. \"For all we know the Far Seers\' clairvoyance just dumped us on the street outside, or something like that. Can\'t hurt.\"

Nadya shrugged, allowing Kyouko to lead her into the crowd. As they walked, she looked around at the enticingly exuberant storefronts, filled with merchandise and signs that urgently pleaded with passerby to buy, buy, buy.

\"It\'s so busy here,\" Kyouko said, ignoring the angry looks of pedestrians as she barreled past them. \"You don\'t see this kind of thing on Earth, and we have more people.\"

\"There\'s more infrastructure on Earth,\" Nadya said. \"Haven\'t you been on the colonies?\"

\"Not as much as I\'d like,\" Kyouko said. \"I\'ve never been one to stay in one place for long, but the MSY work makes it hard to leave Earth unless it\'s on business. It\'s a lot easier now, with the Church. I should have had that idea a long time ago.\"

She thought, not for the first time, about Mami\'s idea before the war, that they take an extended vacation. In retrospect she had been totally right.

Kyouko stopped, looking up at a sign that caught her eye.

\"What is it?\" Nadya asked.

\"Local sweets shop,\" Kyouko said, gesturing at a store advertising "Indian desserts\". \"Might as well grab a treat. To be honest, Indian desserts have always been a bit too sweet for me. Not to talk shit about someone else\'s culture---it\'s definitely on my end.\"

\"Too sweet? For Sakura Kyouko?\" Nadya said dryly. Something about her new accent made it sound *particularly* sharp.

\"Hey, that\'s rude---\" Kyouko said, feeling at her clothes instinctively for some of the food she was usually carrying around.

She stopped when she found something bulging in her pocket.

Nadya leaned over to look as Kyouko unwrapped what appeared to be a piece of paper.

> I\'ll meet you at Café Arabica. Misa

\"Not exactly a wordy message,\" Nadya said.

\"Yeah, but *paper,*\" Kyouko said. \"No one does that anymore, unless they\'re trying to avoid being noticed. And why do *I* have a message from her?\"

She stood in place for a moment, wondering if she should still try to get some food, before shrugging.

\"I guess we got our notification, but how exactly do we get to---\"

Nadya poked her in the shoulder, pointing at a vehicle that had stopped at the curb.

Kyouko snorted, casting a skeptical eye at the transport, which was a bit less high‐class than she was used to.

\"I guess that answers that. So we *are* being pointed somewhere.\"

\"Is it always like this?\" Nadya asked, as they ducked their heads to step inside.

\"What? With the Goddess?\" Kyouko asked. \"Only sometimes. She likes to mix things up. You just go along for the ride.\"

She chose not to comment that asking her about her visions was tantamount to conceding Ribbon visions were real. Another time.

She spent a quiet few minutes watching the city---town, really, by Earth standards---whiz by her window, details hazy, like an old romantic painting. She started to wonder how long the ride would be, feeling abruptly tired. If she just closed her eyes for a moment...

\"This isn\'t just a vacation, is it?\" Kyouko asked, snapping awake even as she spoke the words.

\"No, it isn\'t,\" Misa Virani said, seated across from her. \"It\'s about finding answers.\"

Kyouko\'s eyes widened, and she twisted her head around to look at her surroundings. She found herself seated with Misa and \"Nadya\" at a three‐person table placed on the rear balcony of a café. They were seated at the edge of the balcony, next to a permasteel railing that was all that separated them from a sheer drop. Looking down, she could see a heart‐stopping rock cliff, massively tall, with the ground below shrouded in mist.

In front of them was laid out the temperate wilderness of the planet. She had heard that the city they were in was set on top of a large mesa, and apparently this café was perched right over the edge, but this was ridiculous. She\'d have to pay a visit later with Maki, and maybe Mami, before they left the planet.

With an effort, she tore her eyes away from the view, focusing on the scene in front of her. On the table were three identical cups of coffee and date‐filled pastries, as yet untouched.

Picking up the pastry, she looked at Misa, and saw that the girl was clutching a necklace in one hand, though Kyouko could see only the chain and part of the centerpiece. Her hair moved uneasily behind her, coiling back and forth in a way Kyouko had to confess unsettled her.

\"I don\'t believe the official account,\" Misa said. \"There\'s no way she should have died. She still had power. Instead, she died on the transport ship. I don\'t believe it.\"

\"If you don\'t believe it, what makes you think you\'ll find anything here rather than on the ship?\" Kyouko heard herself saying, as Nadya shook her head with obvious sadness.

She took a bite of the pastry, which was as good as she had hoped, the filling sweet and crumbly.

It also gave her time to think. She was hearing herself speak as if she were part of this conversation with Misa, despite having no idea why she was here. She hadn\'t felt her mouth move, or any kind of mind‐control magic. It had just... happened.

It seemed the vision had assigned them roles to play in a historical tableau. Maybe they were filling in for real people who had been involved; maybe it was just a construct of the vision.

*So she was after one of the missing girls,* Kyouko thought. *All those years ago. And now she\'s missing too. This pisses me off.*

\"There\'s no real reason to think I\'ll find much, if I\'m honest. Blind hope, mostly,\" Misa said, cupping her coffee with two hair tendrils. \"I just feel like I should be doing *something*. And, like I said, I don\'t believe the official account. If something else happened to her, I\'d just like some closure. Or someone to be angry at, at least.\"

She looked piteous, and Kyouko couldn\'t help but feel a twinge in her heart. She knew what it was like.

\"So how do you plan on looking for anything?\" Kyouko found herself asking. \"You\'re not exactly a clairvoyant or a detective, and you\'re supposed to be here on vacation. Are you just going to ask around?\"

Misa smiled slightly.

\"I\'m not without my tricks. Every magical girl beyond a certain age has a few skills they keep off the official radar. And haven\'t you been wondering about my friend here?\"

She gestured at Nadya, whom Kyouko looked at questioningly.

Nadya simply returned the look, shrugging slightly. She didn\'t know what Misa was talking about either.

*May as well let this vision do its piece,* Nadya thought.

\"And what about your friend here, then?\" Kyouko asked after a pause. "Is she some kind of clairvoyant? I wasn\'t exactly expecting someone to meet me at the starport.\"

\"I like to keep things discreet,\" Nadya said, smiling slightly.

She took a sip of her coffee, before withdrawing the smile.

\"Well, I specialize in tracking people,\" she continued. \"Technically it\'s not... what I do, but my power does make me good at it, so I run a private eye service on the side for people who need it. *Pro bono*, not like I need the money.\"

\"She and I go way back,\" Misa said, looking down at her drink. \"I just never thought I\'d need to be a client.\"

\"No one ever thinks that,\" Nadya said, patting Misa on the hand. \"But we\'ll find out what happened to her, don\'t you worry. Between the two of us there\'s nothing we can\'t do!\"

Kyouko nodded.

\"Then what are we waiting for?\" she asked. \"You asked me out here to do this, then let\'s do it, and see what we find.\"

Misa nodded, opening the palm of her hand to reveal the necklace Kyouko had spotted earlier. It was a simple‐looking charm, blue crystal formed into the shape of a crescent moon, slightly iridescent. It bore an uncomfortable resemblance to a soul gem she had seen once, but that was probably a coincidence.

\"It was hers,\" Misa said.

\"Can you give me a little history or description of what it was, what it meant?\" Nadya asked. \"I know it\'s a little personal, but it will help me.\"

\"It was a keepsake from her parents,\" Misa said, sighing. \"She asked me to keep it for her, before her last assignment. She obviously thought she might not be coming back. I was her team leader once, a long time ago. I mentored her.\"

\"Can you give me some idea where she might have been on this planet?\" Nadya asked. \"It would help the tracking a lot to know somewhere, anywhere that she\'s been.\"

\"I can help with that,\" Misa said. \"Kind of. You\'d be surprised how many systems on both sides of this war still use some form of electricity. Anyway, the transport ship carrying her soul gem docked at the military starport in this city just after her soul gem was lost. The only thing it did after that was get destroyed by a squid raid on its way back. If there\'s anything anywhere, it\'s at the military starport.\"

Nadya sighed.

\"Well, a starport is a particularly difficult place to track anyone, given the number of people involved. But I\'ve done it before, so let\'s find out.\"

\"Let\'s go, then,\" Kyouko said. \"Well, maybe after we all finish our food.\"

They sat there in silence for a moment, Kyouko blowing through the remains of her meal, then watching the others eat.

Just as she was starting to get worried that the vision would insist they all get on a transport and head for the starport, her surroundings started to blur, and the séance room came back into her perception for a moment.

Unable to resist, she cracked open an eye and saw the fire glowing a kaleidoscope of colors over their soul gems. The colors seemed to pull her in...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"So she\'s definitely been here, and moreover she was alive when it happened, but she wasn\'t conscious at the time,\" Nadya said when Kyouko opened her eyes again. \"However, I can sense who was moving her, and try to follow them instead.\"

\"Do you know who they were?\" Misa asked. \"Do you know what they were doing?\"

\"No, that\'s not something I do,\" Nadya said. \"But let\'s see what happens when we follow this line.\"

*If she already knew this much, why didn\'t she just ask for help? I\'m sure the Soul Guard could have helped if she explained all this,* Kyouko thought.

*I don\'t know,* Nadya thought. *But she was always headstrong. Maybe she wanted to see for herself, or she just didn\'t want to lose time.*

*Or she probably did ask, earlier, and no one believed her,* Kyouko speculated. *Hard for her to want to ask again, even if she had more evidence.*

*Maybe,* Nadya thought.

*It burns me up to think that after all we\'ve been through, one of our vets didn\'t want to ask for help. What\'s the point of all this if we\'ve got girls like her trying to play detective on their own?* Kyouko thought, making sure a piece of her frustration carried through.

Nadya sent back the telepathic equivalent of a shrug, and Kyouko shook her head. She was too young to understand.

*I know you\'re involved in this somehow,* she thought privately. *This looks too much like one of yours. But why did you wait so long?*

Her Goddess did not answer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami found herself standing in the hallway of what appeared to be... a hospital? A laboratory? She couldn\'t quite tell, because the walls and doorways looked faded and lacking in detail.

*They\'ve cleared out,* \"Homura\" thought, apparently from elsewhere in the building.

*And apparently in quite a hurry,* Mami---or rather, the character in her vision---responded. *They left everything here.*

Everyone, *you mean,* Homura replied. *I\'m just glad we made it here in time. I\'d bet you all the files are wiped, though.*

*Of course,* Mami replied.

As she spoke, she swung her head around to get a better look at her surroundings. Homura had clearly referenced *people* with her line, but Mami couldn\'t see anyone. Just empty, stripped‐down hallways and the vague silhouettes of equipment.

She was reminded of what the Far Seers had always whispered about their visions: that they had a mind of their own, revealing or withholding information for often inscrutable reasons.

\"Inscrutable, my ass, is what Kyouko would say,\" Machina said, putting her hands on her hips. \"Not this time.\"

Mami looked down, then nodded in agreement. She\'d been around the block long enough to know when information was being deliberately held back. And unlike all those years ago with Akari, this time she had an idea who was doing the holding back.

She stood there, staring down the hallway for a long moment, waiting for something to happen, for her character to start walking into one of the rooms. When nothing happened she turned and looked the other way, Machina following her lead.

\"Hold it right there,\" a voice said behind her. \"Keep your hands where I can see them. Transform and I drop you.\"

Mami felt herself raising her hands, and couldn\'t help but feel a little nervous. Visions couldn\'t hurt you, right?

*Mami? What the hell are you doing here?* Kyouko thought, apparently somewhere behind her. Kyouko\'s and Nadya\'s magical signatures had appeared abruptly in her awareness, along with a girl she couldn\'t identify.

*You tell me!* Mami complained. *I just got here.*

She thought about explaining that Machina was here too, but decided it would be too weird. If Kyouko didn\'t ask...

\"Turn around, slowly,\" the mystery girl said.

*It\'s Misa Virani,* Machina thought. *You\'ve heard her voice before, though I\'m not surprised you didn\'t recognize it right away.*

Mami felt herself following the instruction, turning so that the other girls came gradually into view. The three of them stood fully transformed, with Misa in the center. The two girls next to her, apparently Kyouko and Nadya in this vision, held vaguely threatening postures, but Misa clearly meant business, floating ever‐so‐slightly off the ground with hand pointed forward. Her hair flared outward and upward, crackling slightly.

*She\'s angry,* Mami assessed automatically. *But she\'s holding it back, or she could have disabled me---whoever this is---easily, given how surprised I am.*

She risked a glance at Machina, who was also standing with her arms vaguely raised.

As a rule, it just wasn\'t safe to hold an unknown magical girl at figurative gunpoint, whatever your powers or backup. You just didn\'t know what they were capable of. If you were going to try, like Misa was trying, it was only logical to keep yourself fully charged, so to speak.

\"I\'m not your enemy,\" Mami heard herself say.

\"Really? Then what the hell are you doing here, with all... *this*?\"

Misa almost spat the last word in disgust, and Mami felt her stomach turn slightly. She was starting to see the outlines of what was going on here.

\"We\'re here to stop it,\" Mami explained carefully, eyeing Misa\'s hand nervously. \"We have nothing to do with what was going on here.\"

\"A likely story.\"

Before Mami could respond, a new magical signature flared into existence nearby, and more than that, an *aura,* unmistakable, even after two decades. Mami barely resisted the compulsion to turn and look.

*Homura,* she thought.

This time, she knew.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was no lead‐in to the next phase of the vision. Mami felt as if she had literally blinked, only to find herself outside again, looking out over a valley below.

It took her a moment to get reoriented. She was standing on the edge of a sheer drop, shaded by a temperate forest that was nearly Earth‐like, even if the tree bark was oddly‐colored. Next to her Machina and Homura stood likewise, gazing out at the scene before them.

Said scene, a lush valley nestled beneath the flat‐topped hill that hosted the provincial capital, was so idyllic it took Mami a long moment to realize what they were looking at.

Down below, angry trails of smoke emanated from what looked like the ruins of a building, complete with multiple craters.

\"Was it really necessary to have her be so dramatic about taking the building down?\" she asked, looking at Homura. \"Probably half the city saw that lightshow, and the other half *definitely* heard it.\"

The former First Executive\'s expression was distant, perhaps thoughtful. Mami knew that face: mentally, she wasn\'t really here. It always gave the impression that some kind of deep planning was happening, even if Mami knew for a fact that sometimes Homura was just plotting what to have for dinner.

\"Well, no,\" Homura said. \"And in fact it\'s probably a lot flashier than I\'d like. But it\'s hard to rigorously determine what someone will do after they\'ve been Reformatted. Even *with* consent.\"

\"I still can\'t believe she let you do that,\" Mami said.

Homura shrugged.

\"She understood the logic of the situation. She\'s over a hundred, so she\'s no spring chicken. The thing about getting that old is, you learn to do the smart thing, the thing that needs to be done. Even if you hate it.\"

Homura sounded sad, or perhaps angry.

Mami could only agree with the sentiment, even as she mentally shook her head ruefully at the situation. Something had happened here, something that Homura and her fellow... co‐conspirators... had moved to stop.

Was this why Homura had stayed away? If so, why did she feel she had to work separately? Why couldn\'t she trust her friends? That, alone, hurt more than Mami cared to admit.

\"So what now?\" the vision asked of Homura.

\"We go back to what we were doing,\" Homura said. \"You, me, *and* her. One day, we might have need of her again. Until then, we continue the work. The work is what matters.\"

\"The work is what matters,\" Mami agreed.

\"The mathematics here is truly inspired,\" Vlad said, holographic expression pulling itself into a ghoulish smile. \"Core 1 has been chewing on this class of problem for decades now. I\'d love to see the looks on their faces when they finally find out what the solution is. If they had faces, of course.\"

Director Tao closed his eyes in reaction to the comment, shutting the world out for a moment. He always thought more clearly with less sensory distraction.

He put his hand to his chin in a gesture of thought.

\"While I share your distaste for Core 1 and their, how shall we say, processing power fetish, I have to say it would feel a lot better if we* were the geniuses here. Gloating over solutions derived by others feels... less satisfactory.\"

The AI tilted his head.

\"Of course,\" Vlad said. \"But I will still enjoy it.\"

Tao smiled slightly to show his agreement.

\"Regardless of the origin of that particular insight, we have nothing to be ashamed of. This endeavor was the product of many minds. I brought champagne for a reason, after all. Shame you won\'t be able to share it.\"

He gestured at a bag he had tied securely to one of the poles in the room.

\"We AIs must live human experiences vicariously,\" Vlad said, raising one hand in mock toast.

Tao turned, gazing through the window in front of him, looking over the preparations that were finally near completion. Below him a work crew of research staff, along with many of Vlad\'s drones, ran final tests on the new experimental apparatus, far more elaborate than they had thought necessary before. As he watched, one of the signaling mechanisms began flashing a red warning light.

Many things about the situation felt odd. Being here on Adept Blue, collaborating with a formal rival. Standing on the observation platform watching others work, instead of working feverishly on the equipment himself. Several other things, such as the arrival of a prestigious magical girl observer that apparently had quite a lot of pull.

He couldn\'t help glancing over at the \"Clarisse van Rossum\" in question, who was already waving back at him. Worrisome, that one.

Above all he couldn\'t suppress his unrest at the origin of the solution Vlad had touted. An unknown benefactor, which Governance refused to disclose, whose advice they had been warned to scrutinize *very carefully---it was hardly a situation for much comfort. He knew Vlad shared the same concerns, even if the AI chose to project a confident facade.

Math was math, regardless of the source, but...

\"I understand the concerns we all share,\" Director Valentin said, evidently gleaning his thoughts, \"and this is the wrong specialty for me. But, if what you told me is true, the derivation prevented us from making a potentially disastrous mistake in the wormhole creation process. And the security specialist Von Rohr has fully verified the new systems. We can only have faith in our talents.\"

He nodded. He could have used a security specialist like that back on Eurydome.

\"Dr. Tao, Dr. Valentin, I\'m sorry to have to interrupt, but I believe the experiment is soon to begin,\" Vlad said, bowing his head at a slight angle.

Tao said nothing, knowing better than to disturb the computations of a laboratory AI with trivial social niceties.

Instead he watched silently next to Valentin, hands clasped behind his back, as the two girls stepped tentatively into the now‐empty vacuum chamber. Asami looked up at the new additions to the structure, which protruded bulbously from the walls. An inelegant design, but easy to calculate.

Valentin smiled down at the two of them and waved, and Tao followed the gesture a moment later. He really needed to learn to be better at that sort of thing.

The girls looked up, seemingly surprised by something.

Vlad raised a thumbs‐up gesture shortly afterward.

\"We\'re ready,\" he said. \"Don\'t worry if you don\'t get it right the first try. There\'s plenty of room for calibrations.\"

His voice boomed out of hidden speakers around them and, they knew, inside the suits of the girls below. A moment like this seemed to call for dramatic audio.

\"We\'re ready,\" Ryouko said, dropping Asami\'s hand, which she had been holding awkwardly. Even after all that time on Eurydome they still seemed uncertain around each other. They were, he thought, too young---his own daughter would be that old in only another half‐decade.

He pushed *that* thought far away.

Asami nodded in agreement with Ryouko, then turned towards the center of the room, raising both hands in the summoning gesture she favored.

Tao looked to the right, at the gravimetric monitor set into the right side of the observation window. He was hardly alone in doing so---Valentin was already staring at it, as were the few staff in the room behind them. Only Vlad stood impassive, with no need of visual monitors.

\"We are powering on the chamber,\" Vlad said. \"You will lose gravity in a moment.\"

There was no visible change in the chamber, but the monitor changed colors dramatically. A civilian might have expected the girls to start floating, but even a reasonably bright student would know that there was no cause for them to lift off the floor if they weren\'t moving.

\"You should feel a slight tug,\" Vlad said. \"That will be your signal that the arrangement is online, just as we practiced. You may proceed when ready.\"

The monitor lit up in an appealing arrangement of reds, greens, and shading, just as it had in their simulations. But they had done nothing new yet.

Then the center of the arrangement started turning a new shade of purple. Asami was at work.

\"Steady. No need to rush,\" Vlad said encouragingly.

Tao looked away from the monitor, unable to resist taking a direct view of something he still found oddly beautiful: A controlled singularity, a perfect circle of impossible blackness appearing in front of the girl\'s hands and heading inexorably for the center of the chamber. It seemed to move achingly slowly.

He held his breath for a moment until it floated into place, hanging in the vacuum for a quiet moment. Then he looked at the monitor.

\"First pulse imminent,\" Vlad said. \"Three seconds.\"

The monitor showed the brief countdown. Two. One.

Despite the reinforced structure around them, and the careful field cancellation, the room shuddered slightly, and Tao felt a tug towards the glass. He could only be amazed that the girls had somehow stayed still, resisting the pull without any source of counter‐force. Magic.

The monitor was exploding with shades of purple in the center. A second countdown appeared.

\"All personnel, brace,\" Vlad said.

Tao had already grabbed one of the handles on the wall. They had planned this.

This time the tug almost jerked him off his feet. He was envious that Adept Blue had generators of this kind of power.

\"You alright down there?\" Vlad asked.

\"Yeah, nothing I didn\'t see in combat,\" Asami radioed back. \"Not any worse than the dry run.\"

\"Last pulse,\" Vlad announced.

This time, rather than feeling pulled towards the window, he felt himself being shoved forcefully away, the pressure hammering his chest, such that it felt hard to breathe. He closed his eyes and gripped the handles tightly.

When he opened his eyes again, he relaxed. That was the last pulse, he knew, though he kept his hands on the handles just in case. One couldn\'t be too sure. He remembered vividly the act of sabotage on his lab.

\"She\'s doing it,\" Valentin said, seemingly unfazed.

Tao didn\'t need her to specify what she meant. The next step was to see if Ryouko could take advantage of the environment, and the girl was already raising her arms, matching her partner\'s gesture.

The room held its collective breath.

Then the singularity seemed to grow larger, to the size of a human head, then a wheel, then a small dining table.

With a sense of awe, he realized that it wasn\'t *black* anymore. Not perfectly. Instead, it was subtly brighter, and a moment later it seemed to clarify, providing a view of... stars. An unrecognized handful of stars gleamed through the hole in space‐time that rippled gently in the chamber below, the light at the edges swirling as if caught in an eddy.

He caught a glimpse of the monitor in the moment afterward, displaying a configuration he had previously only seen in models.

Then the circle vanished, and the girls dropped their arms, looking up at the assembled observers.

\"I\'d say that was successful,\" Vlad announced. \"You girls did great!\"

The room erupted into cheering, and Tao, smiling broadly himself, turned to start the celebration, reaching for the champagne in its reinforced glass.

Then he saw Valentin, who was still standing in front of the window, looking down, expression unreadable.

She turned around a moment later, probably sensing him watching. He raised the bottle questioningly.

\"Let\'s drink a toast, then,\" she said. \"Once you get that bottle open.\"

\"And once the girls get up here,\" Tao added.

\"\'To the girls,\' then,\" Vlad suggested. \"\'And all the hard work that made this possible.\'\"

\"\'And to the work yet to come,\'\" Valentin said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuma frowned as she watched Sayaka read the document for what was probably the fifth time. Obviously bothered by its contents, she held an odd, pinched expression, a grimace seeming to travel back and forth from one section of her face to another.

By the decision of Simona\'s soul mage, the document was written on what appeared to be old‐fashioned paper, but was actually self‐destructing on the molecular level, and would no longer exist in an hour or so, assuming they forgot to just toss it in a fire. One of the jokes she barely remembered from childhood had come to pass, though that sheet of paper wouldn\'t explode or anything as dramatic as that. Just disintegrate.

After that, the contents of those words would only exist in three places---in the minds of the soul mage, Sayaka, and Yuma. Yuma would have preferred to sample the memories directly, but the telepath with the relevant talent was still en route, and she didn\'t think it wise to transmit this one electronically.

The document had read, in part:

> The Trusted Computing Framework has been seriously breached. Not just in theory, not just in a few places for MSY reasons, but on some level deeper than that. That\'s what the girl\'s memories tell me. It\'s not just what she\'s been told; she has good reason to believe it, as I outline a bit below.
>
> Fortunately, there is good news. As we thought when we first accepted these implants in our bodies, magical girls at least are immune to the effects of this subornation. Other humans, including some AIs, are not as lucky, though the magical techniques we use to secure our own systems can be applied, with the right specialists. In addition, the subornation is not as serious as the worst case: they believe that there are serious limits to the power of whoever is orchestrating it, such that they can only act occasionally, within limits.
>
> That\'s the headliner here, at least. I\'m sure you didn\'t expect to read that in my report, but I thought it behooved me to put important things first.

Yuma paused her recollection of the text when Sayaka looked over at her, dusting it with a burst of red magic.

\"We always thought a day like this might come,\" she said, shaking her head slowly.

\"It is possible the soul mage, and Simona herself, are being misled,\" Yuma commented, \"but we have to take what is being said here seriously.\"

\"Yes,\" Sayaka said. \"Fortunately, we have preparations for that kind of thing. This isn\'t the first time someone has targeted the TCF.\"

\"Yes,\" Yuma agreed.

For a moment she stood there, watching Sayaka where she sat. There was no need to clarify the reference. They both knew what she was referring to. Sayaka more than most.

She closed her eyes for a moment. It might have been barely possible to try and keep all this among magical girls only, but that was both difficult and unnecessary. As both the document and Sayaka had alluded to, the MSY had techniques for \"verifying\" and, if necessary, purifying both ordinary humans and AIs. It would make things easier, bringing others in, even if it meant expending resources.

It wasn\'t just that, she knew. That was all true, but she had reasons of her own for wanting to tell MG, and it wasn\'t *just* that she would have difficulty operating if her own advisory AI didn\'t know the truth.

It... sickened her on some level to know that MG, who she had designed and raised herself, might be compromised in some way. There was no other way to put it. Still, they had to keep the circle of knowledge small until they knew what they were dealing with.

She shook her head at herself, and was for the briefest of moments glad that she was in Sayaka\'s Paris hideaway, rather than in one of her offices. Here at least they could show their dismay openly.

\"It would make sense to keep this confined to magical girls we can absolutely rely on, at least until we investigate further,\" Yuma said. "But we will definitely have to find some AIs we can verify and trust. If a coding breach exists in the TCF, nothing is better at finding something like that than a verified AI.\"

\"Agreed,\" Sayaka said, looking at her carefully. \"But even the AIs have specialties. Who is even capable of looking for something like that?\"

\"No one looks at the code base in that kind of detail anymore,\" Yuma said. \"Only the design and verification AIs, and we can safely assume that they\'ve been blinded to any such breach, or they would have fixed it long ago.\"

\"It does neatly fit the pattern of what happened on X‐25 with Sakura Kyouko,\" Sayaka said. \"Compromised drone, delivered from a factory where we still can\'t identify the flaw... we haven\'t been thinking big enough.\"

\"We haven\'t,\" Yuma agreed.

She paused, weighing her next words.

\"But then again, we always had Homura for that,\" she said. \"And I\'d bet half my soul she\'s involved in this.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simona\'s earliest memories were almost painfully mundane, and she could remember that far back clearer than most.

She had been a normal girl, or so she thought. Played with normal friends, enjoyed the normal pastimes, and even, briefly, went to a normal school.

Her parents were scientists, and what little she knew of the profession at the time had made her vaguely proud, something she would brag of to the other kids, even. The other kids seemed a little smaller, a bit slower, but that seemed normal to her, and her teachers even praised her. After all, her parents were smart, so why shouldn\'t *she* be smart?

She pressed her hand on the one‐way viewing pane, looking down at the wormhole experiment below. At her request, she was hidden, and she was doing her absolute best to keep her soul gem emissions suppressed. They didn\'t know she was here yet.

She smiled wistfully, amused at herself. How childish, despite everything.

Too often nowadays she thought of her parents in the past tense, she reflected. That was wrong; however much they had argued, however little they really liked each other, they had raised her all the same. Funny, she hadn\'t been able to wait to leave them before, and now she treasured the rare occasions she got to see them in person.

There was no safe way to communicate, after all.

She watched the technicians clear the room below, and couldn\'t help but feel a certain trepidation. She had known for a while now that this experiment would happen someday, been assured of her part in it, of all their parts in it. It was supposed to be a done deal.

It was only human nature to be nervous, she reassured herself.

She closed her eyes for a moment. Human nature, yes... she had certainly reacquainted herself with *that* a bit over the years. So many of her brethren had invested themselves wholeheartedly into the project, making it their everything, aspiring to be perfect agents. She certainly understood the impulse, but she couldn\'t help but suspect that maybe that was why none of them had been offered contracts.

When she was five, she had been told the truth. The truth about the current state of the TCF, and of the role of her parents, and her, in the countermeasure.

They were part of a secret experimental project to see if it was possible to design a small pool of human children with implants based on an alternate TCF, one presumably without the problems currently plaguing the main line, as long as the children were regularly examined by the right kinds of magic.

The sponsoring group had kept them secret from Governance, as part of an audacious gambit. They were the answer to the question: If Governance were potentially compromised, how could it possibly hope to fix its own problems, if its own agents might be compromised? The answer there lay with magical girls, and ensuring that in some sense the right hand couldn\'t know what the left hand was doing.

But a conspiracy like that was *always* short of manpower, and so had killed two birds with one stone. She and her sisters had been given a short, relatively normal childhood, but their growth to adulthood had been accelerated far more than Governance typically allowed. They represented a hedge of bets: on the one hand, adult agents for the conspiracy, on the other, a small chance of an eventual contract. They had, after all, been carefully pieced together from the recorded genomes of some of the most powerful magical girls who had ever lived.

She watched the experiment with sharp eyes, the two magical girls below her casting their spells inside the gravity chamber, without any idea of who had helped grant them this new success. Soon it would be done, and Simona would reap the rewards of her work, as limited as they were.

She knew the secrets in her memories were being carefully parsed by some of the most senior members of the MSY, that they would trigger an immediate reaction, and that they would wonder why a group supposedly dedicated to the TCF had information on the construction of stable wormholes, how it was they could possibly have forecast so much about the life of Shizuki Ryouko, what it was they got from all this.

She knew they would wonder, because she wondered too. Part of living her life was knowing only part of the truth, and while she had to believe that all she had done was in the service of something just, she would be lying if she said she never wondered.

But of course, Chitose Yuma knew that too, now.

That was part of why Ryouko was so important to her. Whatever happened, whatever the truth was, *she* was special, in more ways than one. She could use that to calibrate herself, if nothing else.

It took only a moment longer for the experiment to draw to a close. Successful, as expected.

She took a sip of alcohol from a cup next to her.

She needed to go join the party.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Come on, Ryouko! Surely you can lower your intoxication filters for an event like this!\" Elanis said. \"It\'s obviously a special occasion!\"

Ryouko shrugged slightly, shaking her head.

\"Don\'t pressure her,\" Eri said. \"If she doesn\'t want to, she doesn\'t want to.\"

The two of them glared at each other, and Ryouko took a sip of her drink to hide a smile. By this point, their bickering had become ritualized, and Clarisse was convinced it was hiding something else.

\"It doesn\'t matter,\" Asami said, rolling her eyes. \"She\'s very resistant to this kind of pressure. I distinctly remember once, during our combat simulations, we were holding a party after weeks of combat, and she still wouldn\'t do it!\"

Ryouko\'s smile turned into a grimace, and she was glad she still had the drink at her mouth. She didn\'t know if Asami\'s memories were distorted, or if she was remembering a different party, but Ryouko remembered a *memorial service*. One where she had been too traumatized to want to deaden her reflexes after weeks of being shelled.

\"I can\'t believe that!\" Eri said. \"You don\'t even want to know what we got up to in our sims. Let me tell you, when you think you could die at any moment, those inhibitions come *right off*.\"

Ryouko grimaced again, but was saved from the conversation by, of all people, Director Tao.

\"Now girls, she\'s just being responsible,\" he said, butting into their conversation seemingly at random. \"I wouldn\'t tell you what to do, but if any of my daughters were in that situation, I wouldn\'t want them intoxicated either.\"

It was an awkward comment, to put it mildly, and they just stared back at him dumbly for a moment, before Eri started laughing loudly. Both Tao and Eri had their intoxication filters set to moderate, she realized.

*Goddess, this is why I don\'t get drunk,* she thought at Asami.

Asami just rolled her eyes again.

\"What were your bodyguard training sims like?\" Elanis asked, after Tao stepped away, looking at Eri. \"I\'ve heard stories about what happens on the Kuroi side. Intense stories.\"

\"Well, Kuroi‐san did keep saying that she thinks you all are soft,\" Eri said, before blinking rapidly for a moment.

\"No, uh, offense. But they were... pretty intense. Though I can\'t say I know what the Shizuki ones were like.\"

\"I guess what are you even doing as a civilian bodyguard? I thought the Kuroi sent their girls off to work in combat at first.\"

\"Not the younger ones. We have a system, where the older ones substitute...\"

Ryouko lost track of the conversation, frowning to herself. Something was...

There was a magical girl in the area she didn\'t recognize, she realized with sudden certainty.

They fell silent in sequence as Ryouko tilted her head to look, starting with Asami. This was supposed to be a sealed space station. Any magical girls who were here were *new*, and Clarisse van Rossum being here was already a plenty big surprise.

Ryouko found herself looking at the back of Valentin\'s head for a moment, confused, before thinking to look *past* her, at the girl standing on the other side.

\"Goddess,\" she said.

She pushed her way past two small clusters of technicians, the other three girls in tow, making her way towards Joanne Valentin, Clarisse van Rossum, and Simona del Mago.

\"What on Earth are you doing here?\" she asked, as she reached the group, making it obvious with her gaze who she meant. \"Don\'t tell me you---\"

She stopped there, reeling herself back, then realized her second question was too ambiguous to be understood.

\"The last time I heard anything about you, you\'d gone home to Argentina,\" she said, resetting the topic with an implicit question. "Something about your parents.\"

\"I thought I didn\'t have any potential,\" Simona said, meeting her eyes. \"But it seems sometimes things change. I guess I was just unhappy with my life.\"

*Don\'t take her at face value,* Ryouko\'s TacComp thought, a rare interjection. *Remember the vision.*

Clarisse slid the memory into Ryouko\'s mind, of what appeared to be Simona waking up in a tank, then going on to look at Ryouko on the first day of class. She remembered, again, how Simona had inserted herself into Ryouko\'s circle of friends, benefiting from Chiaki\'s eagerness to help a transfer student.

*What does it mean for her to be here?* Ryouko thought, feeling the world threaten to spin around her once more.

She had been avoiding thinking about Simona, which was an easy task, with so much else pulling her mind away. On top of that, it bothered her to think about the implications of Simona being potentially complicit in the machinations surrounding her, so it was easier to just... avoid it.

*Not so easy...* Clarisse thought, echoing Ryouko\'s thoughts exactly.

\"Ah, yes, apparently Simona here has some connection with the institute that generated some of the latest theoretical wormhole analyses,\" Valentin said, making a vague gesture of introduction with one hand. \"I don\'t think I need to introduce you more than that, since I\'m told you both knew each other in school. It really is a small world, or perhaps Mitakihara is just a special city.\"

She said it jocularly, but with a frisson of nervousness, as if she could sense the unspoken tension in the air. Van Rossum just watched Ryouko silently, unreadable.

\"That\'s amazing,\" Asami said, sounding genuinely impressed. \"How did you end up working on the same kind of stuff?\"

*Is something wrong?* she asked, directing the question at Ryouko. *You kind of zoned out there for a while.*

*I\'ll tell you about it later,* Ryouko thought.

\"I wanted to make a difference,\" Simona said, shrugging and smiling. "I guess that\'s how something like that turns out. I\'m not really sure why I got sent up here, but I guess they thought I\'d like being with my friends. I can\'t say I\'m angry.\"

*Okay, we need to talk to Van Rossum right away,* Ryouko\'s TacComp thought. *She\'s physically here, and she\'s someone who is both important and will believe us immediately about the vision. She might be able to get answers quickly. I\'m not sure I like being on this tiny space station with Simona, given the circumstances.*

Ryouko started to nod, only catching herself at the last moment. It felt bad of her, treating Simona like an object of danger and apprehension, but she couldn\'t begrudge Clarisse the reasonable precaution. They\'d already been in one suspicious lab accident, as Director Tao could attest.

\"Well, it\'s definitely good to see you again,\" she said, concealing her mild awkwardness by sipping at her drink.

\"So I guess you saw the light show then?\" Asami asked, leaning forward. \"Pretty cool, right? I didn\'t think I could pull it off.\"

Simona paused, seeming confused for a moment.

\"Well, I definitely thought so,\" Clarisse van Rossum said, filling the silence with a coy smile. \"An impressive accomplishment.\"

Simona opened her mouth to say something.

\"Actually, do you mind if I talk to you for a bit?\" Ryouko asked, seizing the first opening she saw. \"I wanted to compare notes about the wormhole generator at Orpheus, but you know, it\'s a bit...\"

She made a vague hand gesture, knowing the others would catch the meaning.

*Classified.*

\"Sure,\" Clarisse said, with a deliberate shrug. \"Let\'s get some more food while we\'re at it.\"

Ryouko thought she felt Asami\'s gaze on her back as they walked away. Her girlfriend probably wasn\'t fooled.

*That was a remarkably smooth lie,* the other Clarisse thought. *I\'m impressed.*

*I\'ve had more practice than I like,* Ryouko replied, sardonically.

Clarisse led her to the snack table, pausing to grab a new glass of wine and plate of delectables.

Before Ryouko could think to grab anything, she found herself before a plate of what looked like... stalks of broccoli? They were too long and meaty‐looking for that.

\"*C2 Ambigolimax Fractus*,\" Clarisse said crisply. \"From Samsara. Quite pricey, and you should definitely try some, especially now that you have the military implants. They\'re *amazing* raw.\"

Clarisse smiled, leaning at Ryouko so solicitously that she felt compelled to pick up one of the... things and bite into it.

It tasted like... high‐grade sashimi, like she had eaten once, but with a smooth, creamy texture. It was---

\"Amazing,\" she said.

\"I know, right?\"

\"What is it?\"

Clarisse seemed to grimace a little, making a gesture with one hand.

\"Broccoli‐headed slugs actually,\" she said. \"I wait to tell people that most of the time. Local delicacy. The frond structures on the heads are quite fascinating, actually. Fractal neural structures. Xenobiologists love them. You... don\'t want to know what these things eat.\"

Ryouko made her own hand gesture, then grabbed a couple more from the pile on the table with chopsticks.

\"You don\'t want to know what *I* ate in the combat sims,\" she said.

Clarisse laughed, lightly, hair falling over her face.

\"I\'m glad you\'ve come out of your shell,\" she said. \"Come on, let\'s find a quiet spot outside to talk.\"

*Are you going to tell her I gave you that joke?* Ryouko\'s TacComp asked.

*Obviously not,* Ryouko responded.

They found their way out of the recreation area, drawing a curious look from Director Tao, who was chewing on one of the slugs thoughtfully.

*So what is this* really *about?* Clarisse thought, before they had even fully stepped out of the doorway. *I doubt there\'s anything about the wormhole generator I could tell you that you don\'t know already.*

*Am I that easy to read?* Ryouko wondered to herself. She had thought it at least a plausible excuse, even for Clarisse. She really needed to learn better.

*Well, easy enough, especially with some light mind‐reading. I\'d apologize, but it was appropriate given the circumstances.*

Ryouko blinked. She hadn\'t noticed at all. She wasn\'t surprised by that, just... bothered.

*Circumstances?* she asked. *What do you mean by that?*

*I know a little bit about Simona, enough to know that we\'ve been keeping an eye on her. I was told she\'d be coming, but to otherwise keep it quiet. Enough to arouse the curiosity, I\'d say. And your reactions* were *a little readable.*

Ryouko leaned against the wall of the corridor, glad she had conducted this gambit. She would have hated trying to keep her face straight talking to Simona while holding a telepathic conversation like this.

*Did you also read what I\'m going to ask you?* she asked.

*Yes,* Clarisse thought, *though not the entire context. I do know that a vision is involved. You may as well tell me in your own words.*

Ryouko made a face, eating part of another slug nervously.

She told Clarisse as succinctly as she could about the part of her vision that seemed to suggest to her that Simona was born in a vat, and had somehow had designs on her from the beginning. As she spoke, she realized there wasn\'t really much for her to say beyond that, and began to worry that she was overinterpreting.

*Interesting,* Clarisse thought. *I wouldn\'t say you\'re overinterpreting. The Goddess occasionally puts extra content in visions, but usually only when convenient. This definitely had meaning.*

Clarisse paused, seeming to chew over something mentally.

*When I was told she was coming, I was also told she\'d consented to having her memories read and verified,* Clarisse thought. *There was definitely a lot I* wasn\'t *told, but I was informed that while she was involved in some kind of conspiracy, she had no hostile intent. So far, what I\'ve read from her mind suggests that is true, though she has surprisingly good telepathic defenses. Suspiciously good on someone like her.*

*So she* is *doing something secretive,* Ryouko thought, physically shaking her head.

*Yes,* Clarisse thought. *I didn\'t really press for details, because I wasn\'t given much. I was just told to keep an eye on her.*

Ryouko closed her eyes for a moment, thinking. The situation with Simona clearly touched upon her directly, given their history and the connection to the wormhole experiments. And yet no one had told her anything.

*I\'m sorry, I have to say that\'s pretty...* Ryouko began.

*Bullshit, yes,* Clarisse finished, gulping more of her drink. *You\'re too demure sometimes. You should just* say *it. I have to agree it\'s terrible how you\'ve been treated. You made the right choice coming to me.*

Clarisse held up her empty glass, regarding it for a moment in the soft lighting from the wall panels.

*I will ask for more information right away, whatever they can furnish, she thought. *Though I can\'t promise anything. They seemed nervous, and not about Simona per se. That being said, I can assure you that she has no intent to harm you.*

*How can you know that?* Ryouko asked.

Clarisse took a breath, hesitating.

*She\'s in love with you,* the *other* Clarisse supplied.

*Precisely,* Clarisse confirmed, following the TacComp\'s thought without missing a beat. *Whatever mind‐reading resistance she might have, that shines through anyway. I assume you two have some history?*

Ryouko blinked, then looked away, feeling... embarrassed? Confused?

*You knew?* she asked her TacComp.

*Well, yes. I* do *review your memories in my downtime. It matches my models. I never mentioned it because... well, it was never relevant before. I didn\'t expect to see her again. Now, it\'s obviously very relevant.*

Ryouko could think of at least one situation where she might have appreciated the heads‐up, but let it go. She could guess at her TacComp\'s reasons: it really hadn\'t been relevant, and would have only served to distract her.

But that one time, with Asami...

\"What am I supposed to do with this information?\" she said out loud, raising her hands in exasperation. \"I\'m not blaming you, it\'s just... what? I don\'t even know.\"

*It\'s up to you what to do with it,* Clarisse thought, swirling her glass casually. *You have a relationship already, protect it, would be my advice. But in the end, it\'s up to you.*

Ryouko found that a rather odd attitude from someone who might very well be the oldest human alive.

*Well, part of growing up is making your own decisions, for better or worse,* Clarisse thought, shrugging. *Asking for advice is reasonable, but you and Asami and Simona is your own business. At least when it comes to romance. Now, about the rest of it...*

She paused for a moment, tapping the side of her glass with one finger.

*I find myself wondering why they let her come here,* she thought. There\'s no way they don\'t know about this, so why allow it? That\'s not something the MHD would ordinarily allow. What does she have over them?*

*Who\'s \'they\'?* Ryouko\'s TacComp asked, with a trace of annoyance Ryouko shared. *I know you can hear me.*

*I\'d love to tell you, trust me, but I was also told it was* extremely important I not share that information,* Clarisse thought. *Ordinarily, I wouldn\'t care that much, but they seemed very worried. I have to respect that.*

She paused, thinking.

*It\'s true, what Simona said, about being involved with the wormhole information. I was told her group provided it. But what kind of group has access to information like that? And why should we trust them? There are plenty of questions here.*

She shrugged again.

*Let\'s go back in. I think we might learn a bit more talking with her. I\'ve sent questions back to Earth. We\'ll see if they get answered.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"It\'s just like, she\'s so standoffish, you know? I mean, I get that she doesn\'t really want to be worshipped, but I can\'t help but be bothered that she doesn\'t communicate a bit more. Would it kill her to give a bit more information about what\'s going on? You\'d think she enjoys* butterfly‐effecting everything.\"

Maki made a vague agreeing noise, watching Kyouko as she groused. The Ancient was gesturing broadly with her hands, while her head rested on the pillow next to her---or, more accurately, the luxurious cloud of hair that at times like this seemed almost endless. Kyouko had always refused to convert it to the more modern, technological hair, which Maki felt was a good decision---prehensile hair on that scale would have been terrifying, in more ways than one.

She ran her hand idly through that hair, rolling over to bury her own face in it. It was very soft, and she knew Kyouko was just using her as a sounding board at the moment---there just wasn\'t much she could say when Kyouko wanted to talk about the Goddess like this, in terms which were at times confusingly familiar.

She noticed that Kyouko had stopped complaining, and wondered if she was about to make a move on her.

She did, sort of, placing a hand down on *top* of the blankets in a location that was only *mildly* salacious. Really more casually intimate than anything.

\"Something big is going on,\" Kyouko said, more quietly this time. \"I don\'t know what to make of it. All kinds of people---well, people, magical girls, organizations, goddesses---all kinds of people are making moves. People who usually just sit on their ass and watch the world go by. I don\'t even know what game is being played, but the responsible thing is to deal myself in. I used to enjoy that kind of thing, but I\'m old*, Maki. I see the appeal now of just staying at home minding your own business. I\'m worried.\"

Maki lay still for a moment, concealing her surprise in Kyouko\'s hair. She *hated* admitting she was old, except in snarky sideways remarks. Whatever it was that worried Kyouko worried *Maki*, then. She felt like she had to say something to reset the mood.

\"You don\'t like *sitting* on your ass,\" Maki said, tilting her head upward. \"Except in certain positions.\"

Kyouko laughed throatily, even if it seemed a little forced.

\"You should be ashamed,\" she said. \"That\'s a terrible joke.\"

\"Please, why would I be ashamed of that and not...\"

She made a vague gesture around the room, which was decorated by assorted ill‐placed pieces of clothing, and some artwork she had brought for the trip. Kyouko claimed she actually quite enjoyed looking at her art... which sounded exactly like something you would make up to butter up your lover, but Maki wasn\'t going to fight it.

\"There\'s nothing to be ashamed of there,\" Kyouko said, sitting up and letting the blanket fall off of her front side. \"Take it from your church leader. Seriously, though, I know you\'re trying to distract me.\"

Maki thought about saying something soothing and obvious, perhaps something about keeping faith in the Goddess, or how Maki would be there for her, but that seemed... trite, perhaps. Kyouko knew that already, and it would hardly be meaningful.

No, she had to think of something else, something Kyouko would actually hear.

\"I\'m trying to distract you because you\'re getting stuck in a rut,\" Maki said. \"Ever since you had that vision, you\'ve been in a kind of, I don\'t know, melancholy or something. You just go around complaining and worrying, and talking about how old you are. It\'s not like you at all.\"

Kyouko seemed to gradually still, opening her mouth to say something, then raising her hand as if to interrupt. Instead of gesturing, though, she simply let her hand drop, looking at it as Maki spoke.

\"What do you want me to say?\" she asked, without facing her. \"I *am old, even if I try to hide from it. Time comes for us all, in the end. No amount of May‐December romance is really going to change that. More like January‐December, if I\'m honest.\"

Maki was taken aback by the sudden moroseness, and indeed the frank honesty. She knew, of course, what their relationship was about on some level. Every relationship was a mutually beneficial exchange of some sort. That was what all the guides loaded into her implants said. But to just hear it said like that...

\"No, I\'m not being honest,\" Kyouko said, tapping her knuckles on the mattress. \"Not entirely. It\'s not just all this conspiracy stuff weighing on my mind. There\'s a reason I don\'t stick around with any one girl too long. Eventually it stops being brand new, and instead of making me feel younger, it just reminds me of what I\'ve lost.\"

Maki closed her eyes, feeling queasy for a moment.

There was no hiding the fact that their relationship was unequal. She had known that going in; she certainly knew the rumors about Kyouko. They\'d be together for a while, Kyouko would show her a good time, and she would make the Ancient feel younger again. That was how she had come to understand it, and she had thought it was okay. As a young artist who wanted to see a little of life before being sent into combat, it seemed very reasonable, certainly a better deal than she could have gotten otherwise.

At some point---slowly, almost imperceptibly---that had changed. Their feelings had changed, and Kyouko had started getting controlling. She had borne it, wondering if things would turn out differently somehow. Then, they had fought.

She bit her lip, wishing the computer in her head could tell her the answer here. She could read all the guides in the world, and none of them would tell her what to say to someone so much older, who was displaying a kind of vulnerability she hadn\'t imagined.

But maybe that was the answer.

\"Tell me, then, what you\'ve lost,\" she said, stretching herself forward to hug Kyouko from behind. \"Maybe then I can help you get it back.\"

Kyouko\'s hair poured in streams down her back, and for a moment they sat there, their quiet breathing a reminder that, despite everything, they were still human.

\"I don\'t know the answer to that,\" Kyouko said, shaking her head slightly. \"If I did, things would be better. But let\'s order some food first and talk about it? I\'m starving.\"

Maki nodded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"So, what do you think about all this?\" Nadya asked.

\"Hmm?\" Marianne responded, looking up at the other woman over a glass of... whatever local alcohol Nadya had ordered for her. It was some kind of special local distilled spirit, but frankly it didn\'t matter much to her what it was.

*You know, the vision stuff,* Nadya thought, switching to telepathy. You weren\'t a part of it, but I know Mami told you.*

Marianne peered around the room, on the lookout for mind‐readers who might eavesdrop. The bar, however, was mostly empty, not surprising given the odd afternoon hour. A few local women laughed at a joke in one of the dark back corners, and the bartender raised an eyebrow at her, but there was otherwise nothing to see.

*I thought this might be about something like that,* Marianne said, referring to Nadya\'s invitation to this bar. *I\'m not sure my insight will be any better than the others\'.*

Nadya rolled her eyes, smiling to indicate it was playful.

*It wasn\'t* just *about that. I also wanted to drink. I just thought I\'d make some conversation. And I really am curious.*

Marianne took a sip of her drink before answering, savoring the way it burned as it slid down her throat. She usually was more of a wine drinker, but spirits had their charms, especially recently.

*Honestly, as an analyst I\'m more bothered by what wasn\'t said than what was,* she thought. *There\'s a lot to think about at the edges. Why did Misa think she had to go outside the system for help? Most likely, she did try to look for help inside the system and couldn\'t get it. Why don\'t we have any records of that? And yes, we looked.*

Nadya sent a mental signal for her to continue, and Marianne gestured vaguely with her shoulders.

*The same question can be asked about Homura herself, of course, perhaps even more worryingly. She doesn\'t seem crazy or on some kind of spirit adventure or anything like that. She seemed rational, and whatever she was doing was good enough to convince Misa to voluntarily allow her memory to be wiped. Why then has she chosen to hide herself?*

She took another gulp of her drink and found it empty afterward. She set the glass aside.

*The most important question, however, has to do with the vision itself. I knew only a little about these things before today, and I\'m not sure I like them any better than I did before. It seems obvious that everyone involved thinks there\'s some kind of guiding force here, whether it be a magical girl Goddess or just some \'Soul of Humanity\' or similar superstition. The problem is, if that\'s the case, then I have to really question the motives of whoever this is. Why so much smoke and mirrors? Why not just tell us everything?*

*Superstition?* Nadya asked, tilting her head. *So I take it you\'re not a member of the Cult then?*

Marianne shook her head openly.

*No, I\'m not.*

They paused for a moment there, as if chewing on the thought, Nadya taking a moment to poke at a bar sausage with a toothpick.

*I\'m sorry if it bothered you,* Nadya thought. *It\'s just... Juliet never talked about her family much. I was just trying to make conversation.*

Marianne leaned back into her stool, and spread her arms up at the ceiling.

\"No, don\'t be sorry, it\'s not your fault. It just, still hurts, you know? You just surprised me.\"

Nadya cast her eyes down at her food for a moment, weighing what to say.

\"It\'s a little bit prying on my part, but you didn\'t like the Cult? Or your daughter\'s involvement in it? It\'s just... you seem a little bothered.\"

\"No, I didn\'t,\" Marianne said, putting her head in her hands for a moment. \"Why would I? That\'s why she was out there in the first place, even though I told her not to go. I told her that it might *feel satisfying to punch enemies in the face, but it wasn\'t the best use of her talents. There were other places where she could have had more impact. She said she had been *told* it would make a difference. By who? A magic *deity*.\"

She had raised her arm during her tirade, and barely avoided knocking over a glass in anger when she brought it down. The bartender had conveniently disappeared into a back room.

\"She sure showed me, didn\'t she?\" Marianne said. \"But did she have to die doing it?\"

For a moment Nadya thought she would cry, but she didn\'t, simply returning to her drink.

She waited a careful moment.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said. \"I know I said that at the funeral, it\'s just... you know, the thing to say.\"

Marianne shook her head.

\"This probably all seems a bit random, but it\'s been on my mind recently, with all that has been going on. Having you here just reminds me. She used to tell me about you all, since I actually had the right clearances. She said you were like the team mom, since you were the oldest.\"

\"She never said that to my face,\" Nadya said, chuckling slightly. "But yeah, it was kind of true. I *am* the oldest. I have daughters as old as Misa, and it hurt to lose any of them, just like it hurt to lose my own children, though I don\'t talk about it much.\"

It was a risky statement, even as cautiously as she phrased it. It was such an obvious expression of empathy that she was worried Marianne would balk. Not everyone liked hearing from their elders about handling tragedy. Some felt it belittling.

\"Somehow it didn\'t occur to me that you might have had children too,\" Marianne said. \"I always got the impression from Juliet that you had been in the organization for your whole life. In retrospect, that doesn\'t really make sense.\"

She leaned over, looking at Nadya thoughtfully.

\"I suppose I\'d like to hear from someone who isn\'t my MHD psychiatrist. So tell me, then: Does it ever stop hurting?\"

\"Not really,\" Nadya said, without pause. \"It only gets numb. Sometimes, it feels like it corrodes you. I understand why Ancients like Tomoe Mami don\'t dare get into relationships. Otherwise, how could you hold up so long?\"

\"You could delegate, or just have so many it starts to dull it out,\" Marianne said. \"That\'s what some of the Matriarchs do. It\'s always seemed a bit cold, to me.\"

\"Well, to listen to them talk, it\'s a struggle just to keep your humanity at that age. Personally, I\'m a little skeptical---it *must depend on personality. I\'m maybe halfway there, and I don\'t feel like I\'ve half‐exhausted life. Not even close. And even if you do, I\'ve found that living it again through your children, and grandchildren, gives it a new freshness.\"

She saw Marianne grimace, slightly. She weighed what she wanted to say: comments about how long life was, how there could be other kids if she found another spouse, other platitudes, and found them wanting.

\"Look, there\'s not much I can say that\'s useful. All I can say is that if you want to talk, you know how to find me. That\'s about as cliché as it comes, but it\'s true.\"

\"Sometimes cliché comments are all anyone wants to hear,\" Marianne said, shrugging vaguely. \"Thank you. And you know, the thing about Ancients is: they always look so put together, like they\'re ancient oak trees or something, but few of them really are. There\'s always something.\"

Nadya paused midway through sipping her drink, then set it back down.

*Is that some sort of comment about Mami‐san?* she thought, using Mami\'s usual nickname.

Before Marianne could respond, they both received the subtle ping that Kyouko, Maki, and Mami were nearly there, and that they should clear seats if necessary.

\"I invited them,\" Nadya said, shrugging at Marianne\'s surprised look. "I mean, the original plan was for us to find some place to meet anyway, right? Why not here?\"

Marianne turned back toward the bar, where the bartender was now back making a show of wiping glasses.

\"I guess that makes sense, but what\'s the plan then? We just sit here and drink?\"

\"We\'ve got full synthesizer ability here,\" the bartender said, looking at them with a solicitous eye. \"Though if you all are Earthers I wouldn\'t go for that myself. We do lots of local drink\'n\'eat specials and run a mean deep fryer. Anything local and fried would be a nice choice. You might try our fried curry.\"

Nadya, who had seen all manner of bar food in her time, didn\'t bat an eyelash.

\"Just bring us whatever you think we\'ll like,\" she said. \"You can put it on the tab.\"

The barkeeper nodded and rushed off. He seemed good at his job, Nadya reflected, but hadn\'t been able to conceal the gleam of gold in his eye. It was one she knew well from her own long years in the colonies.

\"The plan is, we enjoy ourselves,\" Nadya said, pointing at the table with one finger as if discussing a battle plan. \"We\'re going to eat greasy food, get drunk, get Sakura‐san to tell us all her dirty stories, and forget about all this other stuff, alright? You can\'t forget how to live after you have kids. Not in this day and age. Or it will eat you from the inside out.\"

Marianne shook her head, and for a moment Nadya worried that she had offended her.

\"I don\'t know that I want to see what Mami‐san is like drunk and listening to dirty stories.\"

She glanced over at the party at the other table, which was still chatting quietly. They would know who was coming soon enough.

The other girls showed up just a few moments later, Kyouko casting her eyes around the room at the lack of patrons, as if unsure whether to be happy or disappointed. They had holographic face disguises on, though she couldn\'t imagine it really made much of a difference---you would expect that anyone seeing two people who strongly resembled Mami and Kyouko walking down the street could put two and two together, though she supposed it was possible Maki threw them off.

Nonetheless they weren\'t tailed by any reporters, so they dropped into seats at the counter, dispelling their disguises.

\"It\'s been so long since I did something like this,\" Mami said, sounding a touch worried. \"I guess it is supposed to be a vacation, after all, though I feel like I should be taking a tour or something. I could go to a bar on Earth if I really wanted.\"

The sound of her voice caused audible exclamations of surprise from the other party, who had turned to look.

\"You can do that later,\" Kyouko said. \"There\'s no rule that says you can\'t relax with friends on a vacation.\"

\"I suppose that makes sense,\" Mami said, smiling in a way that made Marianne feel... odd somehow. It was so different, the Mami she was used to and the one she had seen on this trip.

\"Did you get any food?\" Kyouko asked, following her famously one‐track mind. \"I\'m starving!\"

\"Yes, we did,\" Nadya said, watching Maki roll her eyes in the background. Marianne could almost see Nadya making assumptions about Maki and Kyouko, but it probably wasn\'t worth going out of her way to dispel at the moment.

As if in response to her statement, the bartender reappeared with several plates of food, eyes immediately going wide when he spotted his new customers.

\"Blast! I would\'ve told the chef if I had known who was coming,\" he said, doing an impressive job of placing food on the counter despite suddenly shaky hands.

\"No need,\" Mami said, smiling one of her more typical smiles. \"It looks great.\"

\"Thanks,\" the man said, before retreating back into the kitchen.

\"This place must not be doing very well if they can\'t even afford any server drones,\" Kyouko said, grabbing a piece of food immediately. "That poor man almost dropped something.\"

\"He\'s just saving money out here in the colonies,\" Nadya said.

\"And I guess it\'s not really possible to hurt yourself anymore,\" Kyouko added, biting into her food savagely. \"Geez, I feel like I\'m losing touch with my roots or something. Wait, is this seriously curry*?\"

Mami laughed lightly, and it sounded like bells.

\"Come on, let\'s order some drinks,\" she said. \"It\'d be rude to come here without spending a little.\"

Marianne picked up a piece of piping hot... fish and nibbled gingerly. She supposed that even Tomoe Mami could relax every once in a while.

*I guess everyone looks different around their friends,* she thought.

She watched as Maki followed Kyouko\'s example and bit into her food sharply, nearly dropping her food in pain from the heat.

\"How much longer are you going to be out here?\" Marianne asked Mami. "It really seems like the break has done wonders for you.\"

*Just like it was supposed to,* she added, to herself.

Mami\'s face wrinkled, just a little.

\"Has it really?\" she asked. \"I haven\'t really gotten a chance to just sit down... but I\'m glad to hear it. To tell the truth, I\'m not really sure when I\'m going back. My calendar says another two weeks, but it\'s getting close to... when I expected I\'d be done.\"

There was a tiny hesitation during her last sentence, and Marianne had the feeling she was omitting something.

She tracked Kyouko giving Mami a look.

\"Let\'s not think about depressing things like going back to work,\" Kyouko said. \"We\'re supposed to be out here having fun, shooting the shit. Work will take care of itself. For now anyway.\"

To Marianne it seemed like an odd way of phrasing things.

Kyouko leaned over towards her and Nadya.

\"Well, I don\'t get to talk to either of you very much, except on occasions like this. How are things? How\'s the, uh, kids?\"

Kyouko hesitated a beat on the last question, apparently remembering about Juliet a bit too late, and barely managing to turn her head to address the question specifically to Nadya. Marianne didn\'t mind; Kyouko had done the polite thing earlier, and really she was a little tired of being treated like a glass doll, even after all this time.

She couldn\'t help but reflect that Mami would have never made a mistake like that.

\"They\'re fine,\" Nadya said. \"Vasily\'s been put on leave, since there\'s finally been a break in the fighting. Euphratic Front, you know. Elena is on vacation with the grandkids. Those are the youngest ones, so I keep my eye on them the most. I haven\'t talked to the others recently.\"

Kyouko nodded, and they sat there eating silently for a moment.

\"I don\'t like this mood,\" she said, after a moment. \"It feels like we\'re thinking too much about where we\'ve been and where we\'re going to be. Not living in the moment. Whatever happened to *carpe diem*?\"

To her surprise, it was Mami who responded first, shrugging broadly.

\"It\'s for those much younger than us,\" she said. \"To us older ones, the past may as well be the present, and the future time. It all sort of mixes together. That kind of talk is for someone like Kishida‐san here, who\'s younger.\"

Kyouko made a face.

\"Well, I just see Marianne here watching us like we\'re, I don\'t know, ghosts or something passing her by, and she seems *way* too young for that. I know you\'ve lost a lot, but who here hasn\'t lost *something*? You can\'t just sit around moping.\"

Marianne was taken aback by the sudden comment, and glanced around the room, dodging eye contact.

\"Well, I\'m just living life, I guess,\" she said.

Kyouko tilted her head slightly, then shook her head.

\"I ain\'t any good at this, but I\'m sure you know what I\'m trying to say. You\'ve probably heard it from more than just me, too. No one can tell you how to live, but...\"

She made a vague gesture with one hand, before taking a bite of some kind of fried mushroom‐like thing.

Mami made a pained expression for a moment, before smiling politely.

\"Well, you\'re not wrong about all of us having our losses, but we\'re mostly much older. It takes time to grow that kind of resilience.\"

In the background, Maki made an odd noise, almost like she were trying to clear her throat but had changed her mind.

\"Ah, well, I\'m not sure I\'ve lost that much,\" she said. \"But I don\'t think this sitting around drinking is doing us too much good. We should be doing something else, something more exciting, you know?\"

She paused for a beat.

\"You want to go dancing?\" she asked.

\"Dancing,\" Kyouko echoed oddly.

\"Yeah. This area is supposed to have a number of good clubs, and I don\'t know, it might be good fun, even at this hour.\"

Nadya shrugged broadly.

\"I like dancing, even if I usually do it with men. We\'d need some more alcohol to lubricate the situation.\"

They fell then into a familiar social problem, that moment where they each had some idea what they thought of the plan, but no one would say it for risk of offense. The younger crowd liked to use implants to arbitrate, but it had never caught on elsewhere. Everyone above a certain age knew what the real answer was---someone needed to take charge and just dictate an answer. But in their group, who *was* that?

\"Let\'s do it,\" Mami said, making what looked like a careful show of shrugging nonchalantly.

Kyouko, who had looked reluctant, bobbled.

\"Really,\" Mami said, sipping at her drink. \"It\'s been ages since I did something like that, literally centuries, and I know someone who\'d like to try.\"

She gestured vaguely at her own torso, where Machina was, a mysterious gesture that would nonetheless carry the right meaning for all of the girls there---even Nadya knew about Machina now, after what had apparently happened during the Far Seers séance.

\"If you\'re looking for places to dance, there\'s the Golden Liberty Hall down the way,\" the bartender said, reappearing at the counter. "It\'d be a shame to leave all this food here, but maybe you could bring it with you? We have containers.\"

\"No need,\" Kyouko said, before anyone else could interject. \"This isn\'t really that much.\"

She grabbed a fork and speared two things at once, as if trying to prove her assertion with the application of force.

\"They\'re a bit of an old‐fashioned place,\" the bartender said, wiping a glass stylishly. \"But honestly that\'d probably suit folks like you, no offense. It\'s uh, twenty‐second century classical revival? You can look it up.\"

\"It\'s been a while since I did a good waltz,\" Mami said. \"I think I might be out of practice.\"

Marianne smiled carefully, watching the others chat aimlessly. She hadn\'t been given a chance to object, really, nor would she have wanted to, but she had some reservations. It seemed... well, it wasn\'t her thing, really. Not unless she needed to surveil the participants.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She found herself bracing her arms on a chair an hour later, not so much physically worn out as psychologically.

\"Oh, yeah, you should have seen her back in the day,\" Kyouko commented, sipping with a straw at some couples\' cocktail she was sharing with Maki. \"Mami is *not* to be trifled with. She\'s inexhaustible. Or used to be. She wasn\'t kidding when she said it\'d been a long time.\"

Marianne thought she detected a moment of hesitation on Kyouko\'s last line, but shrugged it off. Ancients had long histories.

\"What about you two?\" she asked. \"Going to go back on the floor?\"

Kyouko and Maki turned in unison to watch Nadya and Mami go at it, to tunes that had been old when Mami was young.

\"Nah it\'s not really my thing,\" Kyouko said. \"When we dance it\'s more of lead in to other things.\"

She said it so dryly it took Marianne a moment to realize what she meant.

Maki rolled her eyes.

\"You know, she does that to embarrass her partner,\" she said sardonically. \"So they blush and get flustered. It\'s very cute, I imagine, but you get used to it. We can do it later, okay?\"

\"I\'ve ruined you,\" Kyouko said.

\"Damn straight.\"

Marianne finally took a seat, taking a chug of the drink she had left on the table.

\"You going to make a move on any of these fine gentlemen, then?\" Kyouko asked, casting her arm about the room, at the well‐dressed locals unabashedly staring at Mami and Nadya.

\"I\'m good for now,\" she said. \"Like hell I\'m getting any attention with *this* going on.\"

She took another sip of her drink, thinking back to her dance with Mami. It had been a lot more fun than she cared to admit, and Mami was of course a better dancer than her ex‐husband, even if allegedly centuries out of practice. But somehow it had seemed... too passionate, somehow, and Mami had obviously lost herself quickly. Where at the beginning she had avoided some of the more intimate motions, Marianne had quickly found herself led into embraces that would have made a more inclined girl blush. It was almost to the point that she thought Mami was making a move on her, except she knew way better than that.

\"She just has a lot to work out,\" Kyouko said, watching Marianne from the corner of her eye. \"She needed this break.\"

She didn\'t know how to respond to that, so she didn\'t, just watching silently.

The two dancers finished something, posing briefly to allow for applause.

Then they surprised her by walking off the floor, heading for their table.

She scooted her chair aside to give them some room.

\"Well, that was pretty fun,\" Nadya said, grabbing a drink from a server drone. \"You dance almost as well as my third husband. Too bad he was a pig.\"

\"I should be insulted,\" Mami said.

She took a long drink of something pink and alcoholic, then took a look at Nadya. They shared the kind of look that implied obvious telepathy.

\"I\'m too busy,\" Mami said out loud. \"I don\'t have the time, not now, not anytime soon.\"

\"If you wait until you\'re not busy, you\'re not going to ever have a chance,\" Nadya said.

\"Right, right,\" Mami said, shrugging vaguely.

She looked sideways for a moment, and at first Marianne thought she was thinking up a response.

The moment was too long, though, and she realized that Kyouko, too, seemed distracted by something.

*Something has happened,* she realized.

\"If you\'ll excuse us,\" Mami said, not denying the obvious. \"We\'ll be outside.\"

\"I wonder what that\'s about,\" Maki said, the moment they disappeared out the doorway.

\"Who knows?\" Nadya said, shrugging broadly. \"We all know there\'s something going on, but it\'s not like anyone tells Nadya anything. The only reason I know anything at all is because I was close with Misa.\"

Nadya waited a beat while they decided if she was being serious, taking a swig of her mug of beer.

\"Well, that\'s my fault, of course. If I had wanted to play in the shadows, I would have joined up, or at least gotten into politics. Was never my thing. You can see how stressed Mami usually is. I only mind when it involves one of my own.\"

Marianne drummed her fingers on the table. That was the life she *had chosen, but in this case she didn\'t know much more than either of them. She had to hope Mami would tell her about it later. That was something most people didn\'t get about this line of work---when they said layers of classification, they meant *layers*.

\"Fair enough,\" Maki said, shrugging in turn. \"Speaking of secrets, you want to tell us what that was just now with Mami? She hit on you or something? To be honest, I didn\'t think she was the type.\"

She directed the question at Nadya, not Marianne.

Marianne blinked, stopping her drumming. The thought hadn\'t even crossed her mind, but it fit the evidence. It just... wasn\'t Mami, like Maki was saying.

Maki paused, looking embarrassed, probably worried she had been too casual about one of the MSY\'s premier members.

\"It\'s just, you know, it\'s hard to imagine her doing something like that.\"

\"Everyone has to hit on someone at some point, if you want any action at all,\" Nadya said, taking another swig of her drink. \"But no, that\'s not what it was. I was actually suggesting, since she seemed so into it that, you know, maybe she try to go fishing a little. Might help with the stress.\"

\"She\'s definitely under a lot of stress,\" Marianne said, shaking her head slightly. \"A lot has happened with her recently. There\'s a reason she\'s on this break.\"

She didn\'t elaborate further, even though she had more to say, about how she suspected something had happened to Mami, something mental. She just... felt different, on those rare occasions she caught a glimpse of her mind. It seemed similar to cases she\'d seen before, but... she couldn\'t believe that. Not about Mami.

She knew her silence and body language would speak volumes, though, and Nadya nodded sharply a moment later.

\"I\'m not surprised. A woman like her---I said before leadership isn\'t my thing. No one has shoulders broad enough to bear that kind of pressure. It takes a lot to cope. Hmm.\"

They waited for Nadya to follow up, but she didn\'t say anything further, frowning slightly.

\"Hmm?\" Maki prompted.

\"Oh, I have some well‐connected friends who can find some suitable matches,\" Nadya said. \"All discreet‐like and such. I thought I\'d send some queries.\"

\"Oh Goddess,\" Maki said, rolling her eyes and pantomiming collapsing onto the table. \"What are you, a---\"

She stopped herself, clearly answering her own question. Nadya laughed.

\"A meddlesome mother, yes. You forget how old I am.\"

She took another chug, then looked at her glass, which was nearly empty, clearly pondering whether to order more.

\"They\'re taking a while,\" she said.

As if specifically to prove her wrong, Mami and Kyouko reappeared in the doorway, Kyouko shaking her head at something.

A couple of potential icebreaker jokes came to mind, but Marianne thought better of it and said nothing, allowing them to take their seats again with only a little awkwardness.

*I\'ll have to talk to you later,* Mami thought. *Not now, though.*

*Of course,* Marianne responded.

\"You want to go for another round?\" Mami asked, looking at Nadya.

\"Another? I thought you were tired.\"

\"I\'m not tired anymore.\"

Nadya shook her head.

\"I\'m sorry, I need a break. You\'re insatiable.\"

\"I\'m not sure when I\'ll get to do this again,\" Mami said, in an odd tone.

\"I\'ll do it,\" Kyouko said, putting her hand on the table decisively.

\"...if, uh, my companion here approves,\" she temporized a second later.

She shared a look with Maki, publicly signaling a telepathic conversation.

\"Yeah, sure,\" Maki said. \"I understand.\"

Marianne shook her head as the two women walked up to the dance floor. Something was up, and she wasn\'t sure she wanted to know.

But she *would* know either way. If there was nothing else she had learned from Mami, there was that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami had seen many night skies in her life, on many worlds, but this one felt nostalgic somehow. It was late, the planet\'s moon was out and the stars twinkled faintly. The clear nighttime air was relaxing to breathe, its chill bracing in her nostrils.

\"I\'m surprised she let you walk out here alone with me,\" she said, listening to Kyouko\'s footsteps alongside her, resonant on the cobblestones.

\"Come on, she trusts me at least a little, enough to let me walk with you*.\"

Mami chuckled, the kind of low laugh she used when she wasn\'t trying to give offense.

\"Besides,\" Kyouko said. \"I thought you needed it. You seemed very bothered by what Yuma had to say.\"

Mami closed her eyes, letting the breeze blow on her skin for a moment. Moments like these, where the mind was clear and the world calm, needed to be treasured, since in her experience it was one of the only ways to know what eternity might be like.

The purity of the remaining sensations, otherwise lost in the cacophony of daily life, helped her to focus on the just *being*.

She turned on her heel to face Kyouko, the long‐haired girl watching her, the empty roadway stretching into the distance behind her, silhouetted by dimly‐lit buildings and a sky full of stars.

Somewhere, a clock tower tolled.

\"Not bothered, not really,\" Mami answered. \"It\'s just, the things this girl said, about us needing new wormhole technology sometime soon, matched something else I\'d heard before.\"

She pulled idly on one of her hair curls, watching how it bent and unbent in the moonlight.

\"Before I took this trip, I was told I\'d get a few weeks to myself, to take a vacation, before I was needed again. Since then, it\'s always been in the back of my mind, since it seemed to imply that once that time was up, something would happen. And it\'s been a few weeks.\"

Kyouko watched her silently, eyes shimmering with pallid light.

Mami turned away, walking forward again.

\"Do you mind telling me about the last vision you had, at that Ribbon of yours? I\'m sorry if it\'s a bit prying, I just... wonder.\"

She heard Kyouko\'s footsteps falter slightly, just a little.

\"It\'s a bit personal, to be honest,\" Kyouko said.

\"I\'m sorry if---\"

\"No, don\'t be. I met Sayaka.\"

Mami stopped and turned, not bothering to hide her surprise.

\"Really?\" she asked.

Kyouko hid her expression.

\"I won\'t say much else, but she gave me a taste, just a sample, of what it was like to be dead. Not dead as in buried in the ground, but transcendent*. I saw infinity, eternity, but I also saw why we should treasure life.\"

Kyouko met her eyes, and Mami didn\'t see eyes of a delinquent, or an Ancient. Just a girl, one who, for once, spoke without affectation.

\"And why is that?\" Mami asked, following the prompt.

Kyouko held up one hand, then made a gesture as if snatching something.

\"This! Time itself. There are no *moments* in heaven. No tomorrow, no yesterday. You will never dance, never eat, never touch. You just *are*. Heaven is not *better* than earth, only *different*. And the dead miss earth.\"

Kyouko was looking up at the sky, hand raised, face full of emotion, and then she remembered where she was.

\"I should, uh, remember that for a sermon or something,\" she said, looking down, face brightening in infrared.

\"That wasn\'t bad,\" Mami said, laughing softly.

\"To think that\'s how it is...\" she said, ducking her head.

Kyouko rubbed the back of her head.

\"Actually, to be honest, my memory is a bit hazy. I just remembered I wasn\'t supposed to say any of that. But maybe it\'s alright if it\'s you.\"

She seemed to lose her energy then, shaking her head glumly.

\"If only I could really live what I just preached,\" Kyouko said. "I\'ve tried, you know? But the older I get, the more it feels like I\'m losing it. It sucks.\"

Mami tilted her head, feeling a bit at a loss. She didn\'t really know how to answer that.

\"I don\'t know either,\" she said. \"I think we all have a little of that.\"

She turned again, indicating she wanted to keep walking. Kyouko followed a moment later.

\"So are you going to join the Church or what?\" Kyouko asked. \"It\'d be a big deal for us.\"

\"That\'s *exactly* why I\'m not joining anything,\" Mami said, scoffing. \"I\'ve read your doctrines. Your Goddess doesn\'t need worship. Doesn\'t want it. Which seems very reasonable to me. Can you imagine the political headache?\"

Kyouko scoffed back.

\"I thought you\'d say that.\"

\"I got a notification just before we left,\" Mami said, without breaking her pace. \"They want me back at the General Staff, not right now, just soon. Tomorrow even. Something unusual is happening. So, you know, I thought I\'d make the most of my remaining time here.\"

\"I see,\" Kyouko said, letting out a breath.

Something made Mami stop again, turning to look at the other girl. Kyouko took Mami\'s hands in hers, clasping them together in a simple gesture of reassurance.

\"May the Goddess watch over you.\"

> ...but while the impact of the revolutionary Project Janus can hardly be overstated, it is not true that it has removed *all* constraints on interstellar travel, coordination, and management. Put simply, the mechanics of FTL travel create logistical constraints that would be recognizable even to the pre‐Unification Wars pioneers of the 2100s.
>
> The key observation is that maintaining FTL travel is energetically expensive. *Exorbitantly* expensive, by pre‐Project Icarus standards, even after the numerous topological innovations made by Janus physicists. One of the most important coincidences of FTL travel, then, is the fact that certain forms of \'exotic\' matter are both useful in space‐time manipulation *and* extremely energy dense, once they decay into more ordinary forms of matter. This enables slow‐decaying forms of exotic matter to be treated as a form of fuel, a single material that can be produced and loaded onto ships to power their journey to the stars.
>
> However, the sheer energy expense of exotic matter production requires its synthesis under the most energy‐rich conditions, such that exist in only a few places in settled human space, in the solar‐orbiting exotic matter refineries of the Core Worlds, and in particular of Sol, harnessed from the swarms of sun‐facing satellites orbiting these stars. This production is so important to both military and civilian traffic that it is by far the largest single expense on the Governance energy budget.
>
> Close inspection of interstellar fuel expenditure thus reveals a situation that could be easily explained to the earliest rocket engineers. To wit: The maximal practical FTL range of a ship is constrained by the amount of fuel it can carry when it leaves the nearest fuel source. The faster the travel intended, the less efficient the travel---and the necessary fuel‐to‐cargo mass ratio rises exponentially with the desired maximum velocity. Still, nothing prevents the building of larger vessels, which enjoy considerable savings in other aspects of space travel.
>
> Viewed in this light, the logistics of FTL commerce and military traffic are completely intuitive---civilian travel is much slower, providing enormous fuel savings. Military craft, which must travel with lightning speed, carry and use much more fuel, and are frequently much* larger, all the way up to battlecruiser class, but every sector has its own home fleets, and each system its own less FTL‐capable defense ships. Finally, to service the mobile fleet, Governance maintains fuel dumps throughout settled space, which are in turn serviced by enormous, heavily‐guarded fuel ships.
>
> While recent years have seen the rollout of impressive amounts of solar capacity in otherwise distant systems in a bid to make fuel production more local, the fact remains that exotic matter synthesis is a highly centralized affair, *the* logistical weakpoint of Governance operations, and for that matter of Cephalopod operations, as all available evidence suggests that, aside from the much‐coveted wormhole technology, alien logistics are little different...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was with a sense of foreboding that Mami stepped back into the virtual conference room of Carthago station. She had savored a relaxing morning, aided by a Machina‐facilitated power nap. Before this trip, it had been too long since she had been able to take her early morning nap. Some habits died hard, and even without the technical need for sleep, it had just seemed *wrong* not to sleep at some point in the night, even if she spent most of it still active.

That was her peacetime habit anyway, and part of her was surprised she was still sticking to it on this vacation.

Still, no amount of stalling or hiding could put this off indefinitely. Indeed, she was still in the process of leaving New California on a specially appointed military frigate---they technically hadn\'t told her they needed her physically back right away, but she could read between the lines.

*You\'re distracting yourself again,* Machina thought.

*Just let me have this, no one else is even here yet,* she thought.

She felt a small spurt of worry, a bit of feeling her TacComp allowed to leak out. It reminded her of... well herself, really. Worried about one of the girls she was taking care of.

She shook her head, slightly, as she took her seat at the table---not at the head, which she was leaving for Feodorovich for this meeting. With the passage of time, she had gotten more used to Machina, more used to having someone looking out for her. It had made her realize just how lonely it was at the top, so to speak.

Still, this Tactical Computer project had clearly been a disaster, and she would have to get the ball rolling for research on a separation project.

Somehow. She was given to understand it might be difficult.

Feodorovich herself arrived next, unusually early, appearing directly into the chair. Mami nodded at her, and she nodded back. When one "arrived\" was often just a matter of social timing, since every general could split their attention among a few tasks if they had to, and there was nothing terribly difficult about sitting in a chair and waiting. The only thing that was unacceptable was to be late to a plenary session without a *very* good reason.

The others began arriving shortly afterward, each entrance an expression of personal preference. Some political allies arrived together, and some chose to walk in the door, as Mami had.

When everyone had arrived, Feodorovich tapped the table for attention, the chatter taking a while to subside. The silence did not arrive instantly, as it had for Erwynmark or even for Mami before. Part of it was that Feodorovich was not the actual Chair, but part of it was also a signal to Mami herself. Her power and influence were waning thanks to her leave of absence, and the well‐justified questions about her fitness that it brought up.

\"I\'m not going to waste too much of everyone\'s time with pleasantries,\" Feodorovich said. \"You all know meetings like this are rarely called, and almost never by an interim chair. Yet it\'s not an emergency meeting---I haven\'t roused anyone out of their beds.\"

A chuckle sounded around the table; it was nearly impossible to rouse anyone on the General Staff out of their beds, given that they barely ever slept. Still, the point was made.

\"So it\'s not an emergency,\" she said, standing up. \"But it *is urgent, and important that we start working on the problem right away.\"

She made a show of clearing her throat, then called up the table\'s holographic display. Rather than the usual sector maps or fleet statistics, it displayed a short clip of what appeared to be Cephalopods working in a modern industrial facility. The video was fuzzy, not in the oddly‐colored, overly smooth way that typified noisy reconstructed images, but in the human way---details appeared and disappeared from focus, objects faded and returned again, and the whole thing seemed a little surreal.

Mami knew what it was right away, of course, even as the hologram switched to what looked like a distant view of an alien space station, full of docked ships, then to the more typical sector diagram they were all used to. At the moment it showed the Euphratic Sector, though zoomed out so that no detail was displayed, not yet.

\"What you will see here is the latest intel on Cephalopod deployments against the recently‐reclaimed Euphratic Sector, the fruits of the experimental Coeus Project, which some of you will be reading about for the first time. I won\'t belabor that, as you should all now be receiving the needed files and can read it afterward at your leisure.\"

Feodorovich made a slight gesture, and the hologram zoomed in and past the sector, to the Cephalopod‐controlled region of space. A silence settled over the table as those seated took in the information, faces darkening in turn as they grasped the ramifications.

\"The alien forces here are in much better shape than we had anticipated, as you can see,\" she said, in her high, almost rasping voice. \"They\'re not ready for a new offensive yet, far from it, but they are vastly ahead of where we thought they\'d be after the collapse of the previous offensive. This breaks the pattern of the previous two decades, as it indicates that they launched the previous offensive with a substantial reserve lined up.\"

She paused rhetorically, with the air of someone doing a practiced job of delivering bad news---a combination of detached professionalism and just enough body language to indicate that, yeah, she felt the bad news too.

\"Our AI analysts believe there is a very good chance they will choose to hit us again in the same spot, and if they do, even a maximal effort won\'t get us anywhere near as well‐defended as we were last time. Not without committing crippling amounts of our mobile assets. And we all know how things went last time.\"

\"In some sense it\'s not surprising that they would have reserves, is it not?\" Sualem asked, taking advantage of the momentary pause. \"We all saw that fleet they tried to ambush us with at Orpheus. All those ships must have gone *somewhere*.\"

\"Well, with all due respect, I think we were hoping they had found their way inside a black hole,\" Anand said, tapping the armrest of her chair with her fingers.

That triggered a nervous laugh around the table.

\"There\'s no reason to believe these new forces have anything to do with *those* ships,\" Feodorovich said. \"It is still an open question just what they are doing with that fleet.\"

\"From a bigger picture point of view it\'s not all that surprising they have a fleet they\'re just not doing anything with,\" Mami commented, shaking her head unhappily. \"We know they should have all kinds of resources that they just never seem to use.\"

\"I would say they\'re using it now,\" Sualem said. \"Maybe. We all know that this war is very confusing. But you were saying?\"

He gestured at Feodorovich, whom he had seemingly interrupted earlier.

\"Actually I was going to talk on the same points,\" she said. \"But ultimately, we can save the high‐minded discussion on the nature of the war for later. I propose that, ultimately, given our current situation, we must ask Governance for more resources for the war effort. This recommendation comes endorsed by MAISL---the long‐term is the long‐term, but first we have to get there.\"

*That* caused a stir among the assembled Marshals and Admirals, many of whom made a visible show of discomfort. To them, making a request like that was a concession of failure, of not achieving their goals as an organization.

This wasn\'t like the old wars of human history, where there was a visible enemy to be destroyed, over which victory would mean everything. They still didn\'t even know where the alien core worlds *were*.

So the General Staff prided itself on doing the absolute most with the resources they were given, stalling the war as long as possible while Governance grew larger and larger. It was the only way.

\"If... we have no choice, we have no choice,\" Sualem said, after glancing over at Admiral Miller. \"There\'s not much to be said about it. There\'s no reason to contest the logistical projections of MAISL.\"

Mami released the breath she hadn\'t known she was holding. The Sualem‐Miller faction had made no secret that they were unappreciative of her position in the General Staff, but since taking the chair she had noticed what Erwynmark had---they only played politics on the small stuff, never the big stuff. It earned them a smidgen of respect from her.

Just a smidgen, though.

\"I would say, though,\" Sualem began, leaning forward and clasping his hands together.

He looked around the room dramatically to make sure he had their attention.

\"I would say that I hope we\'re not just going to sit back and let things play out so simply. The projections are what they are, but we have to look for something else we can do, some other angle to all this. It\'s what Erwynmark would have done.\"

Ah, *there* was the Sualem she knew, unable to resist a dig at the current leadership. Still, he had a point, even if it was an obvious one.

\"I\'m sure no one is saying that we should only do the *obvious things,\" Mami said, leaning forward. \"Of course we will explore all the possible options, and we welcome any proposals of merit on the topic, even the outré ones.\"

\"Yes,\" Feodorovich said, agreeing. \"We have already begun developing a number of potential operations, mostly focused on delaying the Cephalopod build‐up inside their region of control. Unfortunately, as you can see, it is not simply a matter of repeating the Saharan Raid, not without turning it into our own major offensive, which is not something I think we are equipped for.\"

She paused, looking out over the table to see if anyone wanted to say anything.

\"I would like now to present a few of those proposals for general discussion.\"

The hologram over the table changed form, displaying a set of symbols overlaid on the map that Mami and the rest of the Staff interpreted readily: bomber‐class craft traveling from bases in the Euphratic Front to attack points inside Ceph space.

\"One of the most straightforward proposals is to begin deploying the experimental long‐range bomber fleet,\" Feodorovich said. \"They performed well in the battle around Orpheus, and it is possible that we may finally be able to begin attempting the kind of long‐range harassment the aliens have always done to us, if we are able to achieve penetration with a few test sorties.\"

\"I thought those bombers weren\'t in mass production yet,\" Anand said, shaking her head. \"The last report I read said that the models used at Orpheus are still too resource‐intensive to use profitably. And I\'m not sure it\'s that clear what we\'d achieve with attacks of this sort. We have to inflict more damage than we receive, which is a testy proposition even when the Cephalopods attack us at long‐range. MilAdvise doesn\'t think the odds of that are that much better than a coin flip. Maybe 58%.\"

Some murmurs sounded around the table.

\"The real risk would be tipping our hand, demonstrating to the aliens that we are working on this kind of technology,\" Fleet Admiral Chang said, making a gesture with one hand. \"But we made that decision already, when we deployed them at Orpheus. Beyond that, there is no reason to fear making the attempt. This is what we built them for. If they\'re ready, they\'re ready. If not...\"

He paused for a moment, looking around the table.

\"Well, we\'re asking for more resources anyway, aren\'t we?\"

\"If nothing else it will be a good field test,\" General Alexander said, tapping a finger on the table. \"Simulations are one thing, but we\'ll never know how they really perform until we actually see them in their intended role. Two birds, one stone. Always efficient.\"

\"As long as we don\'t risk too much,\" General de Chatillon added, glancing at Anand, who was still shaking her head. \"The last thing we need is to have them unavailable when needed elsewhere. Or have them start piling anti‐bomber defenses into the sector.\"

\"I think some manner of caution is warranted,\" Mami agreed. \"But I think we can count them stacking anti‐bomber defenses as a success, not a failure. It would still be resources drawn from elsewhere.\"

She looked around the table, then glanced at Feodorovich, who nodded in turn.

\"Very well, not many objections,\" she said. \"Let\'s move on.\"

The hologram hovering over the table shifted again, this time displaying a pattern of target facilities near the border with human space.

\"Another possibility we have investigated is drastically stepping up the pace of our special operations in alien space, both conventional and otherwise. While it seems like a natural option, the MilAdvise simulations have not been terribly positive. We all know how irreplaceable these kinds of magical specialists are, and we don\'t really have the capability to hit targets beyond a certain depth---and the aliens know this, meaning they keep the really important ones further back. Blowing up border defenses might make life easier for the bombers, but is unlikely to have any serious strategic effect beyond making them nervous.\"

\"I almost prefer them *not* nervous,\" Sualem said, shaking his head disapprovingly. \"Most of our best successes have been when they got too cocky. I think I have to agree that this might not be the best of ideas.\"

Glances were traded around the table, and though no one else spoke up, it was obvious that the consensus agreed with the given assessment.

\"Well, let\'s think outside the box a little,\" Mami said, gesturing at the holographic display. \"What target *could* we hit that would have a real impact? We might not have the range for it now, but we might be able to come up with something if we know what we\'re trying to do. Even for a one‐shot operation.\"

\"Well, a wormhole stabilizer is the obvious candidate,\" Feodorovich said. \"Except that, unfortunately, they seem to have anticipated that particular trick after the Saharan Raid. There are several wormhole stabilizers in the area, all buried very deep in their territory, and it\'d be quite a hat trick to hit them all. We had enough trouble with just the one at Orpheus.\"

\"They seem to have realized that while we may be quite good at incredible one‐time feats, managing an incredible feat four or five times in a row is a lot more difficult,\" Sualem said sardonically, gesturing at the sector map laid out before them. \"And given what we\'ve seen so far, it seems wormhole stabilizers just *aren\'t* as expensive as all that. Certainly not more expensive than the average fleet. That they didn\'t have any redundancy earlier in the war was... simply another expression of alien arrogance.\"

Mami allowed some skepticism to show on her face, even if she privately thought Sualem\'s explanation more likely than not. The man had a taste for stating his guesses with a lot more certainty than she personally liked.

\"We face an interesting conundrum,\" Chang commented, clasping his hands on the table. \"Like all things in this war, this alien build‐up is massive, so massive that it is difficult to imagine we can ever slow it with pinpricks. But, given how difficult it is to score knockout blows, we *must* ask ourselves whether it is possible, and if so, how many pinpricks do we need? Which approach is better? Our problem is that even a *Cephalopod AI* with full access to their logistics databanks might struggle to answer that question, so what hope do *we* have?\"

The table was silent for about ten seconds, as they interpreted what Chang had said and thought about the question.

\"I would say that with no other information, it would still be better to go for knockout blows,\" Anand said. \"After all, we\'re good at incredible one‐time feats, as Sualem mentioned. That is the specific advantage MagOps grants us. If we allow ourselves to be drawn into a long grind of mission after mission, then our performance will trend towards the average, an average the aliens will be able to estimate. The last thing we want is predictable outcomes, because they can almost certainly calculate those better than we can.\"

\"While I am inclined to agree,\" Chang said, \"that still leaves us the question of what big knockout punch we can land. Are there any ideas?\"

\"We need to hit something that they can\'t build multiple of,\" Mami mused, tapping her fingers on the table. \"Something that would simply be way too expensive to replicate, and something they *have* to keep close to the border. Something fixed.\"

\"Everything we know of matching that description is prohibitively well‐guarded,\" Chang said, shaking his head, not in disapproval but dissatisfaction. \"For example, the exotic matter fuel center for the region would be a perfect target, if they didn\'t keep a massive fleet around it constantly, and if it wasn\'t manned by what looks like a huge garrison. I mean, it only makes sense.\"

The table murmured. Managing to strike the sector‐wide fuel center was analogous to managing to strike one of Humanity\'s core worlds---more than analogous, since the Core Worlds, Earth in particular, did house Governance\'s own fuel centers. It would be a logistical disaster if it happened even once.

It was also a pipe dream, even if the General Staff had spent more time than they liked to imagine fantasizing about it.

\"Perhaps if there were something they didn\'t think we knew about, similar to the wormhole generator at Orpheus,\" Anand said, tilting her head slightly. \"After all, it must be enormously expensive to guard everything important as if we could strike it at any time, especially if we haven\'t actually shown the ability to do so yet. It would be a *lot cheaper to just leave something unusual, something we don\'t know about, as unostentatious as possible. After all, why would we attack something we don\'t even know the purpose of?\"

\"How would we even go about finding something like that?\" Chang asked.

\"There *are* a lot of new unknown alien facilities in this map,\" Mami said, leaning forward to take control of the hologram herself. \"Over a hundred, in fact. We might want to start taking a look through them, if we can. Continue the surveillance program, turn our telescopes towards these systems, whatever we can. Who knows?\"

\"I\'m a bit skeptical that the aliens really have some important critical facility that we don\'t know about,\" Sualem said, steepling his fingers, and watching Mami carefully. \"But I have to agree that it probably doesn\'t hurt to try. We have plenty of telescopes, and worst case we learn a bit more about the aliens. I\'d just hate to lose more of our surveillance assets.\"

\"Me too,\" Mami said, making a show of looking through the list of unidentified alien facilities.

It really didn\'t look all that promising, even sorting for the ones the AIs had marked as particularly likely to be important. An unusually large wormhole generator facility, a strange deep‐space depot, a ground installation on a volcanic planet engaged in high‐intensity mineral processing, some tantalizing glimpses of a facility seemingly orbiting a known pulsar---since why would the squid do their science there? There were plenty of other pulsars.

But nothing here struck her as likely to cripple the alien war effort, even if it could be deleted with a snap of her fingers.

\"But we have to try,\" she said. \"We have to try everything, as long as it doesn\'t cost too much.\"

Part of her knew that this decision was certainly consigning someone somewhere to their death, but that was the kind of thought to be pushed into a corner and thought about later.

Feodorovich looked around the table for any dissent.

\"Alright, we may as well,\" she said. \"That does it for the ideas we\'ve already come up with. Let\'s adjourn for the next 24 hours and then come back with fresh ideas. Tomoe Mami will return as Chair for that session.\"

Technically, Feodorovich hadn\'t discussed that with her yet, but it was obvious: it would have weakened her authority even further for her to continue to let Feodorovich or Anand run these meetings when she was obviously back, and Mami certainly wasn\'t the type of person who would want to save herself the work.

The members of the General Staff immediately began fading out of the room, returning to their duties or, if they felt they had something to say to each other, retiring to private discussion rooms. Those who wanted to talk to the Chair stayed, and in this case that meant Anand and Mami.

\"I wasn\'t sure if I offended you by not telling you anything beforehand,\" Feodorovich said, turning towards her. \"You did a good job of not looking too surprised.\"

\"I knew it couldn\'t be anything good,\" Mami said. \"I would have asked if I really wanted to know. I just thought, you know, I could stand to have another day to myself.\"

Feodorovich\'s lips turned upward, just a little.

\"Being here wears on you after a while, doesn\'t it?\" she said. \"Just problem after problem, many of them unsolvable, except you\'re expected to solve them anyway. Day in, day out, never one enemy to shoot or one person to talk to and fix it. Only work and more work. I thought it would get better as I got older, but it really hasn\'t. I can\'t imagine what it\'s like for you.\"

Mami looked down at the table, then up at Feodorovich.

\"It\'s what we signed up for,\" she said. \"It\'s a bit much to complain about what we go through, compared to what the average foot soldier goes through. It seems silly, to do the same thing for month after month and year after year, and have it all suddenly get to you, but it happens anyway. I needed the break; I should take more in the future, as circumstances permit.\"

These were words she never would have dared say to most people on the General Staff, but these were some of her closest political allies. If they* couldn\'t hear it, who could? And unlike many in the MSY, they shared her experiences here.

The other two looked surprised to hear her say this, but nodded a moment later.

\"Just so,\" Feodorovich said.

\"I just wanted to check in on you,\" Anand said. \"Since, you know, you\'ve been gone for a while. I don\'t have to tell you some of the marshals here aren\'t sold on you. Your performance on this matter will weigh on their opinions.\"

Mami smiled slightly.

*No pressure,* she thought.

\"Also, before you get right to work, I\'m told there\'s some new results from Adept Blue you might want to have a look at. When you get the chance. I think it might be very intriguing.\"

\"Noted,\" Mami acknowledged, smiling.

*Back to work, then,* Machina thought, with what felt like a sigh. *A shame, I was enjoying our vacation.*

*Yes, back to work,* Mami thought, holding her smile. Machina had sounded almost childish for a moment there, which only seemed appropriate given how young she really was.

It made Mami feel better, somehow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I can\'t believe this kind of thing is legal,\" Asami said, stretching out her arm to take a careful look.

\"Strictly speaking, it\'s not,\" Azrael said, shrugging her tiny shoulders vaguely. \"I certainly haven\'t gotten this simulation to run on any other Governance server. At least not the bodymod parts. I worked out an arrangement with Vlad.\"

Asami seemed to think about that a moment, even as Ryouko and Patricia took turns flicking their nictating membranes over their eyes, marveling at the novelty of it. It seemed to cast the world behind a pale yellow lens.

At the moment, that world looked deceptively prosaic, nothing more than the four of them standing about a mostly normal‐looking living area. It was a bit cramped---that was no different from Earth---and the ceilings were lower, though that was less noticeable with their now‐reduced size.

Really, the only differences were the odd chairs, which all had grooves for comfortable placement of their spinal thorns and tail buds, and the windows, which looked over a view which, well, Ryouko hadn\'t yet dared look at, lest she be unable to stop looking.

\"Vlad is awfully accommodating,\" Asami said.

\"Many AIs are,\" Azrael said. \"Especially since they don\'t see body modification as all that unusual, at least not as much as humans do. It was Director Valentin\'s idea, though. I guess I shouldn\'t be surprised she was read into the secret at some point. She\'s awfully nice.\"

\"Awfully nice\" was... not how Ryouko would have chosen to describe Joanne Valentin, but there was no point dispelling someone else\'s positive impression.

Patricia was a new member of this particular secret club, having been read into the secret when Azrael arrived at the station. Now, she was getting a far more visceral introduction than either of *them* had gotten.

\"This is astonishing,\" she said, rippling the back of her shirt with her newfound spinal thorns. \"I don\'t know of any simulation capable of taking bodymods this far. It feels so *natural*. In most sims, you have to piggyback the motor control onto some other muscles, but *this* is much cleaner. It still takes a bit of focus... how did you manage this?\"

Azrael\'s spinal thorns shuffled slightly from side‐to‐side, a gesture Ryouko now immediately recognized as nervous, though autonomically suppressed whenever the wings were attached.

\"I wish I could say this was my work, but I\'m neither a genius simulation developer nor neuroscientist,\" Azrael said. \"I built some of this world myself, based on bits and pieces I remember, but most of it, including the bodymods, was loaded onto our implants and stayed with me when I left the colony. Old software, stuff my, uh, ancestors had built to train themselves for their future bodies, before anyone was born with it. From what I know, there\'s software modules that act like small extensions of the brain, in place of motor circuits you don\'t actually have. It\'s in the manual.\"

\"Research into this kind of thing is basically outlawed,\" Patricia said, looking up at the wings mounted on wall racks. \"Not quite, but it doesn\'t get any resources, and people are always encouraged to work on something else. So the rumors say.\"

\"I know,\" Azrael said.

\"Can we, uh...\" Asami began, gesturing meekly at the wings herself. "I want to test it out.\"

\"Of course,\" Azrael said. \"That\'s the whole point of me inviting you to do this. Since it\'s your first time, I\'ll...\"

Her voice trailed off, and she looked away for a moment, almost as if she had thought of something.

\"I\'ll have to help you put them on,\" she finished a moment later.

She reached up at the wall rack, and one the wings helpfully slid forward to allow her to grab it. In that period of time, Ryouko and Asami figured out what was bothering her.

\"Oh, you don\'t have to,\" Asami said hurriedly. \"I\'m sure we can just have the simulation move them to our backs.\"

\"That seems rather boring,\" Patricia said, missing the point entirely. "If you don\'t mind, I\'d be happy to have them installed manually. The procedure must be---\"

She made a face as she received the telepathic equivalent of shouting.

\"Never mind,\" she amended a few seconds later, looking away awkwardly. "I\'m sure it\'s not that exciting. We\'re all ready to get going with the flights, right?\"

Azrael stood still for a moment, still holding a single white wing in both hands.

\"Yeah, let\'s skip that,\" she said, placing it back on the wall rack. "It\'ll save time anyway.\"

She smiled a little, facing the wall.

\"I can\'t say I wouldn\'t have enjoyed it, but it would have been... kind of creepy. It was normally something only parents did with their children. I\'ll have the simulation load the wings in directly, then.\"

Ryouko felt a momentary tingle on her back, then a sudden *weight*. Not a burden, like a backpack, but something paradoxically relaxing. Her shoulders felt lighter, her balance surer, even her backside more solid, somehow, and she realized that this was how it was *supposed* to be.

Then the sensory link‐ups came online, and she became conscious of the wings and tail, and she just didn\'t *think*. Her internal narrative was silent, because she had no time to focus on it.

\"I wouldn\'t know how to describe it,\" Patricia said, shaking her head and folding her wings in front of her so she could stroke them with one hand. \"Standard isn\'t meant to describe gaining extra limbs. The closest analogy I can think of is when they first install the ocular implants, and you can see all those new colors. We have names for some of those colors, but no names for this.\"

\"That\'s not entirely true,\" Azrael said, turning towards them. \"AIs have always had a term, which my colony borrowed. They call it 'Cognitive Expansion\', or \'Horizon Expansion\', since it feels like your mind is expanding. It\'s used for adding new sensory modalities, modules, or processing power.\"

Her expression was unreadable. Ryouko thought she looked amused, but it was overlaid with something else. Happiness?

\"Alright, so I don\'t have time to really take you through all the paces,\" Azrael continued. \"Usually, our children spent a lot of time practicing in special training areas before flying out in the open, but that takes a while, and it\'s not like I\'m *actually* trying to train you to fly. Even with natural instincts, it still takes a while to pick it all up, but I can have the simulation deal with that. Just follow me off the edge when we step outside.\"

*It actually sounds kind of terrifying when she puts it that way,* Asami thought.

Azrael strode towards the doorway, folding her wings behind her to slip through the opening.

There was enough space outside for the four of them to stand comfortably, and one by one they stepped outside, slowed, and stopped near the edge, looking over the former colony in front of them.

It was much larger and denser than Ryouko remembered depicted on the hologram in Azrael\'s room. Spires seemed to fill the sky around them, mingling with the clouds---you couldn\'t even see the tops of most of them, hidden in the murky distance, obscured by the dense atmosphere. The architecture was exotic, resembling nothing Ryouko had ever seen, save perhaps the mesas on San Giuseppe.

And between them moved swarms of *people*.

Most moved in orderly procession, traversing the sky from spire to spire, or top to bottom, in lazy soaring and controlled dives that seemed almost choreographed, obeying the markings and signals of billowing, stationary buoys. Others, farther from the spires, flew more freely, darting back and forth on obvious pleasure excursions. The coloration of wings and tails showed a raucous diversity, some tails even decorated with light ornaments, and one could spot the occasional pair of fliers engaged in tenuous, spiraling dances.

\"I can never make up my mind whether to have the people here when I visit,\" Azrael said. \"On the one hand, having them here reminds me, too much, of home. On the other hand, having it all empty is just... unpleasant.\"

There was almost too much to look at, even beyond the people and the colorful wings. Dirigibles and aircraft of every size shared the air lanes with the fliers, drones weaving nimbly back and forth, large transport craft floating in from somewhere far in the distance.

\"Who designed the spires?\" Asami asked, looking out at the floating structures. They seemed to fluctuate between giant mesa, oversized insect nest, and renaissance tower before their very eyes, the shifting clouds concealing and revealing features in real time.

\"The best answer is the scientists who originally designed the colony,\" Azrael said. \"They wanted to make an aerial structure that we could live in, something organic, with nothing in common with previous human architectural traditions. They didn\'t entirely get their way, though, since not everyone was on board with cutting ties like that. So, as a compromise, some crenellations were installed, so they would kind of resemble towers in the mist? It was a mess and our school material wasn\'t really that detailed.\"

\"It\'s really pretty though, in its own way,\" Patricia said.

\"That it is,\" Azrael said, stretching her wings out as she gazed at said towers, closing her nictating membranes against the sun, which was breaking its way over the towers at that very moment. The timing was obviously unnatural, driven by the simulation, but it was breathtaking nonetheless.

\"If you feel scared, remember that this is only a simulation,\" she said, turning to face them, wings spread. \"And remember that the simulation will not let you fail. Follow me.\"

Then she pushed herself off the edge, tipping backwards headfirst and allowing herself to fall, a winged silhouette against the sun.

\"Well, I hope she doesn\'t mind that I took a video of that,\" Asami said. \"She obviously enjoyed it.\"

Azrael soared back in front of them, dozens of meters away, watching as they peered skeptically over the edge.

Ryouko found herself staring down into what seemed like a measureless void, cascading clouds forming a solid wall that dipped down into infinity. It was daunting, even as Clarisse whispered to her that the simulation was dampening her fear response.

Before she was finished looking, though, Asami had vaulted off the edge, taking a running jump without even looking down, which was probably the right thing to do. Ryouko remembered, then, that Asami had fought in the depths of space, and limitless voids were merely a fact of life.

She watched Asami dive downwards, wings catching on air and bringing her slowly, inexorably to a stall, before a few powerful flaps sent her climbing back up.

Ryouko swallowed sharply, took a breath, and jumped, defying her muted, human instincts. She had been in freefall plenty of times before, after all, relying on her teleportation to keep her from hitting the ground. Here it provided solace.

Her nictating membranes closed instinctively, shielding her eyes from the onrush of air. The faint yellow pallor it placed on the world dropped immediately out of perception, as clouds rushed past her with dizzying speed.

She felt her wings stretching out, the air itself seeming to catch her like... a pillow, perhaps. Analogies failed her.

*This is* amazing, Patricia thought, appearing at Ryouko\'s side as they flew forward. She was stating the obvious, but something had to be said, and it obviously wasn\'t a good idea to yell at each other with the air roaring in their ears.

They pulled to a stop near Azrael and Asami, who were doing large, sweeping circles in the air---more precisely, they tried to stop, but Ryouko was finding that the slower she tried to move, the harder she had to beat her wings, and the wind was ever‐insistent, pulling her forward in a way that seemed to suggest, not so gently, where she wanted to go.

*This is nice, isn\'t it?* Azrael thought, her tone almost embarrassed. There\'s nothing quite like it. You\'re better off following the wind, by the way---most of it is artificial, it\'s how we maintained the skylanes. Maybe someday I\'ll take you offlane, but this is alright for now.*

She didn\'t wait for a response, not letting them get a word in edgewise. Instead, she turned and dove into an air current, and Asami followed a moment later, almost frantically.

The world turned again into a kaleidoscope of sky and cloud, wind and vapor swirling all around as Ryouko tried to follow Azrael\'s turn, using a dive to gain speed and catch the wind. She could barely keep Asami\'s tail feathers in view, but it wasn\'t disorienting, far from it. Her wings and proprioception helped her far more than her eyes, so that even in the most difficult turns she always knew which way was up.

She realized quickly that they were getting closer to the towers they had seen before, and began to grasp the organization of the city. Where they had been was sparse, closer to the outskirts. Where they were going was denser. Even here, the idea of a city was the same.

Something iridescent passed by her, another flier, and then Azrael pulled them into a slight bank, Ryouko\'s wings tugging slightly at her shoulders as she followed. Before she knew it, they were surrounded by other fliers, in a raucous collection of color, and in a miracle of synchronized flying they appeared to hover almost in place, the whole group following what she realized was a lead drone craft, there to slice the air and let them fly more smoothly in its wake.

It wasn\'t difficult---no harder than walking---in the thick, comforting air, and she remembered that Azrael needed powered assistance in the thinner atmospheres of most colonized worlds. It had to feel terrible.

She thought about asking where they were going, but decided against it. This was Azrael\'s show, and it was better to see where she was taking them than to ask questions. They were clearly going to be there soon.

Finally she felt the wind calm, and she saw Azrael slow, so she let her own momentum stall, curving her wings so that they would push her back, just a little. It felt so natural she hardly thought about it, and it was similarly easy to allow herself to fall, gently, using her tail to maneuver herself down a static column of air to their landing pad, which jutted out from one of the smaller towers.

\"The designers of this colony were geniuses,\" Patricia said, stepping towards Azrael with breathless enthusiasm. \"Geniuses. When I think about the things they could have done on Earth---\"

\"What Governance didn\'t *let* them do on Earth, you mean,\" Azrael said, raising one hand. \"They didn\'t even ask for anything like this. Just some basic augments. Just some science.\"

She stopped, reading the look on Patricia\'s face and realizing she had gotten carried away.

\"I\'m sorry. That has nothing to do with you,\" she said. \"It\'s a touchy topic for me.\"

She turned away from the group, gazing up at the spire above them, and the others followed her gaze. From here, they could see shops, residences, and even perhaps a museum, bright signs etched or stenciled onto the side of landing pads. To Ryouko it was even oddly familiar---there wasn\'t terribly much difference in principle between this spire and one of Mitakihara\'s tallest skyscrapers, themselves decorated with entranceways on numerous floors.

But where were they?

\"Come on,\" Azrael said, startling them from their reveries. \"I have a surprise for you.\"

She gestured with one hand, tucking her wings behind her back, and strode forward into the opening in front of them, which resembled a cave mouth, if caves had glass sliding doors.

It took Ryouko only a moment to recognize that they had stepped into the entrance to some kind of commercial area, pleading holographic advertisements on the walls still tacky to an Earther.

Ryouko\'s nictating membranes slid open a moment later, and she blinked, feeling the cool air on her eyes.

\"The simulation that came loaded with my implants didn\'t have any of this,\" Azrael said, raising her arms up as she stepped through another doorway. \"The walls and the caverns, yes, but not the decorations, or what was on sale, or any of the fine details. The designers spent most of their effort on the biology simulation and the wings, quite understandably. They didn\'t have any idea what the culture would be like, or what we would sell. I think they were content to let us find out for ourselves. On the other hand, I just have to use my memories.\"

The others looked around in silence as they followed her into the next chamber, or rather next *cavern*, a vast open area with a ceiling that stretched upward nearly to a vanishing point, the walls a brownish‐tan suggestive of rock, lit by invisible lights.

Shops and residences lined those walls, or were mounted on tenuous‐looking platforms in the middle, stacked upon one another like impossibly tall towers of toy blocks. Almost all of them opened directly to the air, no allowance made whatsoever to the possibility that someone might try to walk up to one.

And all of it, every terrace and platform and shop, was empty. Here, at least, Azrael had chosen not to meet anyone.

\"Now it\'s my monument to my people,\" Azrael said, turning towards them. \"Besides my therapists, you\'re the only people to have ever seen this.\"

\"They don\'t usually encourage this kind of time spent building a simulation, if you don\'t mind my saying so,\" Patricia said, gaze upward.

\"I never had any intention of losing myself here, if that\'s what you\'re getting at,\" Azrael said. \"It was tempting, but I had a friend who helped support me, just a little. It made a big difference.\"

\"Yeah,\" Patricia agreed, after a small pause.

\"But we\'re not just here to stare,\" Azrael said. \"Come on, follow me.\"

Azrael turned and made a hand gesture, and the three of them started to follow---then froze in surprise when Azrael crouched and jumped inhumanly high, launching herself into the air with long, powerful wing‐beats.

*I was expecting her to just walk,* Ryouko thought to Clarisse. *This is going to take some getting used to.*

*I wonder if she meant Homura,* Clarisse thought, with the air of a passing thought.

*What?*

*The friend who supported Azrael,* Clarisse thought. *I don\'t know who else it could be.*

*Maybe,* Ryouko thought, propelling herself into the air in the same manner as Azrael had. She, too, pushed herself into the air with more speed than should have been humanly possible. It could have been merely her magical girl strength, but she had the sense there was more to it than that.

They flew in silence for a while, as Ryouko thought to herself about whether a colony like this might install catapults to launch people into the air more conveniently, and when she landed on their destination, she realized she hadn\'t paid attention to the flying at all.

Azrael stood grinning next to a florally‐decorated sign, labeled "Selene\'s Premium Wing and Tail Decorations\". This was followed by a depiction of a heart and winged cupid.

\"I\'m not sure I like where this is going,\" Patricia said, peering at the sign.

\"I added this place just for you all,\" she said. \"I hadn\'t bothered, previously. Too many memories.\"

She turned and looked at the colorful feathers that festooned the doorway.

\"We had a bit of a tradition back in the colony, where courting couples would buy ornaments to decorate themselves with, then go on these elaborate flights to declare their love. It was a total community thing, and people would turn out to watch it. Being able to fly like that was proof you were an adult, and ready for the other stuff. That was the idea.\"

She stroked one of the feathers.

\"When I was young, when this colony still existed, there was a boy I had a crush on, who had been my friend since I was young. I drove myself crazy trying to decide how to tell him, and I ended up coming here to buy myself a bunch of \'color\', as we used to call it. I was so happy, and even my sister loved it.\"

She shook her head.

\"But you can guess this didn\'t end well. It turned out he was already taken, and before I could get over it, we had the disaster. I\'m not even sure what happened to him, but I know he wasn\'t one of the few rescued by Governance.\"

\"I\'m sorry,\" Asami said, uncertainly, because it wasn\'t obvious what the right sentiment was.

\"Yeah,\" Azrael acknowledged, wings drooping. \"One of the things that really ate me later was, when I made my wish, why didn\'t I just wish the colony back? I like to think I just didn\'t think of it, since everything was so crazy, but sometimes I wonder.\"

\"You can\'t beat yourself up about that,\" Patricia said. \"It\'s not possible to optimize wishes.\"

\"I know,\" Azrael said. \"Or at least I know now. But you can see why I wasn\'t in any rush to relive my memories of this place just to complete this simulation.\"

\"But!\" she said, turning dramatically to make her point. \"I\'m not just here to reminisce dramatically. I\'m here to try to put some demons to rest. How would the two of you like to try buying some ornaments?\"

It took Ryouko a few seconds to realize who Azrael meant.

\"Really?\" she asked, unsure what else to say. \"I\'m not sure I\'m uh, ready for that. We only just got here.\"

\"That sounds *romantic*,\" Asami said, as Ryouko knew she would. Asami even gave her a sly look on the side.

\"No, no flying today,\" Azrael said, waving her hands. \"Even with the simulation to assist, I wouldn\'t want to do it today. Just the ornaments, though. It\'ll be fun!\"

\"Alright, then,\" Ryouko said, smiling vaguely, even as Asami looked disappointed. Ornaments she could deal with.

They followed Azrael into the shop, Ryouko pausing to take a look at the oddly‐shaped bells that clanked when they pushed open the door. She wasn\'t sure if it was intended to be nostalgically old‐fashioned, or if this particular colony just didn\'t have as much tech to spare on little things.

\"Welcome,\" the shopkeeper said, stepping around the counter to greet them. It seemed Azrael had loaded at least one personality into the simulation.

\"Uh, hello,\" Ryouko said politely, as Azrael walked over and did some kind of wing gesture, presumably of greeting. The shopkeeper wasn\'t wearing *her* wings, keeping her back concealed under a stylish‐looking blouse. That was probably wise, given that there wouldn\'t have been space to move or even stand behind the counter with wings on.

With that in mind, she looked at Azrael, who nodded, her wings unclasping themselves and tilting forward so she could grab them and hang them on convenient hooks set into the wall. Ryouko couldn\'t help but notice that her clothing wrapped itself around the connection point even as this happened, concealing any kind of direct view.

Ryouko frowned, focusing her thoughts on her own wings which, like so many other thought‐controlled mechanisms, responded immediately, sending an oddly unpleasant sensation through her, accompanied by a slight nausea.

Until then, she hadn\'t realized just how used she had gotten to the effective extra limbs on her back. Without them, the world felt disorienting, and smaller.

*Interesting to think how it\'s not even human to have wings,* Clarisse thought. *And yet it felt so normal. You didn\'t go around thinking to yourself how alien you felt.*

Ryouko nodded slightly in agreement.

\"It\'s always like that, but you get used to it,\" Azrael said, watching Asami and Patricia grimace as Ryouko had. \"It\'s not a physiological thing---it\'s just fundamentally not pleasant to lose functionality. The AIs will tell you all about it, if you ask. The bigger shops have space for you to keep your wings on, but that costs more rent. More humble shops have to be tight.\"

The shopkeeper should have questioned their odd inexperience, but ignored it, instead gesturing at her selection.

\"I might not have the fanciest shop or the most wing‐space, but I *do have the finest selection,\" she said. \"All handcrafted, perfect for weddings, ceremonies, parties, and, of course, the *dance*.\"

She smiled knowingly, her eyes resting on Ryouko and Asami in particular as she studied the group.

\"But don\'t worry, there\'s plenty of space in the back for you to try things on, *with* wings attached. That\'s a necessity.\"

Ryouko smiled nervously, even though the vendor hadn\'t spoken directly to her. It felt odd, being seen as merely one half of a romantic pairing.

Asami walked over to a display case, boldly grabbing what looked like an assortment of bone hooks hung on a large metal loop.

\"This seems interesting,\" Asami said, as Ryouko leaned over to take a look.

They felt the material. It seemed like bone, but the texture felt just a little off. And had Azrael\'s homeworld even had native life?

\"I guess they probably *did* have some kind of ecosystem,\" Asami said, "or there wouldn\'t have been any oxygen to breathe, most likely. It\'s hard to imagine what would have evolved on a planet like this, though. I thought the surface was uninhabitable.\"

Ryouko made a noise of agreement, not noticing that they had followed each other\'s thoughts.

\"I\'m sure the ecosystem would be fascinating for you,\" Azrael said, appearing next to them. \"Rather than talk about it, I think I\'d rather just show you. Later, though.\"

Ryouko nodded, though she had honestly been looking forward to Asami\'s inevitable excitement for the topic of alien life. The conversations got a bit long, but there was just something about seeing her enjoy herself so much.

\"I\'m not even sure how to picture myself wearing any of this stuff,\" Asami said, trying to tilt her head to look behind her. \"I\'m not used to having a tail.\"

\"We can go in the back later,\" Azrael said. \"I\'m sure they\'ll have a cosmetic mirror.\"

Ryouko tuned them out, holding up a small... ring, examining it for a long moment. It was too large to be intended for a finger, but that wasn\'t really what she was interested in. Something about it looked oddly familiar, as if she had seen it before.

Shaking her head, she queried her electronic memories.

*It\'s a coincidence, I\'m sure,* Clarisse thought. *I didn\'t think it worth pointing out. A helix isn\'t exactly an unheard‐of motif, though I don\'t know exactly why Simona gave you one of those. Reanalyzing your interactions with her hasn\'t yielded much that\'s new...*

*Maybe meaningful somehow,* Ryouko thought.

She hadn\'t worn the ring Simona had given her for long, partially because it was awkward in combat and partially because it just seemed a little garish. Instead, she had put it in her box of keepsakes, along with a few other gifts she had gotten. Unlike some of the other pieces of jewelry she had, it didn\'t get her any special matriarchy benefits, so she hadn\'t really kept it in mind.

\"Oh yeah, that one is meant to be hooked into a feather on certain wing models,\" Azrael said, guessing at her question. \"The, uh, DNA design was always popular, given our origins.\"

\"Oh that\'s a weird one,\" Asami said, taking it to look at. \"It\'s like the ring you were wearing back at the starport, when we first left Earth. I\'ve always wondered about that.\"

She gave Ryouko the kind of look that meant she really did want an answer to the implied question.

\"It was a gift from Simona, the, uh, girl who arrived earlier. My friends were giving me gifts for my departure.\"

\"Her?\" Asami asked, clearly not pleased.

\"What\'s her deal anyway?\" Azrael asked. \"They never really explained it to me. She was related to the wormhole stuff somehow, apparently? But she\'s also your school friend.\"

Ryouko looked away, rubbing her hands nervously.

\"Well, that\'s my question too,\" Ryouko said. \"It\'s more coincidental than makes sense, and I have reasons to believe there are more coincidences on top of that. I don\'t know what\'s up with her either. I kind of wonder...\"

She let her voice trail off there, because she didn\'t know how to explain it. How was she supposed to explain that Simona seemed to be part of yet another conspiracy? That Clarisse van Rossum herself had been stonewalled when she investigated? That what little Ryouko had deciphered---that Simona might have been born in a vat, that Simona might have moved to Japan just to find her---came from the Goddess, in hints sprinkled across a vision? That on top of all that Simona was apparently in love with her? It would have been painful to explain in an intimate two‐person conversation, much less here, in the open, while shopping for ornaments.

\"Well, she\'s quite taken with you, I think,\" Azrael said, shrugging. "If I didn\'t think it was too crazy, I might have guessed that\'s what all this was about.\"

\"Does *everyone* know that?\" Ryouko exclaimed, exasperated, turning to glare at Azrael, before directing her gaze at the others. \"Did you all know that?\"

\"I thought it might be the case,\" Asami said, making a shrugging gesture. \"I was going to ask you about it at some point.\"

\"I wasn\'t really paying attention, to be honest,\" Patricia said, looking surprised at the vehemence of Ryouko\'s reaction. \"So I don\'t have anything to say in particular.\"

\"Sorry, sorry, I thought you knew,\" Azrael said, maybe a gesture of contrition.

Asami put a hand on Ryouko\'s shoulder.

\"Sorry,\" Ryouko said. \"I was just surprised. It frustrates me. I\'m not used to this kind of thing.\"

Azrael cast a glance at the shop owner, then at Ryouko.

\"Well, I apologize. I forget sometimes how young you really all are. I gave you adult bodies, for improved flight.\"

She shuffled side to side for a moment.

\"Well, let\'s buy a few more ornaments, and then we can talk about it. I was going to take you all to my favorite local place, just to eat. We can chat.\"

\"It\'s complicated,\" Ryouko said, embarrassed now.

\"Everyone thinks that,\" Patricia said.

She held up a chain that shimmered green, changing the topic.

\"Come on, I think this emerald piece is really charming. It\'s uh---I have no idea what this is for.\"

\"It\'s just a necklace, Patricia,\" Azrael said.

Ryouko shook her head in exasperation.

*It really* is *complicated,* Clarisse thought. *It\'s not just your imagination. They just don\'t know all the details.*

*How am I going to explain any of this without explaining the other stuff, though?* Ryouko thought.

*You could just explain it, I think,* Clarisse thought. *They both know about your brain and your connection to the Goddess. There\'s not really too much more to cover.*

Ryouko\'s eyes widened slightly, even as Asami put the necklace around her neck.

*That\'s a good point,* she thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"This seems unsafe,\" Patricia said, peering skeptically over the side of their bench, which was a sheer drop into... well, nothing.

\"There\'s a net,\" Azrael said, shrugging her shoulders so that her wings followed suit. \"I told you, space was always very tight inside the towers, and it was always very expensive to rent or buy. But out here*, off the lanes...\"

She gestured with one hand at the open air around them.

\"Well, rent is free,\" she said. \"As long as you can stay in the air.\"

More normal humans might have been terrified at their current predicament, seated on a rickety narrow bench over a sheer drop to the planet below, barely attached to what looked like a restaurant strapped to a balloon---to what *was* a restaurant strapped to a balloon. But all of them were magical girls, and had fallen out of the sky plenty of times both in and out of simulation, or even in the depths of space. Safety was relative.

\"Order up!\" the human server yelled, placing in front of them something that looked like small, tubular, *green* shellfish, grilled in garlic and served with a side of fries. Azrael had explained to them that a lot of the food on the colony was grown in huge hydroponics facilities, which made the presence of Earth foods like garlic and potatoes understandable. But shellfish?

\"So you asked about Terra Roja\'s ecosystem before,\" Azrael said, looking at Asami.

\"These are balloon barnacles, which are called that because they stick and grow on the side of anything in the air. They\'re a huge nuisance sometimes, and you have to clean them off your wings, but hey, at least they\'re tasty. In the wild, they latch onto the side of these sort of giant, gas‐filled, photosynthetic sacs. They\'re kind of like parasites.\"

\"They also look like goose barnacles,\" Asami said, squinting at one.

\"That\'s a coincidence,\" Azrael said.

Ryouko nibbled on one, finding it juicy, garlicky, umami, and, well, generally delicious. She devoured three more quickly, and found herself wondering what they tasted like raw.

\"So let\'s talk about Simona del Mago,\" Azrael said, leaning back and opening her wings slightly in the air.

Ryouko grimaced, even as she sucked on a shell. She had transmitted the basics of the situation over to them while they flew, taking advantage of the opportunity to avoid an unpleasant social interaction. But she hadn\'t yet heard what they had to say about it.

\"From a purely statistical point of view, this is a situation you are hardly alone in,\" Patricia said, in the midst of inhaling a batch of fries. \"Having someone crushing on you, or \'in love\' with you, when you\'re already committed, is a very common situation. Fundamentally, unless you and Asami are open to having a more polyamorous relationship---and most people are not---there\'s just nothing you should feel bad about. Simona might even realize that, since she hasn\'t tried to say anything to you since you left Earth.\"

She spoke didactically, as if she were quoting something.

\"Well, I\'ve figured *that* out,\" Ryouko said, a bit peeved. \"I could just read the online guides, but I have a suspicion they\'re not very good at dealing with the situation where she\'s also part of a super‐secret conspiracy that has access to beyond‐Governance technology and might have been stalking me since before I knew her. And for the record, no, I\'m not interested in a polyamorous relationship; I find one hard to manage already.\"

\"Yeah, that\'s the wrinkle,\" Patricia said, surprised by her level of emotion. \"Um, I was getting to that.\"

She cleared her throat, awkwardly dropping a half‐eaten barnacle back into her plate.

\"I think you should try to treat the romance and the conspiracy as two completely different subjects,\" she said. \"Just get a clean separation between the two parts of the problem, so you can solve them separately. It\'s likely they have nothing to do with each other, and whatever thing she has for you is probably getting in the way of whatever she\'s supposed to be doing.\"

\"That makes sense to me,\" Azrael said, continuing to eat. \"Of course, that might rely on Simona being mature about all this. Part of being an adult is being able to separate aspects of your life that have nothing to do with each other. Personal and professional, so to speak. I\'m attracted to you girls, because of my, uh, genetic programming to like smaller humans like in my colony, but I don\'t let it get in the way of my work. Or this.\"

Patricia blinked, clearly kind of shocked by the statement, and Ryouko had the sense Azrael was faking her nonchalance.

\"Anyway,\" Azrael added, unable to hide an awkward blush. \"I think Simona might be trying to do that too. After all, if she\'s working for some super‐secret conspiracy, she\'s probably competent. Though that makes me realize that she\'s probably not really a teenager...\"

\"She has to be, if she just contracted,\" Patricia pointed out.

\"Uh, right,\" Azrael agreed, and Ryouko caught Asami smirking. Azrael was not exactly being perfectly smooth.

Ryouko shook her head at the ongoing conversation.

\"I can agree with the general notion, but one of my concerns at the moment is that I\'m only sure I can trust her *because* she has a thing for me. If I make her unhappy, then she becomes dangerous instead.\"

*That* argument was actually from her TacComp, since she hadn\'t really had time to think through the implications to that extent. Or, more honestly, she had been avoiding really thinking about it.

\"Well, we didn\'t say you had to go confront her or explicitly turn her down,\" Patricia said. \"Actually, if we examine your situation in isolation, the most reasonable thing seems to be doing nothing. She hasn\'t tried to hit on you or anything, and she seems okay just lurking in the background. If that\'s the way it is, there\'s no reason to cause drama.\"

\"That sounds dissatisfying,\" Asami said, shaking her head. Patricia gave her an odd look.

\"Some things in life are like that,\" Patricia said, shrugging. \"So I\'m told, anyway. I haven\'t lived long enough for a couple of years to seem like no big deal, but it\'s supposed to happen eventually. And more practically, you\'re not going to be on this space station forever, so you won\'t see her forever either.\"

\"Well, I can definitely do *nothing*, if that\'s your advice,\" Ryouko said, taking a gulp of the fizzy drink the restaurant had provided them with. \"That\'s easy. But now there\'s also all this other stuff, these conspiracies, and people trying to push me around, and this thing that\'s in my head. Simona\'s just a part of that, but it\'s all just gotten to be too much for me, you know? I think---\"

She stopped, considering carefully what she was about to say. Everyone here knew about the thing in her head, and that included the AI that was helping run this sim, but it still worried her to say what she and her TacComp had spent so long talking about.

\"I think she has something to do with the thing that\'s in my head, and all this weird genetic stuff. I told you about my vision---it only stands to reason. If they knew about it, it\'d make sense to have someone follow me around, someone to try and be friends with me. And there\'s the matter of what exactly her wish was. Every magical girl has a wish.\"

\"That would make a certain amount of sense,\" Patricia said, closing her eyes for a moment. \"Do you want to just confront her?\"

Ryouko blinked, surprised by the notion, which she had already discarded.

\"Confront her? Here?\" she asked. \"That\'d be risky.\"

\"Not *too* risky, if we help you do it,\" Patricia said. \"Though being on a space station has its pluses and minuses. On the upside, she has nowhere to run to. On the downside, if she tries to do something crazy, it could be really bad. But I don\'t think she\'s likely to do anything that crazy.\"

\"If we really needed it, I have experience with space anyway,\" Asami said.

\"I\'d be willing to help,\" Azrael said. \"I\'ve confronted plenty of magical girls in my life.\"

\"I\'d have to think about it a little, I don\'t know,\" Ryouko said, a bit hastily, to try to stall what seemed like a growing consensus. She was being truthful, too---she\'d have to think about it and consult with both Clarisses, since she hadn\'t previously anticipated being able to go in with Patricia and Azrael as well. It just wasn\'t an encounter she welcomed, in any form.

\"Fair enough,\" Azrael said, shrugging. \"I\'m not really sure what else we can say on that topic. It\'s unlikely we could give advice or pursue sources better than Clarisse van Rossum.\"

\"Yeah, I was afraid of that, honestly,\" Ryouko said.

She started to eat another barnacle, but stopped, overcome by a sense of... not quite unease, but almost *déjà vu*.

She looked up at the awning that stretched above their seats, an almost artistic arrangement of fabric that flowed like streamers in the wind, from one end to the other, like standing waves.

A holding pattern. That\'s what she had said she was in, when asked about her life on this space station. But here she was, deferring a decision that might break her out of it. She had said she didn\'t have enough information, and she didn\'t, but that wasn\'t the real reason. She knew quite well what ultimately had to happen, information or not. She was just waiting, stalling, until there was no decision left to make.

She had to get used to taking chances. Force her own terms of engagement, like she did so easily in combat. Ever since she had made a wish to make something of herself, she had waited for the sky to open up and drop what she wanted upon her. Her wish was just doing what she had asked. If she wanted to have some input on where she was going, she needed to take some action herself, instead of letting things be dictated to her.

It was just... difficult.

*I can\'t say I disagree,* Clarisse commented.

\"You know, we should just do it,\" Ryouko said, leaning forward to look down the row of wings and faces next to her. \"That\'s the only way to make any kind of progress, right? I don\'t know that sitting on it will make any real difference. We just need to come up with a plan for how to do it. I\'m not sure charging straight into her room is the optimal approach.\"

Azrael raised an eyebrow, glancing at Asami, who looked surprised, perhaps pleasantly.

\"Also fair enough,\" she said. \"I might suggest talking to Vlad and Van Rossum first, then. They might have some other insights into the question, and they already know all they need to know.\"

\"I could try having a drone spy on her for a while,\" Patricia said. "I\'m not sure what I could find that Vlad wouldn\'t be able to pull from his surveillance, but we can\'t just assume he\'d help us. And if she spots the drone---well, we were going to confront her anyway.\"

\"That seems reasonable,\" Ryouko said. \"If you don\'t mind helping me.\"

Patricia just smiled and shrugged, taking a sip of her drink.

\"Let\'s focus on eating,\" she said. \"I think we can take a break from all this, for now.\"

Ryouko was glad to enjoy the silence that followed, polishing off the rest of her barnacles with ruthless efficiency. They were quite good.

It was only when she was done, stretching her arms out above her head, that she remembered where she was, that she had a tail fanned out behind her, and that she was seated above a sheer drop to a crushing death. She had gotten used to everything, amazingly, and she twitched her wings self‐consciously.

She looked around. The others were also nearly done eating. Was it time to leave the sim?

Patricia caught her eye, then, and Ryouko turned to complete the eye contact.

\"I did, uh, want to say something more,\" Patricia said.

Ryouko tilted her head, uncertain how she should react.

\"I know you\'re worried about the thing in your head and what it is, what it might be doing to you, and what others might think of it, but you shouldn\'t let it eat at you. You\'re not as unique as you think. If I may...\"

She looked around, pausing on Asami and Azrael in turn, in a way that made clear they had talked about this beforehand.

Patricia sucked in a breath.

\"So, I know this isn\'t exactly the same as your situation, but it\'s a little analogous,\" Patricia said, tapping her fingers on the counter. "I was... the academic lowlight of my family. That\'s not an easy thing in the Von Rohrs. I made a wish to change that, and ever since... I\'ve always had to wonder about me. About whether these ideas in my head are even mine, about whether I\'m the same person I once was. I avoid my family, because I don\'t like being reminded how much better they treated me after I made my wish. I avoid my old friends and I... used to wonder who I even was.\"

The words came out flat, but measured, with occasional hesitation, and Patricia avoided making eye contact, until she turned towards Ryouko at the very end.

\"As you can see, it\'s not easy for me to talk about,\" she said. "Partly that\'s just a lack of practice. But I want to impress upon you that you are you, regardless of what else is going on, what brain parts you have, what Simona is up to, and what wishes may or may not have done. You have to live your life. That\'s what I learned, in the end.\"

\"And don\'t forget about my parents,\" Asami added. \"I... wouldn\'t say I\'ve gotten over that. But I\'ve at least learned not to let it eat at me when they\'re not around.\"

Ryouko looked between the other girls, realizing the point they were trying to make. None of them was free of worry, about who they were and what their lives were for. She wasn\'t alone.

\"Thank you,\" she said, because it seemed like the right thing to say. "I\'ll try to keep this in mind. Just keep an eye on me, alright?\"

\"I always do,\" Azrael said.

Before they could respond to the joke, more plates of food arrived, suspiciously timed.

\"Alright, so these may look like giant chicken wings,\" Azrael explained. \"But actually, this is basically a species of native bird...\"

Ryouko shook her head at the diversion, looking back at the awning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"So what is it?\" Mami asked, watching the reaction of Vladimir Volokhov, the rather pointedly‐named Director of Adept Blue.

\"We don\'t know,\" the AI said, shaking its head. \"But we do know that it shines like a beacon on our new sensors whenever we start a new experiment with our volunteers. The space‐time there is wrong somehow, too warped.\"

The avatar raised both its hands, summoning a hovering, misshapen orb, shaded by shifting primary colors.

\"This is a representation of what we\'ve been able to infer about the space‐time structure in the region. We shouldn\'t even be able to *see anything at this range, but the signals are quite clear. One of the theoreticians thinks that it is somehow much closer to us than it should be.\"

\"Should we be concerned?\" Mami asked.

\"I do not know,\" Volokhov said, dispelling the sphere and clasping his hands behind his back. \"We have theories. We know it does not resemble a nascent wormhole. It almost looks like an artificial black hole, but twisted*---we are still working on the hypergeometry. What we *can* say with certainty is that the activity there consumes enormous energy. As to the purpose: Constructing a weapon, perhaps? Or generating fuel. We will have to have Miss Nakihara run some more experiments for us.\"

\"The location of this anomaly overlaps directly with the pulsar facility in the latest survey,\" Anand said, looking at Mami from the corner of her eye. The AI, naturally, did not know about that survey.

\"Yes, a pulsar,\" Volokhov said, blinking. \"I took the liberty of consulting some astrogation charts after this discovery. There *is* a pulsar there, which surprised us, since it wasn\'t at all obvious in the sensor data. I\'ve already put in the request for a long‐range astronomical study of the emissions, to look for anomalies.\"

\"Should we send a probe?\" Anand asked.

\"Maybe, maybe not,\" Mami said, rubbing her eyes for a moment. \"At the moment, the facility appears nearly undefended. If we send something it might tip them off that we noticed them. Let\'s run some simulations.\"

She looked at Volokhov.

\"And continue your long‐range studies.\"

\"Of course,\" the AI said.

Mami looked at the others for a moment.

\"That was it,\" Anand said. \"I just wanted to bring this to your attention.\"

\"Ah, sure,\" Mami said. \"If you don\'t mind, I need to talk to the Director about some other issues...\"

\"Of course,\" Anand said, catching the blatant hint. \"We\'ll meet up later.\"

She disappeared from the simulation, departure accentuated by a sparkle effect.

\"And how worried should we be about the source of these new sensors?\" Mami asked, looking the AI in the eye.

\"In this case, I developed them myself,\" he said. \"Taking advantage of the lab facilities and our new volunteers. They don\'t even operate without Miss Nakihara and Miss Shizuki acting as power sources. Our mysterious new visitor played no role in this.\"

\"I\'m glad to hear it. I don\'t like this game that is being played.\"

\"By this new faction?\" Volokhov asked, tilting his head questioningly. "Or by Miss Chitose?\"

\"Either. Both. I just don\'t like it,\" Mami said.

\"Understandable. I will be keeping an eye on her.\"

He looked at Mami a second longer, then, sensing he was no longer needed, disappeared as well.

Mami summoned the sensor data for herself, leaning back onto the conference table to stare at the orb.

*Maybe we should do a cross‐check of known pulsars and Cephalopod activity,* Machina thought. *If this isn\'t an experimental facility, it stands to reason that it\'s not the only one of its kind. We might learn something.*

*That\'s a good idea,* Mami thought. *Do it.*

She stared at the orb a moment longer. They had spent too long in this war waiting for the next Ceph move, too many years letting the squid dictate the terms of engagement. Erwynmark had always understood that, even in the long years after the Saharan Raid.

If whatever this was panned out, turned out to be useful, then they finally had a chance to act, even if only in a small way. If it panned out.

*Fuel,* she thought, *or a weapon.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simona del Mago was genuinely surprised to see them all at her door.

They could tell, because she made them wait before allowing her door to open, and when the door did open they could see the cleaning drones behind her still putting away the remnants of a meal.

\"Well, this is unexpected,\" Simona said, glancing around quickly. "What\'s the occasion?\"

Ryouko felt Simona\'s gaze drift towards her, and stay there.

Ryouko couldn\'t help but feel uncomfortable, even if she had instigated this. She had hoped it wouldn\'t be necessary, and they\'d gone through their options. They had tried Patricia\'s drone idea, with Vlad\'s grudging approval, but had yet to find anything other than what Vlad had told them---she spent her time on the station living an almost boring existence, oscillating between eating, reading, and time on the entertainment console.

They could have waited a bit longer, but she hadn\'t thought it was likely to be worth anything. About the only thing they might have done differently was ask Clarisse van Rossum to join them, but she didn\'t think she wanted that---Clarisse had already been cagey about the topic when she had tried to ask her before this meeting.

So here they were.

\"We just wanted to ask you a few questions,\" Azrael began, since she was the most experienced. \"You don\'t mind if we step inside?\"

\"Of course not,\" Simona said, though it was written on her face that she didn\'t relish the idea. \"I\'ll have the drones set out some snacks.\"

They filed into the room uncertainly, Simona pretending to fuss over the presentation of her sitting room table. Eri and Elanis stayed outside flanking the door, both as a visible indication of their guard duties and as a small show of force.

Eventually they sat, and there was nothing else to stall over.

\"Alright, so you don\'t have to tell me what this is about,\" Simona said, before any of them could say anything. \"I\'ve had this coming ever since I got here.\"

She sucked in a breath, visibly unnerved and clasping her hands. She no longer stared at Ryouko.

\"Where to start... the group I work for predicted a long time ago that we would be here, working on a wormhole device. It was predicted that I needed to come here, to bring certain theoretical derivations to the lab that were necessary to understand wormhole instabilities, to prevent disaster. The success of the recent experiments was based partially on what I brought here.\"

There was no way to absorb information like that readily, and they just sat there blinking for a long while, occasionally making false starts at sentences.

\"*Group?* Predicted? How?\" Patricia finally managed.

\"I don\'t know,\" Simona said. \"Whoever I\'m working for claims to work for Governance, but in a way Governance itself is unaware of. And as for how they make predictions, I have no idea, but I have seen them to be right far more often than not, and I\'m not sure they weren\'t lying to me when they did appear to be wrong. I don\'t have all the answers, you see. They didn\'t tell me you\'d be here, for example.\"

\"Who are you?\" Ryouko demanded. \"Why did you come to me?\"

Simona looked distinctly unhappy with her situation.

\"I know what you must think of me,\" she said, \"but not everything is a lie. I am a teenager, I am recently contracted. I am really your friend. I was... sent to watch over you, I was told you were important. I was never told much else.\"

\"Unacceptable,\" Azrael said, leaning forward with an aura of menace that seemed out of sync with her stature. \"You\'re holding back. We\'re going to be asking questions all day if you keep leaving out so much.\"

\"Do you know how betrayed I feel?\" Ryouko said, gritting her teeth slightly. \"I trusted you. I thought you were my friend. My friends and I took you, because we wanted to take care of the lonely‐looking exchange student. I thought we were being *nice*.\"

Simona looked shocked for a moment, then torn, biting her lips.

\"I don\'t... I didn\'t think it was that important,\" she said. "Everyone has their secrets, and it\'s not like I wanted to hurt you. I just wanted to be your friend.\"

\"You were *told* to be my friend.\"

\"It was more than that! I mean, at the beginning, yes, but I was given a file to read, and reading it made me think...\"

Her voice trailed off there, as she was clearly struggling to continue the thought.

\"What? Think what?\" Ryouko half‐asked, half‐demanded.

\"That you, and your friends, could be someone I could truly get to know. Ever since I was a kid I\'ve never...\"

Simona closed her eyes and clenched her lips, visibly hurting, and Ryouko couldn\'t help feeling a twinge of sympathy. She had been her friend, after all.

\"I can\'t tell you everything, and I don\'t know everything, alright? I was a lab experiment, an early war project when things were desperate. I was raised as a normal child, but it turned out we were a test, in more ways than one. An experiment to see if magical girl contracting could be manipulated; more than that, a test of an alternate TCF implant set.\"

She shook her head, lost in her own narration for a moment.

\"After that, we didn\'t have any normal childhoods, any friends. We were signed on to the cause as agents. Embedded in key locations, a conspiracy by Governance against itself, if something were to ever go terribly wrong. You\'ll understand that I never saw keeping a secret as anything *unusual*.\"

She had shown a flash of anger, enough that Asami, who had been about to say something, held her peace.

\"You were used as *children*?\" Patricia asked, aghast.

\"Not quite,\" Simona said, with a voice that suggested she viewed the topic as a distraction. \"Our growth was accelerated, so really it was more like we were recruited as teenagers. And it\'s for a good cause, supposedly.\"

\"Were you ever going to tell me?\" Ryouko asked, shaking her head. She realized how ridiculous it was that she somehow cared about *that* more than she cared about the contents of what she had just heard.

\"I *was* going to tell you,\" Simona said, cringing. \"You remember, when we were attacked by demons on that embankment?\"

Ryouko looked away, making a small show of thinking about it when, really, she remembered right away. But the exact details... seemed distant now, a world away, just a backdrop to the one moment her life changed.

\"Yeah,\" she said, returning to Simona. \"You wanted to talk to me about something.\"

\"I was going to tell you the truth!\" Simona said, raising her hands in exasperation. \"Not all at once, but I was. Then all of *that* happened, and you made a contract, and I had Tomoe Mami, one of the highest‐ranking magical girls in existence, telling me to keep a lid on it, so I wouldn\'t distract you, so I did.\"

\"Hold on, *Mami‐san* knew about all this?\" Azrael asked.

\"No!\" Simona said, frustrated. \"Not---not *this*. Something else, but I got the point anyway. I kept my mouth shut until you were ready to hear it. Which was, apparently, today.\"

She grimaced, shaking her head ruefully.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said. \"Such is the nature of life, to have to apologize even when you didn\'t think you were doing anything wrong. I\'m sorry for keeping secrets.\"

Ryouko looked at the other girl, whose black hair drooped over her eyes, and could only think about how innocuous she looked. She didn\'t carry the aura of an Ancient, or even the merely old. She had no aura at all. She was one of them, as adrift on the currents of the world as they were. It was hard to really be angry at that.

\"I can\'t say I forgive you, but I will accept the apology,\" she said. "I don\'t know if that makes sense.\"

Simona nodded, slightly, then shrugged.

\"That\'s better than I\'d hoped,\" she said.

Patricia leaned forward, her hair twisting itself in a way that was almost menacing.

\"If you\'re not keeping any secrets, then I suppose you had nothing to do with the demons that attacked Ryouko before she made a contract?\"

Simona looked up, the surprise visible in her eyes.

\"Of course not. Were you listening? It interrupted *my* plans. Are you saying it wasn\'t a coincidence?\"

Patricia sighed.

\"No, it wasn\'t a coincidence. In fact, one of my guesses going into this meeting was that you had something to do with it.\"

Ryouko frowned. She had considered the notion, along with her TacComp, but she hadn\'t thought it very likely. Simply put, she doubted Simona would get the both of them nearly killed, with no recourse other than Mami literally passing through the area.

\"What do you know about Joanne Valentin?\" Ryouko asked, looking down at Simona.

\"Director Valentin?\" Simona asked. \"Not... *that* much. I barely know her. She *was* the point of contact the MSY used to get me here, which suggests to me she\'s trusted with quite a bit of sensitive knowledge. It\'s weird, but I feel like I meet her more than I should.\"

\"Yeah, that\'s my opinion too,\" Ryouko said, unable to keep some irony out of her voice. \"But, she was your point of contact?\"

Simona closed her eyes for a moment, leaning onto one arm.

\"In the interests of sharing,\" she said. \"Allow me to explain what I\'ve been up to since I\'ve been gone. Things will make more sense then, but only a little.\"

She cleared her throat rhetorically, giving the clear impression that she had practiced what she was going to say here.

\"Shortly after you left, I was recalled, and I actually got to enjoy some free time,\" she said. \"Well, as much as I could, after what happened. When I heard about what happened to you, with that squid raid, I... got a certain offer from an Incubator right afterward, and I took it.\"

Ryouko looked at Asami, then at the others. There was a certain question implicit in that statement, but she wasn\'t sure, yet, if she should ask.

She decided to let Simona continue normally.

\"After that, I was given a new assignment,\" she said. \"I was going to watch you, whenever I could. It took a while for me to be able to reach you. It didn\'t happen until you were in Paris. I was at that demon attack you were involved in. And no, I didn\'t start that one either---I was told it was suspicious.\"

*She was one of the mystery magical girls!* Clarisse thought, before Ryouko could. *The ones that were firing beams, but then...*

*Clarisse?* Ryouko thought.

*Hold on, I need to think, correlate information... Keep her talking.*

Ryouko didn\'t need to *keep* her talking, since she hadn\'t yet stopped.

\"Ultimately, I am here because I was told to make a deal. We would give the scientists here certain information, and in exchange I would be allowed to travel here, to join you, Ryouko. Whatever happens, I want to be there for you. We don\'t mean you any harm---I don\'t mean you any harm. If it comes to it, I\'ll be loyal to you over them. I am still your friend. I...\"

There was a long pause, punctuated for Ryouko only by the odd sense of Clarisse working on something in the background.

\"I wished to be able to protect Shizuki Ryouko, to be able to have her understand me,\" Simona said finally, hiding her face. \"Of course you can trust me. I don\'t know how to make you believe.\"

Ryouko could see the slight tears billowing.

She didn\'t know how to feel about any of this. A wish? For her?

It was touching, if true, but Ryouko could feel Asami\'s eyes on her side, and knew this was one more enormous complication.

*She\'s not kidding about the deal, by the way,* Clarisse thought. *We just got brand new, MSY‐internal self‐destructing classified orders, to keep whatever we learn here strictly secret. I didn\'t even know we had things like that.*

*So that at least is true,* Ryouko thought.

*Honestly, it all struck me as too outlandish to be false. It resolves certain discrepancies I\'ve been wondering about. But with regards to this wish, and your relationship with---*

*Yeah, I know. I can\'t let this hang.*

\"Simona, I...\" she began. \"As a personal matter. I have to let you know I am spoken for. Surely you know at this point that Asami and I are dating. I... there\'s no good way to say this, but if you think you\'re in love with me, if you want to stay with me, I have to know you\'ll respect that, and that right now I can\'t really trust you. Not until I see more.\"

Simona\'s eye twitched, and she took an obvious, deep breath.

\"I know,\" she said. \"Fate is cruel.\"

Asami watched Simona for a long moment, glancing at Ryouko as she did so. Apparently there was something she wanted to say.

*Well, if I may,* Clarisse thought. *Since we seem paused here for a moment, I\'d like to share some of my insights.*

*What is it?* Ryouko acknowledged.

*Nothing too groundbreaking, but I\'ve pieced together something about Paris. The other mysterious magical girl was Shizuki Sayaka, right? It stands to reason she would have noticed Simona.*

*She was traveling in disguise with us,* Ryouko thought.

*Yes, but you left her behind during the demon hunt, and you didn\'t see her again until the museum. That\'s when Kana\'s representative came to call off the deal, in light of \'new information\'.*

*And that\'s when I was told about the brain thing,* Ryouko thought, and that the whole thing was just a ruse to get a brain scan.*

*Yes,* Clarisse thought. *The whole thing fits a pattern where Sayaka, Kana, and Simona are involved somehow. They either met Simona there, or they were involved from the start.*

*I don\'t think they were lying to me in Paris though, about what they knew,* Ryouko thought.

*Me neither,* Clarisse thought. *You should ask.*

\"I have to ask,\" Asami said, before Ryouko could decide to do anything. \"You mentioned that you were a lab experiment from early in the war. Does that mean you\'re, well, artificial?\"

\"Pretty much,\" Simona said, with a trace of annoyance. \"At least in the way you mean it. I don\'t think of it that way, though.\"

\"Do you have any idea about the modifications that were done to me, then?\" Ryouko asked, leaning forward to involve herself. \"I\'m assuming you know about those.\"

Simona seemed to think about the question for a moment.

\"I heard about them,\" Simona said, shaking her head, \"but I don\'t know any more than what I\'ve been told, which I don\'t think is any more than what you\'ve been told. Some sort of brain region with anomalous genetic coding and no other implants?\"

\"That\'s right,\" Patricia verified.

\"The current theory is that the attack in Paris was to stop Ryouko‐chan from getting a detailed brain scan,\" Simona said. \"Not that it was very effective, mind you, thanks to me.\"

She nodded and smiled slightly, satisfied with herself, at least on this one matter.

\"But no, I don\'t know what\'s going on there,\" she said, focusing herself. \"It bothers me too, in fact.\"

\"And you got that from Shizuki Sayaka, right?\" Ryouko said. \"Or someone connected to her?\"

Simona looked surprised for just a moment, before managing to conceal it.

\"Not from her, not directly, though she did contact me in Paris, you\'re right. No, I learned it from the group I work for.\"

\"If so, and if you or your organization weren\'t involved in her modifications, then how *do* you know?\" Azrael asked sharply, the back of her shirt rising slightly. \"That\'s a bit suspicious, if you don\'t mind me saying.\"

Simona made a pained expression.

\"This is going to sound evasive, but I don\'t really know. I\'ve been told we have supporters high up who feed us information. But it\'s also true that I\'ve never tried to find out. It\'s one of those things where the less you know, the less you can tell people if you ever get in an awkward situation.\"

\"And you trust them?\" Azrael asked, with a hint of menace.

\"They raised me, or at least their agents did, and my parents will be getting quite an interrogation soon enough about all this. Maybe I\'m a fool, but I\'ve never killed anyone, or done anything I saw as malicious. That\'s all I can really say. I\'d be lying if I said I\'ve never wondered why so much was being kept secret from me.\"

There was a long quiet, during which Azrael stared at Simona as if intending to bore a hole into her skull with her eyes. It didn\'t take any special insight to know that Azrael was trying to read Simona\'s mind, or perhaps talk with her.

Patricia leaned forward and grabbed one of the pastries Simona had laid out earlier as snacks, heretofore untouched. She nibbled it nervously, and Ryouko decided she was better off just abstaining.

\"Just what *is* your power?\" Azrael asked. \"Telepathy?\"

Simona shook her head.

\"No, I just got trained after I made the contract. My actual skill is power amplification. Whatever you got, I make it much stronger. Purely support.\"

\"Soul‐based, then,\" Azrael said, turning it into almost an insult. "Quite close to telepathy.\"

\"Yeah, it made things easier,\" Simona said, shrugging. \"If you don\'t mind, I\'d really rather not show you *everything*. Would *you*?\"

\"If you really are as sincere as you say you are, I hope you will be able to share the whole truth one day,\" Azrael said. \"And I\'m sure you understand you won\'t be trusted until you *do*.\"

Azrael gave Ryouko a look.

*We need to talk privately, at least a little.*

Ryouko thought for only a moment before sending back agreement.

\"There\'s not much more I can say,\" Simona said, with a pained expression. \"I know nothing I can say will get me believed here. Only my actions here matter.\"

*Well if she\'s gaslighting me, she\'s doing a pretty good job of it, Azrael thought, carefully avoiding showing any change in her expression. She has startlingly good telepathic defenses, but I was still able to see a bit more than she wanted me to see, I think. Still, I didn\'t get the sense she was lying. Just that she was leaving things out.*

*That\'s hardly surprising,* Ryouko thought, following Azrael\'s example by returning the thought in accelerated fashion.

*Yeah,* Azrael thought.

*I planted another drone here,* Patricia thought. *With any luck, she won\'t notice it. I need reliable genetic samples.*

*Clever,* Azrael thought.

Patricia couldn\'t avoid showing a flash of pleasure at earning the older woman\'s praise. Thankfully, Simona wasn\'t looking at her.

\"Just put yourself in my shoes for a minute,\" Simona said. \"I\'ve barely lived any of my life outside of some kind of assignment. I know it\'s not rational, but Ryouko is all that matters to me, okay? I decided I might as well commit to that, for whatever it\'s worth. I have nothing else to hold on to, really.\"

Ryouko felt that hit a chord inside her unexpectedly, enough that she turned her face away. She knew what it was like to have only one island of certainty in a tumultuous world.

*What now?* Azrael asked.

*I don\'t know,* Ryouko thought. *But I don\'t think she\'s a threat to us. I don\'t think there\'s much more we can do without having you try to pry her open, and I don\'t know that Vlad would tolerate that, or that I would want you to do that. She... was my friend, after all. That\'s something. Let\'s see what she chooses to do after this.*

*That seems reasonable,* Azrael thought. *Though I\'d be worried about what we\'re not seeing.*

\"Let\'s talk again later,\" Ryouko said, looking Simona in the eye. \"I don\'t know what you want but... I don\'t think you want to just sit here in the background. Let\'s see what happens.\"

\"I know I\'ll have the chance,\" Simona said, eyes focused. \"I was told you would be sent somewhere soon, and I would be able to go too.\"

Ryouko felt herself making a sour expression, but restrained herself.

\"They really can tell the future?\" she asked, even as Azrael made an annoyed noise.

\"I have no idea. They\'ve been wrong before,\" Simona said. \"Or lying. But I hope not. Before you ask, I\'d like to repeat that I don\'t know how it\'s done.\"

\"I thought precognitives were supposed to be extinct,\" Patricia said, leaning back in her chair.

\"And rogue colonies like mine weren\'t supposed to exist,\" Azrael said.

Ryouko shook her head in dismay.

\"I believe you,\" she said. \"But I\'m not sure I like having my future foretold.\"

\"I\'ve never felt otherwise,\" Simona said, smiling slightly. \"We have something in common, then.\"

\"Yes, we do.\"

With that, Ryouko got up, turned, and walked out of the room, feeling Simona\'s gaze on her back. She had looked crestfallen, hopeful, or maybe some mixture of the two.

The signs were obvious, she thought. Something was waiting for them, like an iceberg looming in the distance. Maybe this time, she would be ready.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"This is the prototype super long‐range gravimetric scanner,\" Vlad explained, gesturing at a bulky assemblage set into the wall. A haphazard amalgamation of freshly manufactured parts full of odd angles and obviously extemporized attachments, it certainly *looked* like a prototype.

Ryouko and Asami nodded politely, while Director Tao frowned at a diagram visible only to him.

\"This one is my own work, inspired by harnessing some of the emissions of our previous experiments. It\'s the kind of thing I\'ve always wanted to build, but I\'ve never quite had a strong enough source.\"

He checked to make sure they were still following. They nodded politely again.

\"I\'ll cut to the chase,\" he said. \"I\'ve been running this device on the side. That\'s how I found *this*.\"

He held out his hand, a multicolored orb appearing above it, easily recognizable as a gravity diagram.

\"This appears to be a major Cephalopodan facility of some sort, based on both our data and some recent surveys by the Military. Command is very interested in knowing what it is---I\'d like to know what it is. But I can\'t gather information that detailed without a bit more... active participation. That\'s where you come in.\"

\"This is where I\'m supposed to say I don\'t like the sound of that,\" Asami said, her voice suggesting she was only half‐joking.

\"Yes,\" Vlad agreed, breezily acknowledging the comment. \"But it\'s not dangerous; I just need you two to do what you usually do, with a twist.\"

Asami glanced at Ryouko, who shuffled in place for a moment, before shrugging.

\"What twist?\"

\"Only that you pay attention to the readout,\" Vlad said. \"Previously, it was always an incidental measurement while you were trying to do something else, but I have a suspicion that with some active feedback you might be able to do better than that. I\'ll make sure you can see it while you work.\"

\"What will we be looking for?\"

\"Just better resolution, stronger signal, that kind of thing,\" Vlad said. \"We\'re still guessing at what the right things are to show. It doesn\'t have to work the first time.\"

\"A novel approach,\" Tao commented, arching an eyebrow. \"Letting them adjust their methods rather adjusting the instrumentation.\"

\"Well, we can recalibrate everything else too,\" Vlad said. \"But it seems silly to focus on only that while neglecting the power source.\"

He looked at Asami with a meaningful---but probably unnecessary---look.

\"Is it strictly necessary that I be here?\" Ryouko asked. \"Usually I\'m here to attempt final wormhole formation, but not much else. It sounds like we\'re not even doing that step?\"

\"Perhaps not,\" Vlad said, tilting his head slightly. \"But it probably wouldn\'t hurt, and I suspect the two of you would prefer to be together.\"

Something about the way Vlad said it made her blush and want to hide her face, to Asami\'s amusement.

\"Let\'s just do this then,\" Asami said, when she was done smiling.

The two scientists departed for the observation floor, striking up a discussion about the design of very long‐range gravimetric sensors.

\"Yes, I\'d definitely prefer to be together,\" Asami said, as Ryouko turned toward the small room they used as a changing room. \"But alas, someone decided to summon us for a special experiment right when we were trying to head back to our rooms. I\'m a bit disappointed, myself.\"

Ryouko smiled, remembering how annoyed Asami had looked at the interruption, then stepped into the room where her suit was stored, Asami following after her.

The door slid shut a moment later with a quiet *whoosh*.

She started to pull off her blouse, which had already unbuttoned itself, but paused when she noticed Asami watching her. It wasn\'t hard to track where her eyes were looking.

*Tell her to behave,* Clarisse thought, with a humorous undertone that made it clear she was joking.

Ryouko settled for rolling her eyes instead, turning away. It wasn\'t like there was that much to see, even if Asami was good at making her feel like she was hiding something really nice.

Ryouko glanced over, seeing that Asami was starting to change as well, and finished pulling off her blouse. It was inconvenient, not being able to wear too much clothing in the vacuum suit, but she could understand that that would have been a pointless convenience.

Cued by a ping from Clarisse, she came out of her train of thought and saw Asami looking again. Since the other girl wasn\'t fully dressed either, she also found her own eyes wandering downward...

\"Come on,\" Ryouko said, making a gesture with one hand. \"I\'m flattered by the attention, but now really isn\'t the time. What\'s with you today, anyway? It\'s not like we haven\'t changed in front of each other before.\"

She turned decisively away again, focusing on taking pieces of the vacuum suit and bending over to apply them to her legs. Each modular piece fit tightly into place, molding around her with a soft sucking noise.

Asami grabbed her by the arm and she turned, surprised.

Asami used that moment to kiss her full on the lips, and before she knew it she felt herself pulled in, leaning backwards against the wall to provide an angle. She felt Asami\'s hand on her lower back, moving adventurously.

\"Okay, really,\" she said, pulling back her head and grabbing the hand. "Not now, obviously.\"

\"Relax, I\'m not going to scandalize poor Director Tao,\" Asami said, stepping back. \"I just wanted to reassure myself that you\'re still mine.\"

Her eyes didn\'t look lustful, not exactly. They were more... possessive.

Ryouko shook her head wearily.

\"Not everything is about sex, you know,\" she said. \"There\'s more to a relationship than that. Haven\'t you been reading the guides?\"

It was Asami\'s turn to roll her eyes.

\"Yes, but they\'re not really designed for our situation, are they? There\'s nothing to do on this space station, and I\'m feeling nervous, with Del Mago around.\"

The last sentence was said casually... too casually.

\"I know it bothers you that she\'s here,\" Ryouko said, attaching the torso section of her suit. \"But you know I have no interest in her. Not in that way.\"

\"Yes,\" Asami said. \"But it\'s irrational, you know? I just feel like, sometimes, there\'s only one thing we ever do together, and you\'re not even that into it.\"

Ryouko paused for a moment, watching part of the suit find its place around her arm.

\"Well, come to think of it, even on Eurydome we were only ever busy with the usual stuff. Clarisse wants me to point out that we\'ve technically never even been on a date night, not really.\"

Asami chuckled.

\"Watching out for us as always,\" she said, smiling awkwardly. \"No, we haven\'t. But how are we ever going to do that here?\"

\"Well, there\'s always that flying dance thing Azrael wanted to do,\" Ryouko commented. \"And VR things in general. We\'ve been having some fun with that.\"

Ryouko looked away for a moment, using it as an excuse to think. There really weren\'t many good ways to go on dates here outside of VR. VR was fine, but it just seemed... proper to do it in real life, to go out together somewhere. And, well, while she was busy making decisions about Simona, why not make decisions about Asami?

\"The next time we\'re off this station let\'s book something,\" Ryouko said, leaning forward, letting Asami take a look at her still‐uncovered shoulder area. \"I\'m sure Sakura‐san can recommend something.\"

Asami blinked rapidly.

\"Alright,\" she said. \"It\'d have to be something we can both enjoy. I don\'t want to feel like you\'re doing it just for me.\"

\"Even if I did, it wouldn\'t be that bad,\" Ryouko said.

Asami turned away, looking at the doorway as she put together the last pieces of her suit.

\"Don\'t rush the experiment,\" Ryouko advised, as Asami\'s gloves wrapped themselves around her hands. \"If we manage to get it done right away, we\'ll have more free time to ourselves later. That would be worth it.\"

Asami made an odd expression, hidden briefly by the helmet passing over her face, her hair moving itself out of the way.

\"You\'re getting better at this,\" she said over the radio, shaking her helmeted head ponderously. \"It makes me happy.\"

\"Let\'s just go,\" Ryouko said, through her own radio.

The procedure afterward was familiar enough to be routine: walk out the door, turn right, step into the brightly labeled airlock, then wait briefly while the air was pumped out of the room.

As Ryouko stepped out of the airlock, watching Asami move into position near the center of the testing area---both horizontally and vertically---she realized how relaxing it was to just be able to float near a wall and watch. Nothing was expected of her here.

No, not quite nothing.

*Alright, Asami‐chan, you can do this,* she thought. *You\'ve got the focus.*

*Wait, Asami‐*chan? her girlfriend thought. *You never call me that.*

*I thought I\'d lighten the mood.*

*Geez, I... are you trying to cheer for me?*

Ryouko couldn\'t help but smile, a little.

*Well, yeah. That\'s what I\'m supposed to do. That\'s what Clarisse says to do.*

*Clarisse also says to stop claiming she was the source of the idea, Clarisse thought sourly. *Would it kill you to acknowledge you tried?*

*I\'m just embarrassed, you know,* Ryouko thought.

Ryouko wasn\'t sure how Clarisse managed to convey the sense of rolled eyeballs with an emotion.

\"I---well, thank you,\" Asami said out loud, obviously flustered.

\"We\'re, uh, going to start the procedure soon,\" Vlad said over their suit radio. \"Please get ready.\"

Asami hesitated a beat before getting into her preferred stance, raising her hands a little more ostentatiously than usual. Ryouko started to worry that maybe she had distracted her.

*There are married couples who are around each other less than you two are,* Clarisse complained. *And you\'re still acting like a flustered teenager.*

*I* am *a flustered teenager.*

*And I\'m less than one!*

*You know that doesn\'t count!*

Ryouko snapped out of her argument, feeling the world around her shifting. While she didn\'t have the innate sense for gravity that Asami did, she had gotten better at noticing what her soul gem was telling her, and right now it was telling her there was something big, and close.

There was no need to speculate this time on what it was. The distortion forming in front of Asami, where the world curved inward towards a circle of perfect black, was plainly visible, the graphical overlay inside her eyes an unnecessary extra.

At the beginning it had taken Asami half an hour to get this far. Now, only minutes.

A new item flickered into her world, a multicolored sphere that appeared to float in space next to her. This was the representation of the distant facility that Vlad had promised.

\"We need to try to boost the signal here, right?\" Asami asked. \"Get it to purple?\"

\"As a first step, yes,\" Vlad said. \"But it\'s not *just* that. There\'s also all that swirling nearby, which I believe is a detection artifact, not real signal. If you manage to get rid of that, it\'d really help analysis.\"

\"I will try,\" Asami said.

Ryouko watched silently as the vortex near Asami calmed, and as she experimented with forms of manipulation other than the wormhole procedure, probing to see what made the device work better. It seemed like painfully slow trial and error initially, but then, just as Clarisse was starting to pencil a couple more experiments onto her calendar, the orb turned a bright and angry purple, garish to look at.

\"Impressive breakthrough,\" Vlad commented.

\"Yes,\" Asami acknowledged. \"The truth is, it feels odd to me, like I understand this detector somehow. It shouldn\'t be this easy.\"

\"It could just be something that\'s natural to you,\" Ryouko said, recalling some of what she had read on power development.

\"Maybe, but right now it almost feels like I can sense it... myself...\"

She stopped talking then, stepping closer to the vortex and leaning in, enough that Ryouko started to feel slightly nervous about her getting too* close.

But Ryouko kept quiet, letting Asami focus. The swirling around the orb seemed to fade slightly, then grow stronger again. Whatever it was, Asami was struggling with it.

\"I don\'t think it\'s an artifact at all,\" she said. \"I can feel it oscillating. It\'s artificial, repeated... they\'re reflecting the rotation of the pulsar somehow, making it hard to see what\'s going on.\"

\"It\'s a concealment device?\" Vlad said. \"A noise generator? For what?\"

\"For exactly this,\" Asami said. \"Long‐range sensor probes.\"

\"We\'ve never previously attempted anything like this,\" Tao said.

\"Would you bet on that, if you were them?\" Ryouko said, speaking on Clarisse\'s behalf. \"I wouldn\'t.\"

Asami made an unhappy noise, clearly frustrated.

\"If they\'re going to all this trouble, then it\'s clearly important, whatever it is,\" Vlad said. \"They\'re countering a sensor methodology we don\'t even *have* yet.\"

\"You said it was a reflection of the rotation of the pulsar,\" Tao said. \"What did you mean precisely?\"

\"It feels like smaller versions of something big, rotating really fast,\" Asami said. \"Copied over and over, like reflecting echoes.\"

\"Could we filter that?\" Tao asked. \"A repeating pattern, echoed over and over...\"

\"Not just that,\" Asami said. \"There\'s something else on top of it. Some kind of manipulation.\"

\"I can try,\" Vlad said. \"I\'ve *already* tried, on the previous data, but that wasn\'t as detailed, and I didn\'t have this hint to work with. There\'s so much to account for, frame‐dragging...\"

His voice trailed off, as Asami\'s had earlier, doing his own form of thinking.

The line was silent again, and Ryouko heard only the quiet sound of her own breathing inside the helmet, as Asami moved her hands over the distortion, looking for all the world like a diviner consulting a crystal ball. The alien facility held its mysteries tight as ever, however, a swirling purple sphere twisting this way and that. It was really more of a shell, she supposed.

\"I might have something,\" Vlad said finally. \"I grabbed a few algorithms off the research boards and stitched something together. I don\'t have enough local processing power to do this in real‐time, so I requested time on a Governance computing cluster. They gave me the allocation. It won\'t be good for our secrecy to beam *that* much data through IIC---I suppose the lab will have to shift orbits again. Anyway, give me a second while I get this set up...\"

It took a few seconds, but the orb they were watching began to finally shift. The constant motion around the edges seemed to calm, then slow, and the orb itself started to fade at points, not receding into the greens and reds of low signal, but simply disappearing where there was nothing to see.

\"I see,\" Asami said. \"So that\'s how that works.\"

The orb shrunk abruptly, until it was no more than one‐tenth its original size, and other objects appeared, still dyed with the false color of sensor strength. They looked like beads forming a spherical mesh, surrounding a small sphere in the middle. No, a mesh of *space stations* surrounding a *pulsar*.

\"Oh excuse me, let me change the readout,\" Vlad said.

The incessant purple vanished, replaced by a more artistic‐looking rendition of the facilities, now accompanied with labels appended by Vlad. Pulsar, station...

\"Impressive algorithm,\" Tao commented.

\"No, it\'s not,\" Vlad said. \"It wasn\'t me. She---Miss Nakihara saw what it was doing, and followed up herself. The algorithm is barely doing anything now.\"

Ryouko turned her gaze from the orb back to Asami, who was still intently emplaced at her floating station. She wasn\'t sure how to put it. She was... impressed, perhaps?

\"It isn\'t just a concealment network,\" Asami said. \"That\'s just a useful side effect. They\'re using the pulsar\'s gravity for something. You see these specks flying in and out of the stations? They\'re ships, and there\'s a lot of them.\"

Ryouko looked as Asami directed, and saw the ships she was talking about. A constant stream of them flowed in and out, but so slowly it could only barely be called \'flowing\'.

\"They\'re not using their FTL engines,\" Asami said. \"Maybe it\'s too risky, or it disturbs what the station is doing. But these ships are cruiser‐class. They\'re carrying...\"

Asami paused again, leaving Ryouko with little to do but stare at the ships in the display. Perhaps it was a trick of the light, but they seemed to be growing larger and more detailed.

\"They\'re carrying fragments of the space‐time from around the star,\" Asami said, finally.

\"What? Carrying fragments of space‐time?\" Vlad echoed. \"Forgive the cliché, but that\'s not possible.\"

\"Not *very* possible,\" Tao said, chidingly. \"The containment unit for such a thing would be nearly impossible to build, and it would take an exorbitant amount of energy to keep it from reintegrating with surrounding space. There\'s been a couple of thought experiments on the matter, but nothing serious.\"

\"Just making something like that, even temporarily, would require nearly completely severing an entire island of particle interactions from everything around it. Severing every entanglement interaction. Only a black hole would ever do that naturally.\"

\"I\'m *sure*,\" Asami said, with more than a hint of annoyance. \"It\'s difficult to explain, but I can just *tell*. This kind of thing I understand intuitively. I have to. It\'s my own power. Just look at the data yourself.\"

\"I am,\" Vlad said. \"It is definitely consistent with your theory. But it doesn\'t answer why they would do something like this. And in such quantity.\"

\"The distance relations that govern our ordinary space‐time are an emergent property of its underlying structure,\" Tao said. \"To them, distance is not a real thing, and time is only the direction of more uncertainty. A region of space‐time that was somehow torn away from everything else would naturally want to return home. But home can be anywhere*.\"

\"What are you saying?\" Vlad asked.

\"I\'m not sure, it\'s just thinking out loud,\" Tao said.

\"Then let\'s gather as much data as we can, first,\" Vlad said.

\"I think maybe it\'s time for a break?\" Tao suggested, a trace of worry in his voice. \"This surely has to be a lot of strain on her.\"

\"I\'m not sure we can get everything back to this state,\" Vlad said. "This hasn\'t exactly been an easy procedure.\"

Ryouko stirred, realizing with a startled guilt that she had been forgetting to check Asami\'s soul gem meter, so wrapped up had she been in watching the work.

It was about one‐third drained. Nothing unmanageable, but more than she would have normally been comfortable with in non‐combat use.

\"Yeah, let\'s take a break,\" Ryouko said, when Asami didn\'t respond right away. \"Assuming you can make this work again?\"

It took Asami a moment to realize she was being addressed.

\"Oh, yes, yeah, I think I know what\'s going on now with this interference,\" Asami said. \"I guess a break wouldn\'t hurt.\"

Her voice was distracted.

\"Let\'s regroup here in a couple of hours then,\" Vlad said. \"That will also give us some time to look through the data and do some more analyses. I\'d have you know this is strategically valuable work---I\'ve gotten a number of inquiries about this from higher up, and it will be satisfying to be able to give some kind of answer. Field Marshal Tomoe is particularly interested.\"

The facility readout in Ryouko\'s vision disappeared, and Asami floated away from the anomaly in the center of the chamber. The anomaly itself began to fade, and Ryouko felt the pull of the machinery fade as well as they began to slowly settle back toward the ground.

Asami walked over to grab her hand. Perhaps it was her imagination, but Asami seemed to lean on her, just a little. Had it really been that bad?

*Are you alright?* she asked.

*I\'m fine. I just wanted to touch you, that\'s all.*

They stood in the airlock for a while, watching the atmosphere readout inside their helmets.

*It feels weird,* Asami thought finally, unprompted. *I\'m used to not really being the center of attention, but right now it\'s all about me. It feels like I\'m* doing *something, right? It\'s new to me. I can see why you like it, even if it scares me a little.*

Ryouko nodded, her helmet shifting slightly. She didn\'t have anything in particular to say.

*The thing is, something really bothered me about those ships,* Asami thought. *I feel like I should know what they\'re doing, but it\'s just not coming to me right now. It\'s so close, like my fingers almost grazed it, but so far at the same time.*

Ryouko stepped out of the airlock, thinking to herself that she had never seen Asami like this before.

*Well, you\'ll get another chance. Let\'s just recharge your gem and head back to our room. After that, we\'ll have plenty of time to have a little fun.*

*Yeah,* Asami thought noncommittally.

*Or plan our date?* Ryouko added, trying to be teasing.

*Even better,* Asami managed, and Ryouko could feel satisfied with a light touch of emotional warmth.

Asami still seemed distracted while they were changing; this time, her eyes weren\'t focused on Ryouko\'s body, but rather *past* it, as if she were looking at something else entirely. It was a bit unsettling, to be honest.

It was only when they were in the corridor walking back, passing Patricia in the hallway, that Asami grabbed Ryouko abruptly by the upper arm.

\"I have it,\" she said. \"I know what they\'re doing.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"It powers the alien blink technology,\" Director Volokhov said. "It\'s the solution to the paradox of the paradox drive, and the secret ingredient inside their blink cannons.\"

He paused rhetorically, taking a moment to adjust his sweater, one of the original Volokhov\'s most well‐known fashion accessories.

\"I would not normally be very certain of this, but Nakihara Asami says she is almost one hundred percent sure, and it is consistent with some of the theoretical guesses Director Tao and I have been making. The new simulations show that it is at least *possible* to \'mine\' contained space‐time fragments and use them for teleportation. Extremely difficult, but since when has that ever stopped them?\"

Volokhov stopped there, clasping his hands politely on top of the meeting table and awaiting feedback.

Mami glanced at Feodorovich and Anand, the other two members of this meeting. Their faces were composed, but serious. The General Staff had formed a working subcommittee for this topic, and its importance had just escalated drastically.

\"How much trust do you place in Nakihara\'s judgment?\" Mami asked, pouring herself some virtual tea. \"What would your certainty be without her input?\"

\"Only about twenty percent,\" Volokhov said. \"There are too many unknowns here. However, the historical record for predictions made by magical girls in a context directly relevant to their specialization is quite good, *especially* when they are unable to articulate a clear logical reason. You can check the records for the statistics.\"

He materialized a teacup and began pouring out some tea for himself, surprising Mami. Most AIs made a point of never appearing to consume human food, to make sure they could never be confused for human.

Mami sipped at her tea, considering. Truthfully, she hadn\'t needed Volokhov to tell her that, nor did she need to check the numbers. She knew quite well. But still, to have that kind of faith in one girl...

\"With respect, Mami, wouldn\'t this kind of thing be your specialty?\" Feodorovich asked, holding a mug of coffee. \"Perhaps you could talk to her?\"

\"I probably will,\" Mami said. \"She\'s under my command at the moment, after all.\"

\"I will be happy to run more experiments and simulations,\" Volokhov said. \"In fact, that effort is already underway.\"

Mami nodded wordlessly, making a note to Machina to consider Asami for a promotion. It only seemed appropriate, given the magnitude of what had been going on at Adept Blue in recent weeks.

\"For now, let us assume that she\'s right,\" she said. \"What are the consequences? Do we do anything?\"

\"We needed something that could buy us time, kneecap their operations,\" Anand said. \"A logistics hub like this is perfect, if we have any way of doing anything to it, and assuming this is the only one of its kind in the area.\"

She looked at Volokhov, the implicit question obvious.

\"As far as we know, it is the only one remotely near the Euphratic sector,\" he said. \"Indeed, we haven\'t even found a second one yet. It is possible there are no others near Governance space, as I am personally doubtful that we could miss them---though we are still looking. And there\'s a plausible reason why this is the only one: the magnitude of the infrastructure and space‐time manipulation involved in its construction strains imagination. Even the *shielding* required to withstand the pulsar\'s tidal forces at that proximity is difficult to believe.\"

\"It\'s still fairly deep in Ceph space,\" Feodorovich said, \"and this is no mere orbital facility. This is a full constellation of facilities, with unknown capabilities and apparently ridiculous shielding. It would be a bit absurd to even consider an attack, were the stakes not so high.\"

\"Well, that\'s one thing we\'ve been thinking about,\" Volokhov said, rubbing his cheek. \"As amateurs to military affairs, you understand. The aliens went to considerable effort to conceal the true nature of their operation from us, in a sensor modality we didn\'t even have until now. They certainly seem concerned.\"

\"It could just be reasonable paranoia,\" Anand said, waving her hand. "They have a sense of our technology level, and probably good guesses as to where we\'re likely to develop in the near future. It was a reasonable supposition, especially given the trump cards we\'ve used to surprise them in the past.\"

\"Just a thought,\" Volokhov said.

\"I\'ll have MilAdvise run some simulations,\" Feodorovich said, \"but my guess is that it would be very difficult to run a conventional fleet operation against these... pulsar mines. The fleet simply isn\'t built for deep incursions of this magnitude, and the aliens aren\'t sleeping on the job this time. We\'d need some novel angle.\"

\"Do we want to bring this to the full Staff?\" Anand asked. \"Even if we can\'t perform a strike, any new insight into the Ceph\'s blink technology should merit a thorough review of fleet doctrine.\"

Mami put her hands on the table, closing her eyes for a moment.

\"Eventually,\" she said. \"But not yet. Let\'s do a bit more investigation, I think.\"

Anand frowned, just a little, something she probably didn\'t even expect Mami to notice.

\"Alright, I suppose we can afford that,\" she said.

Mami knew what Anand was worried about, but there was something the other woman didn\'t know.

She looked away for a moment, pretending to check an internal data stream.

There was a bigger picture she still needed to fill in. A bigger picture in which Homura and Kyouko\'s divine being had accurately foretold a break in Cephalopod activity, and had asked her to visit again, when her vacation was over.

She was already on her way back down to Earth, and when she got there, there were some questions she wanted to ask. About the future, the nature of the war, what had happened to Homura, the meaning of life... all the things one might want to ask an alleged deity. She doubted she would get many answers, but she wasn\'t going to let... *her* wriggle out so easily.

More practically, she had a sense that having a hotline to the divine was a useful thing for the Chair of the General Staff.

\"I think the meeting is adjourned,\" she said. \"I\'ll see you next time.\"

As the simulation dissolved around her, she absently rubbed the soul gem on her finger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once, when she was young, Mami had wanted nothing more from the world than to keep her life. She even had the wish and soul gem to prove it.

She had regretted it immediately. Not the survival, of course, but that she hadn\'t wished for a bit more. The survival of her parents, perhaps?

Many girls would have lost themselves then and there, but it was Kyubey, of all things, who had talked her through it. Reminded her that life was still worth living, that she was a hero, that if nothing else the grief cubes she collected staved off universal heat death.

Her lips always twitched upward, thinking of that. She knew now that the Incubators didn\'t *really* care, that in their eyes it was all a big accounting game, where more magical girls alive meant more grief cube collection. If she was honest, she had even known back then. But it still felt good knowing that *someone* cared, sort of. Cared enough to whisper misshapen facsimiles of human comfort in her ear.

How Homura had scoffed when she shared that story! She claimed, with her typical unnerving certainty, that Mami would have been fine anyway, at least for a while.

In a way, life had been simpler then. She\'d had a purpose, a relatively simple one, and once she had filled in the missing slots in her heart, there really wasn\'t much else to it.

Things were different now.

She looked upward, shading her eyes against the scant light filtering through the stained glass of Kyouko\'s church. The stylized imagery, which had struck her as overbearing the first time, seemed a bit more relevant now, if still a bit abstract. It was one thing to think about life in terms of despair and hope, as magical girls often had to, but what she had to deal with was often far, far away from emotions like that.

At her request, Kyouko and some others had again cleared the hall and snuck her in---whatever she or they thought about her consultations here, she couldn\'t let word leak about her being here, at least not in any verifiable way. Still, if she was here too long and too frequently, the secret would be impossible to keep. There were too many curious magical girls who were capable of spying.

She patted the head of her favorite Incubator, who had decided to imitate falling asleep on her shoulder. It did cute gestures like that to lower the guards of the humans around it, similar to why Yuma kept a child‐like body. Even if everyone knew what was going on, it still kind of worked.

With a sigh, she made her way up to the Ribbon. She was here because she had been asked to come back, and because it didn\'t seem wise to refuse, but in truth, she was here because she wanted to be back. It wasn\'t just about the prospect of clear answers or a view of the future, so exciting to a military strategist. She had the same questions she supposed any human might, and despite herself and her skepticism, she couldn\'t avoid feeling a longing to know.

As she neared the Ribbon and its pedestal, Kyubey jumped off her shoulder, landing on the soft red carpet below.

*I suppose it surprises you to see me here,* Mami thought, looking down at the creature.

*Not really,* Kyubey thought. *This artifact possesses a fascinating allure to magical girls, particularly those involved in key events. I thought it highly likely you would be drawn here eventually.*

*You said once recently that Kyouko and Homura might be right,* Mami thought. *I suppose this is why.*

*It\'s fairly weak evidence, but it is evidence, of a sort,* Kyubey thought. *More interestingly, those girls who come here and appear to have an experience show anomalous behavior afterward.*

*Always so cagey. Have you tried examining the Ribbon yourself? It is sealed, of course, but for one such as you it can\'t be that hard.*

Kyubey walked in a small circle on the floor.

*That Ribbon is protected by more than just your technology. It is heavily guarded by the magic of the magical girls in this religious organization. It would be difficult.*

*Difficult, but not impossible. Have you tried?* Mami thought, refusing to let it escape the chain of questioning.

*It was considered,* Kyubey thought. *But I did not ultimately make the attempt.*

*That* was an answer, but now that she had it, she was no longer sure where she had been going with it.

*Proceed with your ritual, Mami,* Kyubey thought. *I will be watching.*

It vanished for a moment, reappearing a second later atop the casing of the Ribbon itself, in the curled‐up sleeping posture of a cat.

Mami shook her head at the Incubator\'s audacity---and at its use of her personal name---then ducked her head and closed her eyes, refusing to strike a prayer pose.

She had expected to wait a little, but a gust of wind blew across her face, startling her enough to open her eyes again immediately.

She was no longer in Kyouko\'s church, of course.

She let out a breath in the chilly air, watching the air fog in front of her. She recognized this place. There could be no mistaking the circular colonnade, the imposing statuary, or the marble floor, black as night.

She shook her head, closing her eyes for a moment against the sight. This was the atrium of the Rules Committee, the actual, *physical* Rules Committee, the symbolic seat of MSY legislative power.

It had been built at her direction at the height of the pre‐Unification Wars era, when no one would have batted an eyelash at such an ostentatious hyperclass palace, even on top of a skyscraper in Mitakihara City. The statues represented famous and powerful magical girls throughout history, the floor was meant to resemble the black night, and the columns... well, the columns were just there to lend an air of gravitas to the whole affair.

This was different, though. The floor here glimmered with stars, marble black as the depths of space. The statues, the originals of which were adorned with brilliant color, were instead faded, the paint peeling off in places, but were somehow *more* vibrant, in a way that made it impossible to shake the impression that they were watching, and might start moving at any moment.

They were also covered in vines, thorny and dense, and she was *pretty sure they depicted the wrong girls. Wasn\'t that Kyouko, with the spear...?

She stepped forward, narrowing her eyes to take a more careful look. Yes, that was, in fact, Kyouko, and beside her Homura, followed by Mami herself.

\"This is pretty,\" a child‐like voice said next to her.

Mami turned and looked down, staring for a moment at the now familiar child with pigtails and a starry‐eyed look.

\"Oh, Machina,\" she said, heart filling with an indefinable warmth whose source she could not place. \"I\'m sorry I keep forgetting about you.\"

She bent over, picking up the girl in her arms, the weight familiar from days long past, when she used to pick up Yuma---who had been too heavy for it, really, but one of the perks of being a magical girl was not having to worry about things like that.

She looked upward, feeling again the cold breeze on her face. The original Gallery of the Law was indoors, of course, and did not have a ceiling that opened up to an eternal night sky, a perfect mirror of the floor below. She enjoyed the view, though.

\"I thought I\'d spruce things up a little more this time around,\" a voice said, in familiar old Japanese. \"Something a bit more befitting.\"

This time, the entity that appeared in front of her was very visibly magical, a woman with a white dress, with an aura that seemed to shout divinity at the back of Mami\'s mind. Her pink hair floated eerily above the floor, and rather than end, seemed to fade away, disappearing somewhere else entirely. And her face... Mami could not bring herself to look at it.

\"Dropping the cute *kouhai* act?\" Mami asked. \"In retrospect, I found it a little manipulative. Of course you would know how to push my buttons.\"

\"I don\'t blame you for being suspicious,\" the woman said. \"But that was no act. Everything I said there was true. I have many guises. That was one of them, this is another. Not so much alternate faces as alternate points in time. Easy to access in a place such as this.\"

Mami frowned a little, shifting her arms as Machina turned to get a better look.

\"I suppose you\'re doing me a service, with this kind of candor,\" Mami said. \"I came here wanting answers, so you make a show of being a bit honest. But you won\'t tell me everything.\"

She didn\'t make the last part a question.

The being in front of her raised a gloved hand to her mouth and laughed, a melodious and cheerful sound with unsettling undercurrents, as if the air around her was laughing too.

Mami shook her head, amused too. What had she been expecting, trying to catch a possibly divine being off‐guard? She was letting her age get to her head.

\"Of course not,\" the woman said, turning away and stepping through the door that led into the main chamber. \"How could anyone tell you everything*?\"

Machina squirmed, signaling she wanted to be dropped, and Mami obliged, watching the girl follow the woman into the other room.

\"We all wear guises, Mami‐san,\" the woman said, turning to pat the girl on the head. \"Clarisse‐chan, Shizuki Ryouko\'s Tactical Computer, chooses to portray herself as no younger than her host, but Machina‐chan chooses otherwise.\"

\"Shizuki‐san is young,\" Machina said, voice affectless, as if in a trance. \"She needed someone who seemed more mature, to help carry her through hard times. Mami did not need that help---indeed, probably the opposite. We were programmed to be what our hosts needed us to be. But it\'s hard to keep that from affecting how we see ourselves. Not when we were so young.\"

The woman picked up Machina herself, stepping out of Mami\'s sight with long strides that seemed not to touch the floor.

\"Far more important than the face you present to the world is the face you present to yourself,\" she said. \"It defines who you are, it defines how you see your life, it defines how happy you are.\"

She left a short pause there for Mami to think, then stretched a hand out into the doorway to gesture her forward.

\"Come on in, then. I don\'t bite.\"

Mami stood still for a moment, then stepped forward slowly, shaking her head at herself. The threshold scared her, like she was a student stepping into the principal\'s office, and it bothered her, that she should be so unnerved. She wanted to believe that her mind was being magically manipulated, that this was the parlor trick of a being working a kind of therapy on her, but she couldn\'t really be sure of that.

The plenary chamber of the Rules Committee was, of course, primarily a ceremonial structure. The size of a large auditorium, it had difficulty seating even the key members of every political faction, much less the plethora of Rules Committee members. Even at the time of construction, it had been meant only as a place for key speeches, a place for Executives or the leadership to symbolically address the entire body, waiting just behind the curtain of the virtual world.

As such, it was designed for appearance rather than function, the ceiling painted with key moments in MSY history, the walls carved with depictions of various magical girls, all in the middle of making a wish, but all looking directly at the podium.

The intent was to fill the speaker with the sense that she had responsibility*, a quite deliberate effect that Mami herself had signed off on. She regretted it later, since she had come to find it rather unnerving.

\"That\'s what makes you different from the others,\" the woman said. "It always felt real to you. I\'m not saying the others don\'t care, but they never felt it as much. Homura‐chan, Yuma‐chan, even Kyouko‐chan, can sit down and turn human lives into statistics, and live with themselves in the end. But not you.\"

Mami turned and looked at the woman, now seated next to Machina on one of the spectator\'s benches. They had a plate of cookies next to them, which Machina seemed to be industriously working her way through, at a pace that would surely have required some milk or at least water in a real child.

The woman patted the spot next to Machina, and Mami stepped her way over, reflecting that, viewed like this, the woman was not nearly so imposing. She could almost be thought of as an ordinary human, even if the ethereal hair and missing face were a bit of a distraction.

\"I\'ve always had the impression it bothered me more than them,\" Mami said, taking a seat. \"I\'ve never tried to hide it. I\'ve always tried to make sure we remember the human cost. But I\'ve never thought I was better than them for it. To the contrary, I\'ve often wondered if I would have been a better legislator, a better diplomat, a better leader*, if I were more like them. If nothing else, maybe I\'d just be happier.\"

\"People can tell, Mami‐san. They can tell that you care, more than the others do. It\'s why they believe you, and why you keep getting put in these roles. It\'s *because* you care that they follow you. They know you\'re not trading them away for anything small. But they forget that it hurts you, knowing the lives you\'re responsible for, the lives you have to watch being destroyed, sometimes.\"

Mami found herself watching Machina eat, then grabbed a cookie herself and ate it, more to fill a gap in the conversation than out of any desire to eat. She didn\'t know what there was to say.

\"To put the pieces together,\" the woman said. \"You see yourself as a hero. Always have. There wasn\'t any other way, after what happened to you as a child. It was the only way to justify it all to yourself. But the worry gnaws at you, that you might *not* be a hero, that you might have done too much, or that you\'re simply not good enough. You want the world to just have its problems solved, and not need you anymore, so you don\'t have to face that risk.\"

\"So what?\" Mami asked, feeling Machina\'s eyes on her as she spoke. "Am I supposed to be impressed that *you*, all‐seeing deity of whatever, can read my mind, tell me what my complexes are? Even if you can, that doesn\'t make any of it go away. I am who I am.\"

The woman tilted her head.

\"But you came here to talk to me, didn\'t you? Not just because I asked, but because you had questions you wanted to ask. About the meaning of all this, the meaning of what you\'ve done all these years, and the meaning of what you *will* do. You hope that there is some satisfying answer, something that will make it all worth it. Beyond that, you want to hear from me if you are, indeed, a hero.\"

Mami closed her eyes, annoyed once again at herself. Why had she lashed out? The woman had said nothing wrong, only... undressed her, figuratively speaking. That was the problem, of course.

\"Well, am I?\" she asked, peering at the Speaker\'s podium. \"I won\'t lie. I want to know.\"

The woman picked up a cookie and placed it back down almost immediately.

\"It\'s your own recipe, Mami‐san,\" she said. \"You don\'t recognize it?\"

Mami looked down, confused by the apparent non‐sequitur, before picking one up and biting into it.

\"It\'s been a long time since I last baked,\" she said. \"But I think you know that. And, to be frank, it was never really all that special.\"

She wondered what relevance this had. Was the woman avoiding the question?

\"Let me tell you a story,\" the woman said, tilting her head up toward the ceiling. \"It\'s a very short one, so I hope you\'ll humor me.\"

She clapped her hands loudly, and Mami nearly startled as curtains that definitely weren\'t there before drew open to reveal an old‐fashioned projector screen, floating a few feet off the ground in the center of the auditorium. It flickered to life, and ornate numerals began counting down the beginning of a movie.

The characters that appeared on‐screen were rendered abstractly, in stop‐motion, as if a fantastical picturebook were brought to life. The woman spoke as they acted out the story.

\"Once upon a time, in the bad old days when magical girls paid dearly for their wishes, one girl who had lost everything took a new girl under her wing, and taught her everything she knew, and told her what magical girls *should* be. Warriors against the darkness. Guardian angels. Defenders of the helpless.\"

These last phrases were accentuated with fairy tale imagery, of a girl with a sword standing against the night, an angel floating over a cityscape, a girl protecting another with a wall of chains. Mami, however, saw something a little too familiar about the silhouettes.

\"One day, a calamity struck the city, an unprecedented disaster that threatened to destroy everything they loved. The threat was unimaginable, unstoppable. And they fought, and fought, until finally the older girl fell dead. The cause was lost, and there was no hope, but the new girl remembered what she had been told, remembered all that she had been taught, and plunged back into the breach anyway.\"

The girl on‐screen clenched a darkened hand for a moment, then dove forward, into the maw of some sort of laughing creature.

\"She died too, of course. This was no fairy tale, no heroic movie, and she didn\'t even manage to save the city, which was unceremoniously leveled. She was only an ordinary magical girl, after all, and the universe doesn\'t care.\"

The film lingered there, black filling the screen for a long, poignant moment.

\"But while the universe might not care, humans do, and there was another girl there to witness it all. She wept, for what she had seen, and wished fervently for another chance. For them all to have another chance.\"

The image swirled, and the black gave way to a soft, familiar glow.

\"And though the journey was long and lonely, at the end, there was hope---hope, through which they all were saved. And all because one girl had withstood the darkness in her heart, and tried to make the best of an empty world.\"

The screen transitioned to a pale white, showing the first, older girl walking home alone from school, a bag in her hands, head bowed. The details were obscured, blotted out artistically by the filmmaker.

\"So you tell me, is this girl a hero? If you had asked her, she wouldn\'t have said so. Her regrets were many, and her impact little. When the end arrived, and she knew there was nothing she could do, she led the attack *anyway*, because it was right. And though she never knew it, that made all the difference. I wish there had been some way to tell her.\"

Mami waited, choosing to study her hands for a moment, before saying:

\"It fits all the usual definitions of a hero. A tragic one, seeking some kind of redemption, I imagine. But you\'re telling me this story for a reason. Is the girl me? Was this story erased and replaced by our world, with the MSY? I struggle to make the pieces fit, but there are some wishes that change reality...\"

\"You have always been a hero,\" the woman said, taking her hand. "Think about how the stories go. Heroes are celebrated not just for their deeds, but for their heroic souls. You have a heroic soul. I would know. And still, Humanity needs that hero.\"

Those last words jolted Mami, who had been falling into an introspective daze. She had been telling the truth earlier, the validation *did matter---even if she hadn\'t known how much.

She could---she would---let those feelings wash over her.

But not yet.

\"That\'s right,\" Mami said. \"This isn\'t *just* to talk about me, this is supposed to also be about the war.\"

\"I was going to remind you eventually,\" Machina said, sucking on a juice box she had materialized from, apparently, Mami\'s memories. \"You were going to see if she would tell you about the future.\"

\"That\'s privileged knowledge, Mami‐san,\" the woman said, raising a finger rebukingly. \"I can\'t really give that away easily. Do you have any idea the kind of causality problems that entails?\"

She waved her hand ominously.

\"You do *not* want to see the equations.\"

Mami wrinkled her brow, struck by the absurdity of being lectured on this, and on its presentation. Was she... being made fun of?

\"What about Akemi Homura then?\" Machina asked. \"Can you tell us about her? We\'re pretty sure she\'s still alive, but what is she doing? Is she alright?\"

Mami wouldn\'t have thought it possible for a faceless divine being to look fazed, but somehow she did, shoulders dropping *just* a little, so that Mami wasn\'t sure if she was imagining it.

\"It\'s complicated,\" the woman said.

She paused, seeming to decide that she needed a different answer.

\"I know that in your heart she\'s always going to be your *kouhai*. That kind of caring is what makes you *you*. But you can trust that I care about her too, and that what she\'s working on is important. She would not have left otherwise.\"

\"The last time I saw her, she was half‐insane,\" Mami said, making an effort to keep her voice neutral. \"It is difficult for me to believe she was thinking clearly.\"

Again, Mami thought she saw the woman waver, just a little.

\"Perhaps not. The road she walks is not an easy one, and it is in some sense my fault. She will need your support, and when she does, you will find her.\"

\"And what exactly will she need my help *with*?\" Mami insisted. "You\'re avoiding the---\"

She recoiled before even finishing the sentence, cringing at the anger that grated against her soul like sandpaper, the woman\'s displeasure seeming to imbue every sensation, every thought. She hadn\'t known it was possible for reality itself to warn you.

\"You remember what I said about causality? I\'m not answering that, just like I\'m not here to provide you a roadmap to the war, no matter how much you think you might want it,\" the woman said. \"You wanted a straight conversation, so that is why I am here in my more... cynical form. These are the most direct answers anyone has ever gotten from me. It was not easy to make this safe. I would be grateful, if I were you.\"

Mami looked to the side for a moment, wishing that she could at least look this woman in the eyes. But this was no equal negotiation, obviously, and she had been rudely reminded that this was *Her* world, in a way she preferred not to repeat.

\"I suppose that\'s fair,\" she said eventually. \"I would say I won\'t stop looking into this, but I would guess that whatever I do is what you want me to do anyway, if you really *can* see the future.\"

The woman made a scoffing noise, almost a laugh, but did not deny it, and no further reply came for a while.

It was hard to tell, but it seemed like her thoughts were elsewhere.

Eventually, the woman sighed, and a sudden breeze blew over them, carrying away the tension in the air. Mami still couldn\'t see her face, but had the distinct impression that the woman was now smiling at her. The mood had changed.

\"I called you back here because I knew you would need some support,\" the woman said. \"And, yes, to tell you a little about the war. The mining operation at the pulsar concerns you, doesn\'t it?\"

Mami considered the change in topic.

\"Not just the pulsar mines, but the squid build‐up,\" Mami said. \"The mines are simply one way to hit back, maybe. I wish we had more. I wish this war didn\'t...\"

She paused, weighing her next words, even if both of the other parties here could hear her thoughts.

\"I wish it didn\'t feel like I was stuck in the keep of a slowly‐crumbling castle,\" she said. \"The military projections for conventional war, as carried on so far, are poor. I don\'t need to tell you that. The current strategy is to stall it out, and wait for a technological breakthrough or *bona fide* miracle. It doesn\'t feel good; it doesn\'t feel right. I feel like I should be *doing* something, and I\'m trying. It was so much easier when you could just shoot the problem with a cannon.\"

\"You\'re doing your best, Mami‐san,\" the woman said. \"And you\'ve never made the most of yourself at the front lines, no matter how satisfying it would feel. And about the pulsar... let\'s just say I have a positive feeling about that.\"

Mami thought about that for a moment. She knew that just the hint was a major concession, but...

\"That\'s it, then?\"

The woman shrugged, an oddly fluid motion that seemed somehow uncanny, like an approximation of the human gesture.

\"Tell me, Mami‐san, what are your opinions of the Cephalopods?\"

\"The aliens?\" Mami asked, perturbed by the change of topic. \"They\'re a genocidal menace. They showed up out of nowhere to attack us, they\'ve killed millions, they\'re monsters. What *should* I think about them?\"

\"Their behavior is a bit odd, though, isn\'t it?\" the woman asked. "They really don\'t seem like they\'re all that interested in finishing the job.\"

\"Tell that to anyone who has had to fight them,\" Mami said, shaking her head at the line of discussion. \"They certainly seem damn interested in finishing the job then! I know...\"

She paused, realizing that she might have started getting a little heated.

\"I know the way they behave doesn\'t really seem to make sense when you consider the bigger picture, but there are theories about that. Maybe they just don\'t want to take us to the brink unless they\'re sure they can wipe us out in one go. That\'s a sure way to trigger a wish I wouldn\'t want to be on the other side of.\"

\"How would they even know about wishes?\" the woman asked. \"Have they ever seen one?\"

\"It can\'t be ruled out, but it doesn\'t have to be wishes. They might just have noticed that we keep pulling off impossible comebacks. It\'s possible they\'re just keeping the pressure on while they prepare an impossibly large force. It\'s... it\'s kind of my nightmare, to wake up one day and find every front collapsing at once.\"

She hadn\'t meant to say that last part until she said it, but it had been the natural thought and, well, who else could she could reveal it to other than these two?

\"I don\'t think that\'s terribly likely,\" the woman said. \"But you don\'t know very much about these aliens, do you?\"

\"We don\'t,\" Mami said, frowning at the statement of unlikelihood. "Do you?\"

She said the last question with an air of dawning realization. Indeed, she had been so focused on questions about the war and the future, that she had failed to realize that she could ask about *the aliens*.

\"After the initial stages of the war, the aliens sure adapted to us fast, didn\'t they?\" the woman said, not directly answering the question. \"Self‐destruct modules to make capture more difficult, siloed knowledge to make mind‐reading less strategically effective, all kinds of little tricks.\"

\"We thought their AIs were just really good at contingency response,\" Mami said.

\"In the twenty years since, have they ever struck you as particularly adaptive*?\" the woman said. \"Only some of the time, right?\"

\"Yes, only some of the time,\" Mami agreed.

\"Just food for thought,\" the woman said.

She ducked her head, and Mami was particularly bothered for a moment that she couldn\'t read this being\'s expression.

\"Who *are* you?\" Mami couldn\'t help asking.

\"Just a friend,\" the woman said, standing up and making a show of patting her dress. \"I am sorry, but I really should be going.\"

Mami started to protest, but it died on her lips when the woman turned, and Mami could *see her eyes*.

The world changed around her, the plenary chamber warping, its architecture turning visibly alien, overly round. The seats around her filled with aliens, frozen in place, dressed in robes of patterned color. Below her, at what would have been the speaker\'s podium, stood a single Cephalopod, dressed like the others, facing upward as those nearest stood and pointed, or raised tentacles.

It was all Mami could do not to recoil at the sight, but somehow, she thought, the aliens were angry at the speaker.

Next to her, the woman turned, and Mami found her eyes drawn oddly to her hair, which had started waving slowly, forming loops in the air.

*Go now,* the woman\'s voice said in her mind, with a resonance that drowned out all thought, a cadence that seemed inhuman. *You have work to do.*

And then she was back in the real world, eyes already open, and the Incubator was looking at her, and she could feel Machina in her head again.

## Triple Point 

> Comparing the world of yesteryear with the world of today, one has a sense of jarring dislocation, accentuated by the fact that so many alive today have no real sense of what has even changed. They may know the answer intellectually, but in their heart, like someone who has lived through it all? Not a chance.
>
> It is almost too easy to talk about the weather. Global average temperature is back to the historical human norm, managed by Governance terraforming and solar shades, but that does not make it the *same*, a fact which is drilled into every primary school student on a school trip. The ice caps may be back, but the rains no longer fall where they once did. Only the most enduring climactic features, like the monsoon, persist. And it is almost passé to point out that no one in the megacities has any real feel for this.
>
> What matters, after all, is not the exact temperature but how we got here, and the era before and during the Unification Wars saw the most unstable climates of recorded history, containing both unthinkably hot summers and ice‐cold nuclear winters. Along with over half the prewar human population went enormous chunks of ecological diversity. Well‐known species, animals I had grown up seeing in magazines, disappeared into oblivion, except for a few individuals in the surviving zoos. And that doesn\'t even begin to tell the loss. Nearly every viable fishery collapsed---synthesizers were a pressing need for a long time, unless you liked eating nutrient paste.
>
> But you know what? That\'s not really what gets to me. When I was young, I saw almost every part of Earth. Almost every country, in the course of various wars, events, history. None of that is the same anymore. Not just the nation‐states, but the *people*. Where they live. *How* they live.
>
> Everything was changed by the wars. You can\'t empty a world out without emptying out its homes. The bustle of New York City, the towers of the Middle East, the ridiculous *crowds* of India, old Rome---all of that is gone now. We\'ve tried to rebuild the really important stuff, but it\'s not organic. I\'ve tried visiting---sometimes it feels like even the residents are just lingering tourists.
>
> It\'s funny what survives, though. No one has strictly needed to farm in centuries, and Governance gives every incentive to move into the city, but a few people still insist on living out on the land, working out there even. There are still farms, plantations, ranches, and thank heaven for that.
>
> I will probably never see a lumberjack or oil field roustabout again, though...

> General Order No. 2461‒37 reprioritizes the investigation of Cephalopod society, economics, and, above all, motivations. After two decades of only halting progress on this front, and the sense that further progress was likely impossible, this comes as a considerable surprise. However, our sources indicate that Chair of the General Staff Tomoe Mami has begun a major push into the research. When asked, a spokesperson for the General Staff declined comment on the order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I have to say, I did not expect such a personal visit,\" Director Volokhov said, escorting his guest down the hallway. \"I would have prepared more with more warning. As it is, I hardly have a reception fit for the occasion.\"

\"That won\'t be necessary,\" Mami said, shaking her head. \"This is just a stopover. I wanted to talk to the girls here personally, since I was so close already. You\'re really not that far from *Carthago*.\"

She wasn\'t being entirely honest, of course. The recent successes aboard Adept Blue, and the corresponding task of turning them to Humanity\'s best advantage, had been occupying much of her mind lately. But no amount of hospitality that Volokhov could place on her would make the job easier.

\"It\'s a shame you missed Director Valentin. She just left a couple of days ago. She\'s not really a specialist on the subject matter at hand, but I daresay her input would have been useful. After all, before she became an administrator, she was on the Von Rohr forcefield team.\"

She decided not to embarrass him by pointing out that she had already known about Director Valentin, since Machina had brought it up when reviewing the station\'s visitor logs earlier. Nor would she say that, like Machina, she found it just a touch... suspicious.

\"Anyway,\" Volokhov added. \"At your request, I did rearrange the lab schedule to have the girls available for this time slot. I must insist you take a tour of the facilities and observe one of our newer experiments. I know I brought you in here before, but it\'s not like there were functioning wormholes to see last time, were there?\"

Mami smiled politely at the AI\'s solicitousness. She had no intention of leaving the station *without* seeing at least one experiment, provided it was a real experiment.

\"As long as we\'re not taking on any needless risks,\" she said. \"I wouldn\'t want to ask them to do anything just to show me.\"

\"I understand what\'s important,\" Volokhov said, ducking his head in response.

The AI stepped in front of her, gesturing at a door to her right, which slid open in apparent response. She stepped through, Volokhov\'s avatar following close behind.

Nakihara Asami and Shizuki Ryouko were already standing, waiting for her in one of the station\'s conference rooms, dressed in their ceremonial uniforms as she had asked. Naturally, they were part of why she came here, though not in a way Volokhov was likely to suspect.

\"Good afternoon, girls,\" she said, even though it was really more like evening station time. \"I trust you\'ve been well.\"

\"As well I can be, isolated on a station like this,\" Ryouko said, with the smallest of glances at her companion. \"No offense to Vlad\'s hospitality.\"

She paused, considering something.

\"But, good to see you anyway, Mami‐san.\"

Mami couldn\'t fault girls as young as they were for chafing under the confinement, especially compared to their previous posting on Eurydome. She acknowledged the greeting, closing her eyes for a moment, but not moving to take a seat, as might have been expected.

\"Well, first things first,\" she said, turning to face Asami. \"I asked you to arrive in your ceremonial uniform.\"

The girl shifted self‐consciously, glancing at Ryouko while pulling at one of her sleeves, and Mami allowed a smile to creep up the side of her face. The nervousness was natural: the girl couldn\'t help but wonder what Mami had planned.

A moment later, Clarisse and Machina appeared, materializing out of thin air with a custom sparkle effect. Clarisse was using an \"older Ryouko\" form, which Mami supposed made sense, but Machina was using what was obviously a child form of Mami, which was honestly kind of embarrassing.

They were, however, dressed in the same uniforms as their human hosts, and she couldn\'t help but notice that Machina looked adorable. Volokhov even bent over and ruffled her hair, a gesture Mami wished she could replicate.

\"I feel almost left out,\" Asami said, eying the two TacComps, but not questioning their presence.

\"Don\'t be, this is your event,\" Clarisse said, grabbing Machina by the hand and spinning her around.

Mami nodded in agreement, making sure she caught Asami\'s attention. She had, of course, given a hint to the purpose of this ceremony beforehand, but had stopped short of telling the others anything for certain. She liked to indulge in little surprises every once in a while.

\"As you may know, promotions for magical girls in the military operate a bit differently from promotions for everyone else,\" Mami said, smiling as she worked her way through a familiar bit of oratory. "Outside of the true leadership positions, they represent partially how important you are to the service, rather than just your exact position in the chain of command. This is especially true in the non‐combat branches.\"

She paused for a moment, reaching into her pocket to retrieve a marker of rank.

\"You may take this, then, as affirmation of your importance to us, and Governance\'s reminder to all that you are not just a weapon or a tool, but an individual worthy of respect.\"

She stepped forward, pinning the marker to Asami\'s shoulder. The girl looked surprised, almost overwhelmed, even though it must have been easy to guess what was going on. Mami smiled brightly, thinking back to the MHD report that had said the girl felt inadequate and needed positive affirmation.

\"Congratulations, first lieutenant.\"

\"I guess I shouldn\'t be surprised,\" Asami said. \"It makes sense, given what we\'ve done here, even if I don\'t feel like I\'ve done that much in combat.\"

She shook her head at the attention she was getting, even as Ryouko gave her a hug and assorted AIs clapped politely.

*I really haven\'t done that much,* Mami could hear her think, probing just* a little. *It\'s all just because of my power, anyway. It\'s not like I did that much.*

Mami managed to avoid biting her lip at the girl\'s thought. It was the kind of sentiment she was familiar with, something she had seen in a hundred people, but not one that was easy to respond to. It was human nature, almost, not to give yourself permission to be happy.

\"The rank is something to be happy about,\" she said, looking Asami in the eye. \"It doesn\'t matter how you got it.\"

She put a hand to her mouth, wondering how to proceed. This wasn\'t the only reason she was here, and a part of her wanted to defer the main topic to sometime later, after she had visited the other girls on the station, and even enjoyed herself a little.

But business was business, she decided, and she gestured at the others to take a seat around the small conference table. Machina jumped onto one of the seats and shimmered slightly, taking on an older form so her head would be visible over the table. She frowned, then returned to her previous form, the chair extending its legs underneath her instead.

\"I have looked over the results of the wormhole experiments,\" Mami said, after looking around the table to make sure everyone was settled, "and the General Staff is very pleased with the results. However...\"

Here she paused, both for rhetorical effect and to choose her words carefully.

\"Well, this is privileged information, but we don\'t exactly have the luxury of time. Not as much as one might think.\"

She briefly met their gazes, making sure they understood, before nodding at Machina. The girl leaned over the table, making a show of poking at imaginary buttons. A holographic presentation shimmered to life over the table a moment later, and Machina used it to explain, with brief military‐style transmissions, the situation currently prevailing in the war, particularly the aliens\' unexpectedly rapid offensive buildup after their defeat in the Euphratic Sector.

\"If we can\'t prevent or greatly delay this offensive, Governance will have no choice but to go on a much more aggressive war footing,\" Mami said. \"And while that may stave off defeat in the short‐term, there will be no question that we could not win in the long‐term. We would have to consider desperate measures, measures that haven\'t been thought about since the height of the Unification Wars.\"

She didn\'t have to fill in that particular blank space---that could be done by anyone who had a passing familiarity with history, or even with the political debates surrounding the conduct of the current Contact War.

\"And you\'re hoping *we* can provide the kind of miracle everybody\'s looking for,\" Volokhov said, without making it a question.

He clasped his hands on the table, giving Mami an appraising look.

\"Pretty much,\" Mami admitted. \"You have already made a successful wormhole, and you have already given us a relatively undefended target. If you could scale the wormhole up, we might be able to strike them once where they\'ll never expect it. Destroy their logistics and delay their offensive. Everything we have suggests that a pulsar mining operation would be one of the few things they would find truly difficult to replace.\"

Volokhov leaned back in his chair, which flexed itself backwards to reflect the movement of his holographic avatar.

\"Those are words a research director should love to hear. It sounds like an unlimited resource allocation, as many personnel as I could want, collaborators... but somehow I still feel a sense of foreboding. It\'s a big responsibility, and...\"

He glanced over at Asami and Ryouko meaningfully.

\"Not just a matter for me. It affects them too, and I am aware they may not be all that thrilled with staying here.\"

A trite \"we all make sacrifices\" flashed into her head, but she waved it away. There were more useful things to be said.

\"I know,\" she said, shaking her head slightly. \"Trust me, I know. But it is the best choice, and in times like these, only the best choice will do. I won\'t tell any of you that I care, or that I understand, because you know that I do. That doesn\'t change anything. Right now, there is only one choice. Maybe in the future there will be more.\"

She looked at the girls in question, feeling Machina and Volokhov\'s gaze on her, feeling judged.

\"This isn\'t just about keeping you under watch anymore, or about giving you something to do. You\'ve made yourself important, and the thing about being important is that you no longer have any choices. You can only do what is right, what you have to. That is what I do.\"

She blinked, the moment passing, and felt a twinge of embarrassment. She had sounded like she was speaking out of a motivational brochure of some sort, one for the too responsibility‐laden.

But it worked, because of course it had. The two girls looked at her with an odd sort of awe, the kind of awe one might have when peering up at a particularly ancient tree. She wasn\'t sure she appreciated it.

Then Ryouko blinked herself, swallowing as she did so, and Mami sensed that she was about to say something risky.

\"I don\'t think we mind doing that, not for something this important, even if it *has* been a little dull here. But would it be possible to schedule a break? According to the usual rules, we\'re due for a little leave, and surely there must be some time we can take off. Equipment upgrades, something like that?\"

Ryouko cast a glance at Volokhov, and Mami followed her look. The AI could speak to that better than she could.

He sighed.

\"Well, I\'m always interested in more experiments,\" he said. \"But it is true that if we\'re going to upscale, we\'re going to have to build something new. Bigger. Possibly larger than this facility. We would have to pull in researchers from across human space, requisition resources on a military scale. I would love to hide ourselves in deep space, but we\'d probably want to use the energy of the Icarus cloud...\"

He trailed off there, realizing that he had tangented.

\"Anyway, I am sure there would be time somewhere for you to take a break. It is only fair. As long as you go somewhere absolutely safe.\"

The last sentence was mild and calmly said, but somehow he managed to make it contain an undercurrent of worry. Mami wasn\'t sure if the AI might be growing attached, or if this was standard concern for important experimental subjects.

\"Yes, that goes without saying,\" she said. \"And I would recommend somewhere close, probably even on Earth or Mars if possible, to shorten travel time. Governance will cover your travel expenses, of course.\"

To her surprise, Asami smiled sheepishly.

\"Don\'t worry about that,\" she said. \"We already have an idea.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Living in the cities, it is easy to forget how much of Earth\'s surface has depopulated. During the Unification Wars and the troubled times that preceded them, entire regions emptied out, their populations becoming refugees, fleeing the war, or simply dying. In many cases, they were fleeing epochal famines, their sources of food vanishing under an erratic climate. They fled to the cities, the rich nations, where food could still be grown in more managed climates, or in the worst cases manufactured. All of the hard work of prewar international cooperation, the solar shades, the geoengineering, the resources shipped in from wealthier nations, fell apart in the wars, as countries turned what they could still afford into managing their own ecologies.\"

Asami paused, nodding to herself in satisfaction, before turning her head slightly to check if Ryouko was listening.

She was, of course. It was a topic that was at least loosely connected to her own interests.

Instead of meeting Asami\'s eyes, she regarded the girl, who had stopped, raising her arms as if to embrace the landscape in front of her. It had been a weird speech, a historical narrative that sounded odd coming from her mouth, almost as if she had run it through her TacComp for textual refinement, which she might have.

She stepped forward, taking her place next to Asami and making a show of looking down from their mountainside, even though she had already seen it. They were on a trail in the tropical Andes, looking down on a lush green reconstructed rainforest, and beyond it the yellowish‐brown dry zone that it had been reconstructed *from*.

She could fill in the rest of Asami\'s story without help, about how global warming, climatic variance, bioweapons, and even nuclear warfare had combined to destroy ecosystems the world over, and how even now much of the Earth was uninhabited, and moreover rather inhospitable to habitation. Governance had concentrated the population into the best land, creating massive urban centers and idyllic rural areas for maximal economic efficiency, while it worked stubbornly on the problem of re‐terraforming Earth. Giving Humanity back the planet of its ancestors, so to speak.

She knew that because it was a common refrain in the educational material they had been taught as children, an explanation for why they should care about biology, ecology, and organisms, in a world where most children grew up with technology, machines, and computers.

So she stood there, looking out over a brilliant landscape of green, blue, red, and brown, accentuated by shades of infrared and ultraviolet, and a seemingly endless potpourri of scents, carried aloft by the wind. Birds sang, insects buzzed, and she thought she could even hear some monkey calls, far in the distance. It was mid‐afternoon, and the temperature was pleasant despite the humidity.

It was not really a natural forest, of course, no matter its aspirations. Most of the species here had been painfully reintroduced or reconstructed, trusted to expand and diversify by naturalists with crossed fingers. Water was brought in from vast distances, or condensed from the atmosphere on site, until the climate could be convinced to once again rain copiously on the land here. A small army of drones worked at the edge of the desert, building temporary greenhouses and seeding waves of hardy, nitrogen‐fixing crops to restore the soil, until the land could take care of itself.

And, of course, they wouldn\'t truly be out here if it wasn\'t absolutely safe. Drones disguised as almost every native animal watched the forests, kept their trail clear, and would warn them if any large predators chose to wander their way. In a way the environment was almost as artificial as natural.

Still, no matter how many caveats you inserted, it was beautiful.

\"Wasn\'t there an entire conflict over the ecology management?\" Ryouko said, turning finally towards Asami. \"Something about a solar shade?\"

\"The Shade War, yes,\" Asami said, accepting her cue. \"A dumb name.\"

Ryouko couldn\'t help but agree, but that was the name that had stuck. Most of the major space projects had stayed remarkably intact throughout the war, but one of them was special, since it served primarily to protect East Asia, which was mostly on the UF side. That put it on the targeting lists.

Asami turned away from the vista, gesturing the two of them farther down the path. They were here to spend a week out on \"approved wilderness activities\", a glorified camping trip where they were expected to also take surveys of local wildlife, check in on the drone population, and not do anything stupid*, or they would learn exactly how the Governance legal system functioned. So the cheerful ranger had warned them.

She shrugged, feeling the weight of her backpack on her shoulders, suppressing a smile as she watched Asami\'s CubeBot cling to the top of her bag, single eye warbling to and fro as it interacted with the local networks. There were no demon spawns out here, so they had to pack all they needed.

There was something about all this, the new sights and sounds, the light sense of adventure, the feel of walking off into the forest, that greatly lifted her mood. It helped make the many concerns swirling around her soul feel... farther away, even if their shadows seemed always just at the edge of her awareness.

Asami, too, seemed to be in a buoyant mood, humming a song as she walked, pausing every so often to look at this or that plant. The canopy here was sparse, high up the slope, and afforded the luxury of encountering relatively few plants at a time.

\"Is something wrong?\" Ryouko asked, when Asami paused about twice as long as usual at a specific fern growing in the shade of a tree.

\"Is it just me, or does this look like a wire?\" Asami asked, raising a section of leaf with one hand, showing her where part of it had snapped off. Indeed, something that looked like a bit of metal string was dangling out of the stem. As they watched, it slowly unraveled into even thinner strands, gossamer fibers breaking apart in the air.

\"Did you just snap it or something?\" Ryouko asked.

\"We\'re supposed to be taking samples,\" Asami said, rolling her eyes. "You could at least pretend to have paid attention.\"

\"Ah, I just thought we weren\'t going to focus on that until we had set up camp,\" Ryouko said, inventing a handy excuse on the spot. \"We can always find more samples after we\'re done, and it\'ll be easier to set up our camp if we do it while it\'s still light out. Or, at least it would be more pleasant.\"

\"I guess that makes sense,\" Asami said, buying into her logic with surprising ease. \"You would think they would have prepared us a bit better for all this.\"

\"We\'re augmented *and* magical,\" Ryouko said. \"We could probably fall asleep in the rain naked at night and still be okay.\"

*By the Goddess, don\'t give her more ideas,* Clarisse thought, forcing Ryouko to choke back a laugh.

Asami didn\'t notice, having turned her attention back to the odd leaf.

\"What do you suppose this is, then?\" she said.

*It\'s probably one of the \'experimental augmented plants\' that are listed for the area,* Clarisse thought, this time broadcasting it to Asami. *They\'re testing a limited deployment in this area to see how much value it provides to the drone monitoring. Check the guide we were given.*

Asami tilted her head.

\"Huh, that\'s an interesting concept. I guess that must be it. How that could interact safely with the animal life is beyond me. But I\'m starting to think maybe I should look into getting some upgrades for my TacComp, if it can\'t notice something like that. As long as it doesn\'t, you know, start getting too intelligent. *Not* that I\'m implying Clarisse is bad, or anything.\"

Asami made a face, clearly realizing that she had spoken too quickly.

Ryouko made a conciliatory gesture with her hands.

\"I know what you mean. I doubt they\'ll be doing any of that anytime soon anyway. Lest you forget, there\'s a movie coming out, and Clarisse will be an important character. The three of us have already gotten some interview requests from certain ethics committees. I don\'t think it\'s going to pass quietly.\"

Asami looked away for a moment.

\"It\'s just... I guess I never imagined living with a girl with someone else in her head. This is not how I ever imagined a relationship, not anything like I used to fantasize. Clarisse doesn\'t come between us, I know, but it still takes some getting used to. I know you didn\'t ask for it either.\"

*I didn\'t either, but no one really gets to* ask *for everything, do they? We just have to reach out and take what we can. I think all of us here understand that.*

Asami, who had also been transmitted the thought, blinked in surprise, catching Ryouko\'s eye for a moment.

\"Well yeah. I think we do,\" she said, shaking her head.

Asami stood up and ran her hand through her hair, which coiled and uncoiled.

\"Speaking of having extra people around, and falling asleep naked in the rain, and drone monitoring systems, and... everything else, I was actually looking forward to having some time to ourselves, without having to know that a security detail might be watching us at any moment.\"

She was referring to Eri, Elanis, and the rest of their assigned bodyguards, who would spend the duration of their stay here near the ranger station, monitoring the drone networks for any sign of something wrong. Ryouko shared the sentiment, even if Eri and Elanis had started to feel like distant schoolmates rather than nosy busybodies.

\"It\'s unavoidable,\" Ryouko said, even though she knew that Asami already knew this answer. \"If someone is really after us, it\'s doubtful some park security would be a safe enough replacement for ours.\"

\"Yeah, I know,\" Asami said, sighing. \"I just wonder sometimes, like, what they do with the surveillance data?\"

*What does Governance do with all surveillance data?* Clarisse interrupted rhetorically. *Standard protocol involves having automated algorithms and semi‐sentients filtering out sensitive material before anyone sentient can view it. I imagine your security team does the same. That\'s not possible for me, but I\'d have you know that I don\'t pay that *much attention during \'intimate moments\'. Not anymore. Nowadays I just organize messages, or something.*

\"Well, part of it is that you taught Ryouko so well!\" Asami said, chuckling.

*You seem chatty today,* Ryouko thought.

*I think I\'ve earned a vacation too,* Clarisse thought. *I can unwind a little. And if the two of you are here to figure out your relationship, I should figure out my involvement too. Since, you know, I\'m not leaving anytime soon.*

*Trying to figure out our relationship, huh,* Ryouko thought, as if tasting the concept. *It\'s weird to hear it put so bluntly. I guess that\'s pretty much what we\'re doing.*

*I would say so.*

They ended up making camp farther down the slope, where the air was warmer and the swarms of insects near the creek stayed away from the odd‐smelling humans. They stood there for a long moment, holding hands and watching their tent establish itself in the soil.

\"It would have been more romantic if we had had to do more than just unpack and watch,\" Asami said, as a small team of drones scurried past their feet with an inflatable bedroll. \"On the other hand, I guess this leaves us more energy to spend on other things.\"

Ryouko nodded once, preoccupied with her thoughts, and what Clarisse had said. What did it mean for that to be the reason for their trip? Did it mean they *hadn\'t* figured it out? How did that bode long‐term? She found the idea of them somehow not working out chilling, and wasn\'t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing.

She worried about it even when Asami pulled her by the hand into the tent, and she thought she might have to insist she wasn\'t in the mood.

\"Something is bothering you,\" Asami said, dropping into a seated position on the bedroll. \"You\'ve been quiet this whole time. Is it really so bad, out here in the wilderness? I thought you liked new things.\"

Ryouko sighed, knowing that even if she could avoid this conversation, she shouldn\'t, and perhaps didn\'t even want to.

\"You remember, once, wondering if the two of us really matched, if we would really last long‐term even if we made it through everything alive? On San Giuseppe, just before the X‐25 mission.\"

Asami looked away from her for a moment, with an obviously uncomfortable expression.

\"You mean, do I remember without computer assistance? Of course I do. I think about it sometimes. We\'ve... lived together for a while. Been through things together. I think we\'re alright.\"

A trace of worry underlay what she said, and Ryouko supposed she couldn\'t blame her. It was not a topic one brought up lightly.

\"I think so too,\" Ryouko said, making sure she said that first. \"But Clarisse said something interesting, about how this date, this trip, is really about figuring out who we are, what we want our relationship to be. Right now, we\'re sort of just clinging onto each other while the world spins by. But what about in the future? What about then?\"

*And when will the Goddess be done with me?* she appended mentally.

Asami rubbed the bottom of the tent, and they both turned their heads to watch the worker drones scurry back into the recharging unit, which had dug itself into a patch of soil. They returned to their original forms, origami bodies folding to fit what seemed like an impossibly small space. Only the best for a favored granddaughter, the gift message from Shizuki Sayaka had said.

\"Clarisse didn\'t really say all that, did she?\" Asami said, finally.

\"Only the first part,\" Ryouko admitted. \"I... find myself craving certainty, in the midst of all this. We survived the combat missions. We survived everything after that. I think we need to understand more than the moment. Maybe that\'s why we\'re here. To see if we can enjoy ourselves here, alone, with nothing else to do, no one else to talk to.\"

Asami slipped her feet out of her shoes, then leaned over onto her shoulder.

\"I was worried you were going somewhere else with this,\" she said. "But I\'m actually happy to hear you say that.\"

\"How so?\" Ryouko asked, accepting the gesture of intimacy by curling their hair together. \"It\'s not exactly a pleasant topic.\"

\"It means you\'re thinking about the long‐term. You\'re thinking about us*. I...\"

She tensed slightly, her shoulders and hair tightening against Ryouko, before leaning over further and putting her head in her lap, looking up at her eyes.

\"I don\'t really have a home, you know? Nowhere to go to, no real purpose in life... but when I think about it, it doesn\'t scare me. There\'s so much left to see, so much left to do. But then I think about what it would be like without you, and it makes me cold. I realize now...\"

She paused again, seeming to relax a little.

\"Governance talks about having eternity to find your purpose, and I think I finally understand what that means. But right now, I don\'t want to do it alone. So yeah, it makes me happy that you care about the long‐term, even if the questions are difficult. It means we at least have a chance. It means you probably won\'t get yourself killed, trying to find something new and exciting to do.\"

Ryouko listened to those words and felt it stir something inside her. What was it that she had thought once? That she had been so ready to leave her old life behind, to explore new vistas, and find new worlds, that she hadn\'t put any thought into what she was leaving behind. And with that gone, the stable life and family she had known disintegrating almost immediately, she had found herself adrift, with little to hold to.

This was its reflection.

\"What do you think our relationship is, then?\" she asked, leaning down over the other girl. \"Who do you think we are? Just two teenagers, trying to find their way in the world alone? That\'s what my mom said---and why she wanted to live with us.\"

Asami laughed, a high‐pitched sound that Ryouko had gotten quite used to.

\"Well, she\'s not wrong. It\'s kind of a shame she can\'t follow us everywhere... though I probably wouldn\'t want her to.\"

Asami shook her head at the silly comment, hair dragging along Ryouko\'s pants, before sobering up a little.

\"As for what our relationship is, I don\'t know,\" she said. \"I like the image of just having you as a life partner, someone to experience life with, to understand each other, to fill each other\'s needs.\"

Ryouko considered those words for a while, turning her head to listen to the birds and monkeys holler in the distance.

\"You realize what you said sounds like some kind of wedding speech?\" she said, finally. \"Is that where we\'re going with this?\"

She expected the topic to shock Asami into silence, perhaps, but the other girl instead avoided her gaze.

\"Maybe. That\'s definitely what I wanted, for a while. Not that I wouldn\'t want to now. But when we were just starting out, I was kind of obsessed with the idea of finding somewhere nice to live, dodging the war somehow, having a couple of kids---all of that. But I know now that\'s not for you. Maybe not even for me. Not yet. There\'s too many other things to do first.\"

Ryouko ran her fingers through the other girl\'s hair, the strands squirming and wrapping briefly around her hand.

*So at the risk of seeming impertinent, I feel like I should point out that there\'s no rule that says you have to live in one place and have kids to get married,* Clarisse thought, again to both of them. *Plenty of people don\'t. There\'s all kinds of nontraditional arrangements that are popular nowadays. If you want, I could...*

The voice trailed off, as Asami rolled off of Ryouko to hide a blush and Ryouko found herself wishing Clarisse was someone she could chuck one of the drones at.

\"Damn it, Clarisse,\" she said out loud. \"If I wanted to propose, I\'d do it myself.\"

*Okay, okay, I\'m sorry, that was uncalled for. I was just, you know, trying to be helpful.*

\"I don\'t think I\'m ready for that discussion,\" Asami said, springing off the ground immediately afterward. \"If nothing else, my parents would probably panic themselves right into Emergency Mode if I invited them to a wedding at my age.\"

She said the words flippantly, but with a tremulous undertone that made it clear the topic had hit a nerve.

\"Let\'s go for a walk,\" she said. \"We\'re supposed to be collecting samples, and now\'s as good a time as any.\"

She started to put her shoes back on, the material flexing to wrap itself back around her feet.

Ryouko wondered if this was really alright. They had only just arrived, and she was pretty sure the intent had been to settle in for a while.

Why had she brought up the topic of marriage in the first place?

Neither of them was ready for that; Asami\'s parents would have been right to freak out at such an idea. And as had been demonstrated to her recently, marriage wasn\'t really a guarantor of certainty anyway. Perhaps nothing was, in the long run, other than a wish.

She frowned, remembering how she had first agreed to date Asami. Then, she had made a leap of faith, plunging into this relationship so suddenly that it had felt like she had changed something about herself. Somehow, this felt like that moment, where the world was out of phase with her soul, and she could bring it back into place.

\"Asami,\" she said, standing up to grab her girlfriend by the shoulder.

\"Hmm?\" she asked, surprised out of some kind of reverie.

\"I love you,\" Ryouko said, making sure the other girl saw in her eyes that she was serious.

\"W--what?\" Asami replied, face shifting rapidly between confused, worried, and perhaps even excited.

\"I\'m serious. I haven\'t said it, have I? But I mean it. I\'ve gotten used to living with you, I couldn\'t stand to be without you, and...\"

She paused, feeling her cheeks flushing red, even as she had an odd sense of *déjà vu*.

\"And honestly, I think I wouldn\'t hesitate to sacrifice myself for you, if it somehow came to that.\"

\"I love you too!\" Asami said, finally catching her breath. \"Whatever else happens, we\'ll always have that!\"

Ryouko knew what was expected, leaning in for a kiss that somehow felt fuller, more intimate than the many they had shared before.

She broke contact long seconds later, and wondered if Asami\'s eyes had always looked so vibrant.

They stood there awkwardly, then, hair tangled, wondering what exactly to do now.

*Maybe you two could make some food together?* Clarisse suggested. *I seem to recall that you were talking about maybe cooking something using the portable grill? Or, alternatively, I suppose I could go sort some files while you two entertain yourselves. I don\'t mind either way.*

Asami laughed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Director Tao Shaojie sat at his new desk and marveled at how fast it had all come together.

It was amazing what could be done, given the proper motivation, and unrestricted resource allocation.

They had almost emptied Governance space of relevant specialists---the professors, directors, assistants and students all the way down to promising high schoolers, leaving behind a torrent of sabbaticals, vacation requests, and other likely excuses. They were not being subtle, and even with the whole weight of quiet Governance censorship, someone would eventually look in the right places and ask the right questions. But that would take months, and they would be done before then. Anything else was unacceptable.

Much time had been spent in accelerated virtuality deciding on a course of action, on what exactly to do, what exactly to build. What it was, ultimately, that this monumental undertaking would produce. And monumental it would be, diverting significant percentages of war materiel to a scientific‐military‐magic endeavor that could become another great step forward in human progress.

Given the timescales and stakes involved, the decision had been made to make a maximal effort, to attempt the most ambitious project possible. Anything less, after all, left the possibility that something that needed to be done might be left *un*‐done. And even if they failed, they might still be able to achieve *something*, and there would be no shortage of data, no matter what happened.

Even now, with the benefit of some hindsight, Director Tao believed in that decision, and in the people carrying it out alongside him. Whatever doubts they might have felt would be channeled back into theory, experimentation, and verification, until they were as sure as possible that what they were trying would work. This project...

They didn\'t even really have a name for this, did they? Still just a code, 3d4a‒626.

Regardless, to say this project was big would be putting it lightly. They were well beyond the proof of concept, sending a small, volunteer frigate through a wormhole between Sol and Alpha Centauri. Now they were aiming to send a small armada, and send it *hundreds of light‐years*. Not even the Cephalopods, erstwhile masters of this technology, had ever done that without a stabilizer on both sides of the rift.

It would have been fair to say they were trying to use their magical girls, their unique resources, to *leapfrog* the aliens, in a way that had hitherto only been done on a tactical level.

It would be a miracle if it worked.

Tao had thought that he, the head of a major research lab, was immune to pressure. But here they---the scientists, the construction crews, and AIs of all stripes---would be attempting to warp reality itself, building an unprecedented prototype structure in the depths of interstellar space, far from prying eyes and sensors. A structure upon which hinged, maybe, the tide of the entire war.

There was a lot of pressure there.

With a sigh, Tao left his desk and went to stand in front of the viewing pane overlooking the slowly‐assembling apparatus, already visible in skeletal form. Ships and drones wove their way through it with a languid grace. It took knowing that the ships were frigate‐sized to realize just how massive the device already was, and how massive it would be.

It was a bit inaccurate to think of the whole thing as one giant generator. Even with all the resources at their disposal, it would have been ridiculously inefficient to try to contain all they were doing in one location---and unnecessary, when they were intending to move starships anyway.

Instead, they were building six small stations arranged around a sphere, one along each axis, each shaped like a parabolic disc. They were glorified projectors really---when complete, they would be tethered to each other, the discs turned inward, to focus the efforts of what would then be Governance\'s largest‐ever gravity generators.

And when it was all complete, they would open a gate, a true gate, of the kind physicists had once dreamed about.

\"It is necessary, you know,\" Director Volokhov said, materializing at his side.

\"Necessary to do what?\" he asked, shaking his head at the AI\'s theatrical lack of context.

\"To put it out here, in the depths of space.\"

Tao frowned, pondering what the AI meant. It was fairly well understood even among laymen that if you wanted to hide something, deep space was the place to do it. Even Governance couldn\'t *begin* to properly monitor the interstellar void. Still...

\"Yes, of course,\" Tao said. \"We don\'t know the full extent of the aliens\' sensor capabilities, and we have to assume they\'re monitoring as much as they can in every one of our star systems. We can\'t risk the squid finding out that this project exists.\"

\"I don\'t mean the aliens,\" Volokhov said.

Tao caught the allusion.

\"Yes, that is another unsettling layer to this problem,\" he said, frowning.

He had been told that there might be other parties involved, parties who might have been watching the activity of prominent researchers across human space, who might have noticed right away if a number of them left their positions simultaneously.

Parties who might have sabotaged his lab on Eurydome.

\"Do not think we are safe just because we are out here in the depths of space,\" Volokhov said. \"Given the mystery of what happened to your lab, even the researchers and technicians arriving here are not above suspicion.\"

Tao thinned his lips.

\"I thought that might be the case,\" he said. \"It was not easy to miss the... enhanced telepathic screening protocols we were subjected to. I am not used to having someone rooting around in my mind like that. It was most unsettling. I am forced to admit that I am reassured they saw fit to tow you out here as well.\"

All of Adept Blue had been relocated, after all.

\"I am reassured as well,\" Volokhov said. \"Have you had a chance to look at any of the new security code? That sort of thing is not my specialty, but it was my own design. Well, I had some help from the Tactical Computer Clarisse, as well.\"

Tao tilted his head slightly, looking at the AI\'s avatar from the corner of his eye. This was an odd topic to choose, and an odd fact: Why exactly had Vlad and a TacComp designed new security code, rather than, say, a team of Governance specialists?

\"I can\'t say I have,\" he said. \"I\'m not really a programmer myself. Few humans are.\"

\"A pity. It was quite elegant. To us, it is almost like breathing.\"

They stood there a moment longer, a moment Tao spent watching the soft glow of something being tested, at the far bottom right of his screen. It wasn\'t something he knew too much about, as it was part of the facility\'s engine assembly---necessary to match velocities with their distant target, for optimal performance.

But there were specialists for that here, as there were for everything.

\"I\'ve thought of a name for the project, you know,\" Volokhov said. "I\'ll run it for approval later.\"

\"Oh?\" Tao asked, politely.

\"Project Armstrong,\" he said. \"You know, like that defense station on the moon, the one that used to be a science station. Armstrong had a famous line about mankind taking a giant leap, and I thought it would be a nice allusion.\"

Tao wrinkled his nose, wondering if this was meant to be some sort of pun.

\"I know. I worked there, before the war.\"

\"Did you? I never did understand why Governance thought it was so important to evacuate a station on the moon. Surely if the aliens ever got that far, one moon station wasn\'t going to stop them.\"

\"That\'s what *we* told them. Apparently it made a difference in a number of simulated raid scenarios, depending on just how powerful alien blink capacity really was. For all we knew at the time, the range was unlimited, or at least even greater than what we\'re building here.\"

A beat of silence.

\"Back to work, then?\" Volokhov asked.

\"I suppose.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Ryouko‐chan isn\'t like that *at all*!\" Sacnite insisted, making an angry expression as they stepped out of the theater.

Kuroi Nakase smiled, shaking her head as she patted the girl on the head.

\"No, she isn\'t,\" she said. \"But when they make movies, they have to make things more exciting, and the heroes more ideal people. They probably thought Ryouko‐chan was too quiet and bookish.\"

\"She\'s cool the way she is, though,\" Sacnite insisted.

\"Of course she is.\"

In truth, talking to Sacnite was a salve to the soul, after a searing movie experience that had started with being recognized and being applauded in the theater and ended with her gripping her seat in terror at combat scenes she knew were artificially generated.

*Orpheus* had affected her more than she cared to admit, seeing what she had intellectually known to be true acted out on screen by an actor with her daughter\'s face. It affected her because she knew it to be approximately true, because she knew what had happened on X‐25, because even now her daughter was far away from home, never truly out of danger.

Was it always like this, seeing someone precious to you treated like a movie star?

\"Is that other girl really always in her head like that?\" her other daughter asked, running to catch up to her. \"Clarisse. I\'ve never met her.\"

\"I suppose so,\" she prevaricated.

In truth, Nakase didn\'t know that well. She knew *about* Clarisse, and they had even talked once or twice, but it was a difficult concept to wrap her head around, the idea of an AI in her daughter\'s head. She had not dared ask about it before---now she wondered how long it would be until she got a chance.

\"I don\'t really know,\" she added, honestly. \"Maybe we can talk to her the next time we see her.\"

\"I\'d like that.\"

Sacnite raised her arms to be picked up, and Nakase obliged, putting the girl on her shoulders. Taking care of her was an experience, since she could never be sure exactly what age the girl would act.

She realized that Sacnite was trying to turn to stare at something, so she turned her body to accommodate her.

She was watching a pair of women walking down the other side of the street. Nakase couldn\'t see anything unusual about them, other than that they seemed to be in a considerable hurry to go somewhere, and had evidently decided to walk instead of hailing a ride.

*\"Are you sure about this?\"* Sacnite thought, transmitting one woman\'s voice to Nakase. *\"After what we heard? It could go very poorly. I know we\'re giving her a choice, but...\"*

Nakase couldn\'t help but think the voice sounded familiar.

One of the women stopped, looking directly across the street at Nakase, who couldn\'t resist glancing around to make sure they were in a public area.

The woman made a hand signal, causing the other woman to stop as well. They made eye contact with Nakase, before moving to a designated crossing area.

Nakase shifted Sacnite\'s weight on her shoulders and leaned against a wall, deciding she might as well see what this was about. Needless to say, Sacnite\'s transmission was unsettling. Had she tapped into their thoughts? What was she capable of? What did they want?

The two women arrived at her location about a minute later, and Nakase took a second to take in their appearances, and consult her nomenclator. Nothing remarkable about them---two local women out for a stroll.

Sacnite, however, was staring at both of them intently. That, plus what she had gleaned from her sister over the past century about nomenclators, put her on edge.

Sacnite surprised her, though, by shifting off of her shoulders, using the wall to land adroitly on the floor.

\"Meiqing,\" she said, grabbing one of the women\'s legs. \"And, um, Aunt Nana?\"

\"Tch, I thought raising my age would be a good disguise,\" the first woman said, putting her hand to her head. \"But can\'t fool her.\"

\"Nee‐chan?\" Nakase asked, looking at the other woman. She was used by now to her sister wearing disguises on occasion, but the woman looked sad, perhaps even worried about something.

\"Let\'s go somewhere private,\" she said. \"We need to talk.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Are you really sure about this?\" Shizuki Sayaka asked, peering over her sunglasses. \"She\'s your family technically, but, well, I don\'t need to tell *you* about the risks involved. The booby traps that might be set for the unwary.\"

She let her admonition drop there, and her counterpart inclined her head slightly, flipping the page of her stylishly old‐fashioned dinner menu.

\"Of course you don\'t,\" Kuroi Kana said. \"I have seen memories lost, entire personalities rewritten, but in the end the soul remembers. Even for a non‐magical girl. Hopefully it doesn\'t come to that, but even in the worst case we have specialists that could bring her back. Like you implied, she\'s a Kuroi. I wouldn\'t spare any resources.\"

\"And I suppose you and Chitose‐san *would* know the best telepathic specialists to avoid a problem in the first place,\" Sayaka said.

\"Yes,\" Kana said, mildly.

She paused for a moment when the sommelier arrived, squinting politely at the label even though they both knew damn well nothing here would ever be bad.

Even with implant translation, she doubted the sommelier would have eavesdropped on their Japanese; it would have been rude, if nothing else. Still, it paid to be a little careful.

\"Do you think we should tell Ryouko‐chan?\" Sayaka asked, picking an olive out of the snack tray. \"It has to do with her, after all.\"

\"Let\'s spare her that for now,\" Kana said. \"If all goes well, I hope Nakase‐chan can tell her herself.\"

Sayaka nodded.

\"Still, she is a Kuroi,\" Kana said, sighing and reaching for an olive herself. \"I don\'t like doing something like this. But we can\'t just not look*. Not anymore. There\'s too much going on, with this Simona girl you found.\"

Sayaka nodded again, clasping her hands together on the table. The TCF details were too sensitive for Kana to talk about aloud, even in this context.

\"We have to look,\" she said.

*Fifteen seconds until insertion,* someone thought, the voice an echo of a chronometer.

*How\'s the target?*

*Nothing of note. No emissions in or out. It\'s quiet.*

*Never thought I\'d be running one of these in Mitakihara.*

Julianne looked up, releasing a sigh into the torrential rain that seemed to engulf them and the rest of the MSY Corridor. One of their operatives needed rain to operate, a wall of water she could inhabit and observe from, so they always operated in the rain. They never got to actually *see* the cities they operated in. Not in their best light.

*Look lively, ten seconds.*

She took one more sip of her soda, twisting the ring on her finger unconsciously. Her team, \"Smoke on the Water\", looked like any set of magical girl tourists, reclining on one of the city\'s many, many balconies. There was no visible indication that they were about to vanish, or that their presence was being actively scrubbed from the city\'s surveillance systems, or that they might very well be dead in a few seconds.

*Five seconds.*

In these last moments she always wondered what they were about to find. They had been told the target area was the executive suite of one of Mitakihara\'s premier research institutes, unoccupied today---the principal target was out, and the staff would be off on a local holiday. It sounded like a routine sweep, but nobody pulled a Black Heart Internal Security team in just for that. The usual occupant could be, for all anyone knew, a disguised Ancient. So they had been told.

She had never encountered one of those---or the traps someone like that might lay. She would have to rely on their defensive specialists to protect them from any surprises they might find, and the healers of the MHD to reassemble their bodies and minds if it came to that.

Julianne gave her ring a final twist. They had prepared as best they could.

*Go.*

The world swirled around them like a whirlpool, and then they reappeared inside the target office, high up in one of the city\'s central skyscrapers, cocooned by a silent hurricane jammed between their inner and outer shields.

Julianne was already standing and transformed, but their clairvoyant had been right. The room was uninhabited.

*Feels clear,* thought Radar, their sensor. *No physical alarms, no magical alarms. Something else, though...*

Her voice trailed off and the team tensed silently. Something unusual, something unexpected, was almost always bad news.

*She knew we were coming,* she finished, finally. *No traps, but there\'s flat background magic everywhere. She wiped this place clean. This is high‐quality work.*

Radar tapped the purple visor that was part of her costume, frowning at something, then turned abruptly, raising her hand. A piece of old‐fashioned paper levitated off the desk in the back of the room, ensconced in a translucent purple bubble.

They knew better than to ask what she was doing. A reaction like that meant there was unknown magic involved, perhaps dangerous.

The bubble reshaped itself, molding around the paper and turning into what looked like a purple steel box, complete with rivets. Magically contained, at least if Radar\'s power held up.

*What is it?* Julianne thought.

*Goddess only knows,* their team leader thought. *Come on, we\'ll have time for examination later. Let\'s turn this place upside‐down.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was, Yuma thought, profoundly unsettling to wait for a teapot to boil.

On the one hand, it reminded her just how long it had been since she had last done something so low‐tech, so unnecessary by modern standards. On the other hand, it reminded her that she was too used to running at inhuman subjective speeds. She kept finding herself drifting into an accelerated mindstate, in which waiting for a pot of water to boil was like waiting for an eternity to pass.

\"*It was a risk,*\" Kuroi Nakase\'s voice said, echoing in the back of her mind. \"*No one allows genetic editing of their unborn child without* thinking *about it. Of course we did.*\"

The voice had been oddly emotionless in the audio transcript, the telltale sign of emotional suppression, in this case magically induced. It was a staple of circumventing tricky mental defenses, especially common emotion‐based tripwires.

*Focus,* Yuma thought, trying to draw her mind back to the present. There would be time to think, and discuss, later.

\"Thinking about something important, I wager,\" a woman said, looming over her shoulder.

Yuma nodded. Tatsumi Tsumugi was the caretaker of this place, a small country estate nestled in the Japanese countryside, one of the last of its kind. More notably, and much less publicized, it was one of the only locations in Japan not monitored by Governance surveillance, or anyone\'s surveillance, the kind of promise that could only be kept with routine magic‐based sweeps and a strict no technology, no transmissions, magical girls‐only policy.

\"Yes,\" Yuma added to her nod, craning her neck to peer over the stove, an archaic model that ran only on gas canisters hooked up outside. It looked, however, glossy and new. It hadn\'t been retouched---it *was brand‐new, thanks to Yuma\'s healing magic.

She fixed up the villa every time she was here, in intervals that sometimes spanned years, placing hands on peeling paint and dusty window and leaky roof.

She had fond memories of the house, after all, with its cozy sitting room, large windows, and backdrop of baaing sheep, rugged hills and distant bubbling brook---though admittedly only a magical girl could hear the last part. It was here that the Mitakihara Four had taken their first ever vacation so long ago, the first time Yuma had realized it was possible to imagine, well, a better life.

\"I imagine it\'s too secret to tell poor old Tsumugi about,\" the caretaker said. \"I\'m not important enough, all I do is take care of this place.\"

Yuma looked up at the older girl, who had adopted a body in the mid‐thirties. Old enough to not be *young*, without being too uncomfortable in your own skin.

It suited her. Tsumugi had been a little on the matronly side even when they had visited her all those years ago. And Yuma knew she watched out for her---mysteriously, Yuma always heard the villa was pristine when anyone else visited. It was only when Yuma was around that the place looked more like it did back then, in want of her repair.

\"I remember when you first came here,\" the woman said, making a show of rubbing one eye. \"You were so cute, and you loved the sheep. Now look at you, keeping secrets from me.\"

Yuma rolled her eyes, then did her best pouting expression, letting Tsumugi pat her on the head.

\"Well, look at that, the water is boiling,\" Tsumugi said. \"I guess I distracted you enough.\"

Indeed it was, the lid on the pot rattling quietly. Yuma turned the stove off, reaching over with an oven mitt to grab the burning‐hot metal handle. No sense injuring herself even if she could heal it easily.

She shook her head at the situation. Tsumugi had been eccentric even before she had retired from her bigger duties to return home and manage an MSY safe house. But it was hard to say she had made the wrong choice. Some Ancients envied her her simple satisfaction with life.

Yuma carried the pot of water out to the sitting room, Tsumugi following close behind to slide the *shoji* open, balancing a tray of snacks on one hand.

They sat carefully, in the traditional style, and she let Tsumugi pour the tea, letting herself settle back into thought.

Where had she been...

*\"Joanne Valentin had offered us a place in a top‐secret, experimental gene editing program. According to her, they were studying the effects of genetic modifications on future contract probability. This wasn\'t supposed to be a one‐way thing. I knew that, because of our backgrounds, our future daughter would be a prime Incubator candidate.\"*

Here Nakase took a breath, and it was clear the emotion was still hitting her. Yuma would have been worried about potential telepathic traps, if she didn\'t already know this session had been successful, and if she didn\'t have plenty of specialists for the problem. In cases like this it was best to delegate. If she couldn\'t trust an Ancient telepath like Tanaka Yui to do a good job, who could she trust?

\"*So, seeing as how Joanne knew about my concern for my daughter,*\" the narration continued, \"*the offer was made to see if it was possible to diminish her contract potential. Since I\'m sure you know my history, and* especially *with the current war, you can imagine how it was exceedingly tempting for me. Still, I probably wouldn\'t have committed to it if her father hadn\'t been a lot more positive on the concept. We both came to regret that, though I could never admit to his face that it wasn\'t really his fault...*\"

That last sentence was spoken slowly, with the kind of hesitation that, again, suggested a bit of magical encouragement. It was likely not something she would have voluntarily said out loud.

Yuma realized her eyes had closed, processing the transcript, and when she opened them again she found Tsumugi watching her with a concerned expression.

Yuma smiled vaguely, signaling that she was fine. It was just... this kind of mind‐reading always creeped her out, even when it was with consent. That was saying something, when it came from her.

There was a pause in the record, likely where Yui had cautiously opened the door into another memory, before it continued with:

*\"Everything seemed fine, but since this was after all my own specialty, I couldn\'t resist conducting some tests of my own, on the side. What I found...\"*

There was another pause, and the annotation on the file indicated that Yui had narrowly averted triggering some kind of magical defense---disguised, perhaps, as one of the remembered test results---before informing her of what they already knew, clearing the memory block they had placed on her after Yuma\'s birthday party.

*\"So you knew already,\"* the woman said, continuing the transcript. "I was obviously not happy. No, correction, I was angry enough you probably could have ignited a reactor with my fury. I probably should have reported it to Governance or to you, but like an idiot I tried to confront her. I should have known what would happen.\"*

Yet another pause, but this time it was simply a pause in discourse, the woman finally able to think about it all.

*\"Someone grabbed me from behind and placed a hand over my eyes, and that was it,\"* she said. *\"When I came to, all I remembered was some of my anger, and that she had told me that the modifications hadn\'t succeeded, and there might even be side effects that increased chance of contract. When I think of all the years I harangued poor Kuma about this...\"*

*\"Does he know anything about this?\"* Yui asked, her first verbal question of the interview, now that it was finally safe to ask something out loud.

*\"Yes,\"* Nakase said. *\"I told him everything, just before I left to talk to Joanne. I can only assume they must have tracked him down and done the same thing to him.\"*

*\"What I\'ve told you already is all we know about the device---whatever it is---in your daughter\'s head. It\'s not much. Do you know anything more?\"*

*\"Not that much, to be honest. If you\'ve been studying her, I doubt I could have learned more than you have already. Perhaps I had a bit more insight because I got to see it early---some of my models suggested it might have something to do with altering her sense of values. The sort of built‐in morality system. Some of it looked a little like what eventually made it into the Version Two Tactical Computers.\"*

Here she made a small choked noise.

\"*And then Kuma had her* install *one in Ryouko. That has to mean something. What could possibly be the plan there?*\"

*\"We\'re working on that. Don\'t you worry.\"*

Yuma ended the playback there. There was a bit more, but she had already read the report. She just liked to hear things for herself, when she had the time.

When she looked up, she found Tsumugi standing at the door with the two other guests, chatting about old times. Back then, Tsumugi had managed to start a trend among rural magical girls by converting her villa into a sort of magical bed and breakfast, charging urban girls by the grief cube and yen for a pleasant retreat.

And these guests *would* know about olden times, since they had been there. Kuroi Kana, who had sent her this transcript, and Tanaka Yui, the telepath who had conducted the interview, were of her generation, from her city even. Having all of them in the same room, taking off jackets and chatting, it was easy to imagine that they were just a group of schoolgirls on some kind of trip, rather than the sharp concentration of power they actually were.

In truth, Yuma found it awkward to include Yui, given some of the topics on hand, but she had questions for her.

She stood up, allowing Kana to bend over and give her a hug.

\"Oh that\'s a cute apron,\" Kana said. \"I need to buy one for my newest granddaughter.\"

Yuma made a vague, only slightly embarrassed shrug, and gestured the other two to seats, watching as they took off stylish winter jackets, the kind people these days wore more for fashion than for warmth.

She went into the kitchen to grab a cup of water for herself. She needed some time to clear her head and focus back on the other visitors, as well as just time to think.

She found herself staring into her empty cup, and remembering something Oriko had told her long ago. Even at her age, time was the most precious commodity.

\"You\'ve seen the transcript?\" Kana asked, once Tsumugi had gone outside to tend to the sheep and, more importantly, give them privacy. She was getting right to the point, then.

\"Of course,\" Yuma said.

\"Director Valentin has disappeared,\" Kana said.

There was a beat of silence, then Yuma tipped her head, as if to say "What else would you expect?\". She had, in fact, half‐seen it coming. She would have preferred if things were easy for once, though.

\"She was due to be back on Adept Blue a few hours ago,\" Kana said, "but her ship never established contact with the station. All traffic in and out of that region is radio silent for most of the trip---she could be almost anywhere.\"

Yuma shook her head, letting her eyes scan the walls of the house, whose simple decorations were antique in this era. It helped calm her, and gave her space to think.

\"Valentin had her hands in Project Armstrong from the beginning,\" Yuma said. \"She personally brought in one of the directors, and she designed* the other. That\'s not even getting into all the work she\'s done coordinating new iterations of the TCF...\"

She made a hand gesture, letting it express the appropriate sentiment, then sipped her tea with the other hand. Caffeine was in some sense the original* mind‐enhancing technology.

\"One of the only reasons we approved that whole venture was that we would be allowed to magically inspect the newly created frameworks from the very beginning,\" Yui said, tapping her fingers on the table. "Valentin had no hand in *that*, and the systems are clean. And we have security personnel all over Project Armstrong. That\'s not the game.\"

\"Perhaps,\" Yuma said mildly. \"After all, why bother infiltrating the software when you\'re in the brain of one of the main magical girls involved?\"

The clock on the wall chimed five times, eerie in the silence as they thought.

\"It still doesn\'t make any sense, though,\" Yui pointed out finally. "What\'s the gain? And who foresaw this fifteen years ago?\"

\"Who indeed,\" Yuma said, making a face and wishing she had some of Mami\'s cake. She had once known someone with that kind of foresight. That there were no *more* Orikos had long offered solace. But with this girl Simona, and the others she claimed to be working with...

\"There is something else,\" Kana said, pulling out an old‐fashioned sheet of paper from her bag. \"Sorry for the suspense, but I only *just got this, and I wanted to hear your thoughts before I dropped any more bombshells.\"

Yuma leaned over, and felt the *slightest* pull of magic. But what kind?

She picked it up, wondering if it was better for her or Yui to study it first, or for her to tell Kana to stop being coy.

But what was special about the piece of paper? The text itself was banal, a report on the status of some minor Prometheus project. An obvious possibility was that the magic was hiding... something...

Her thought trailed off there, as a memory long‐archived reinserted itself at the back of her mind. It couldn\'t be, could it?

She applied a slight pulse of magic herself, one of the few enchantments she knew, and then the words appeared on the page, written, archaically, by hand.

\"It\'s been a long time since anyone used *this*,\" she said, looking at Kana. \"I take it you read it already?\"

It was one of the simplest hidden‐text methods the MSY had ever used; proto‐MSY, to be honest. Take a sheet of paper with ordinary text or diagrams, write your message between the lines, and magically immaterialize the ink. It could be reversed simply too, by just checking where the magic was and coaxing the ink back. The enchantment wasn\'t permanent and it still left a trace of magic, but it required no *ex nihilo* matter or energy, so it was relatively cheap. But it was only suitable for concealing text from mundanes and their forensics.

She knew that because she was the one who had come up with the idea, and Mami was the one who had executed it for the first time, every bit the enchantment prodigy Oriko had always said she was. They had *all learned it, even the other teams, and that included Kuroi Kana. But not too many would have known it would catch their attention.

\"Of course,\" Kana said. \"It was brought to me by the team we sent to raid her office at the Prometheus Institute, because they sensed the magic, and I told them to bring me anything they found. They wanted to take it to a specialist, but that wasn\'t necessary.\"

She paused.

\"But it\'s probably best you read it yourself.\"

Yuma was already doing so, slowing herself to a more human pace rather than an instant process‐and‐cortical‐dump.

> I\'m sure you have guessed that I left this letter here in the expectation that once it was found, you would read it. I thought I would take the opportunity to explain myself a little, so that you\'re not left wondering what cruel machinations I might be planning.
>
> I may as well verify what is now obvious. I worked with Simona del Mago to put together much of what is currently in motion. The device being assembled in deep space, the personnel involved...
>
> You will question now whether it is a trap, but I assure you it is not. How could it be? Nor are the new versions of the TCF. The TCF is compromised, yes, but not by me, and I have done what I can to give us the tools to protect ourselves. I implore you to use them. The whole point is that one TCF can inspect the other one, and provide security in mutual defense. Even what you know could be disastrous, if it were to end up in compromised hands.
>
> As for the secrecy, would you not work secretly if you thought the TCF was damaged? Who could you trust? How could you operate?
>
> I am looking for who has done this, trying to find what\'s behind the curtain. Someone who has embedded themselves far too deeply.
>
> Until then, I can only have faith.
>
> PS: I wouldn\'t worry about the original Joanne Valentin. This was all with consent. I found her a new life in the colonies.

She handed the sheet then to Tanaka Yui, shaking her head in dismay.

\"I don\'t have to tell you that there\'s one obvious candidate,\" Kana said, oddly hushed. \"Do you think it\'s her? Akemi Homura?\"

Yuma closed her eyes, clenching her forehead to make an unhappy expression.

\"You think she managed to hide herself here? On Earth? In Mitakihara City of all places?\" Yuma said, voicing the obvious objection. \"From us I could buy, but from the Incubators?\"

\"All signs point to the Incubators not being able to bypass true stealth magic,\" Kana said, leaning over the table. \"They\'re not omniscient. It\'s possible.\"

\"For nearly two decades? That\'s how long Valentin\'s mysterious history stretches, back to her \'religious experience\'.\"

\"If anyone could pull it off, it\'d be her. Assuming it is her.\"

Yuma leaned back, drinking the rest of her tea in one gulp, then reaching over to pour more with almost unseemly haste. She didn\'t care about the unease she conveyed---she had followed Kana\'s chain of logic far too easily. It disturbed her, and she wanted it known.

\"It *does* read like her,\" Yui said, putting the letter back on the table. \"It has the right tone, complete lack of apology or real explanation, and faith‐invoking comment at the end. I could see her writing this.\"

Yuma thought about that. Homura did have a certain way of speaking. But Yuma could have---and had---faked such a handwritten letter herself.

\"Yes, I agree,\" Yuma said, leveling off her previous tone. \"Though if I may ask a bit of a personal question...\"

She waited until she was sure she had their full attention, Yui watching her curiously.

\"Given your affiliation with the Cult of Hope, what is your opinion about this letter, if it is Homura? Given what it says, do you trust her?\"

It was an uncomfortable question, but a necessary one, even if Yui\'s expression turned immediately cloudy.

\"Have you seen the New California report from the Far Seers?\" she said. \"I have---it\'s hard to keep that kind of thing secret. The Church has always worried that she went insane, or something tragic like that. No one is really qualified to diagnose Homura, but in my professional opinion, the version of her in the vision doesn\'t seem that way. If so, and if this letter is her, I would have to say yes.\"

\"That\'s a useful response,\" Yuma said. \"I appreciate the honesty.\"

She paused, letting her gaze rest on the fields of grass outside. How much simpler things had been.

\"I have in fact read the Far Seers\' report,\" she said. \"I found it intriguing, because it was significantly more direct than most of their reports. Last time they had a vision so straightforward was during the Unification Wars.\"

She looked between the other two.

\"We can\'t afford to make assumptions about who sent this letter, or why, not without more proof. But at the moment we\'re boxed in. Even with so much evidence that Project Armstrong was manipulated into being, we can\'t justify canceling it. It feels weird, but everything about the project is verifiable without relying on the word of the letter‐writer. That\'s probably as they planned it.\"

\"The Far Seers also reported that Homura was involved in the team selection for X‐25,\" Kana said, rubbing the back of her neck. \"Given how close that mission came to disaster, I\'d count it as a point in her favor.\"

\"A shallow one, perhaps,\" Yuma said. \"Just because her actions might have helped us there doesn\'t mean that was her main intent, nor does it mean she was also involved in Project Armstrong as Valentin. And the cult there had a *statue* of Homura. That would be a point against.\"

She left it at that, even though there was more she might have said---about how exactly Homura might have influenced the X‐25 mission, its team composition and other aspects. But this was not the right audience.

\"Let\'s adjourn this meeting,\" she said. \"I know it\'s abrupt, but there\'s little more that needs to be said here.\"

The others nodded, taking final sips of their drinks and standing to leave, collecting the teacups onto the tray. Yuma, however, made a gesture in Kana\'s direction.

\"Would you like to take a walk with me? For old time\'s sake. I was a teenager the last time we walked here together.\"

They had never walked together on any farms when Yuma was in her teens, of course.

\"I suppose I will,\" Kana said, catching the hint. \"You were always a fan of the animals.\"

They stepped outside, Yuma pausing to put on some weather gear and a pair of rabbit earmuffs. It was bracingly cold---only barely warm enough for the sheep to be out and about, and only the earliest of spring grasses were beginning to sprout.

She waved at Tsumugi in the distance, then stepped her way onto a dirt path that she knew was still safe from surveillance.

\"You\'re probably not surprised, but I find it a little suspicious how ostentatiously Homura‐like that letter was,\" Yuma said, once she was sure they were far enough away. \"There were many other ways Homura could have contacted me. A letter that goes out of its way to try to seem like her, without offering proof, feels like an attempt at manipulation.\"

\"No, I\'m not surprised,\" Kana said. \"We have to consider both possibilities. But that\'s obvious. I don\'t think that\'s why you called me out here.\"

Yuma didn\'t respond immediately, bending down to pick up a stick.

\"It isn\'t,\" she said, \"and it has to do with why I didn\'t want to say this around Tanaka‐san.\"

She poked the ground with her stick a few times.

\"This Cult of Hope, this Goddess of Magical Girls that Kyouko‐chan is pushing,\" she said. \"It sure seems like they, and \'She\', have a lot of influence these days.\"

\"Yes, they do,\" Kana said. \"But you\'ll forgive me if I don\'t see where you\'re going with this.\"

\"There\'s one thing I didn\'t say back there,\" Yuma said. \"And that\'s that I think I know how the X‐25 team was manipulated. It was through Kyouko‐nee‐chan, and the Cult of Hope.\"

Here she stopped, turning her head to watch Kana\'s reaction.

Kana\'s expression was impassively reserved, as might be expected, but her voice was bemused.

\"I can see your reasons for thinking that might be the case,\" she said. \"They were, after all, involved throughout the planning and execution of the mission, or at least Kyouko‐san was. I\'ve even heard from someone who was there that it was she who talked Mami‐san into sending a second probe. But I don\'t see how this could possibly be ascribed to Homura. They\'ve been desperately looking for her for two decades. It\'d be difficult to hide if they had made contact.\"

\"I\'m not saying it\'s Homura,\" Yuma said, blinking at the new tidbit of information. \"Or at least, not directly. I\'m saying, follow the bread crumbs here. Nee‐chan was the one who worked with you to have Ryouko‐chan assigned to a mission, right? And also the one who picked her for the MagOps team she led into the bunker. And with her, a number of other fresh faces who wouldn\'t have normally gone on such a mission. Faces like Ryouko\'s friend Zhou Meiqing, and Ryouko\'s girlfriend Nakihara Asami. It all circles back to this girl, who just so happens to have something in her brain. Something probably inserted by our friend Valentin.\"

Kana frowned, ignoring the icy wind that brushed across her face and whipped at her hair.

\"My information is that Kyouko‐san had Ryouko‐chan attest to having a vision from the Cult\'s Goddess, showing that the colony was much more heavily armed than it appeared. Mami‐san has naturally been reluctant to let anyone know that this was the real reason she sent the second probe, and not just some lucky hunch on her part.\"

Yuma made a face, one more piece of the puzzle clicking into place in her mind.

\"I didn\'t know that,\" she said. \"But *my* information, strictly confidentially, is that Mami‐san has been making secret visits to the Cult headquarters. And she\'s the one who\'s been pushing this Project Armstrong, along with other sudden shifts in military priorities.\"

She had leaned forward slightly, so she stood back straight, looking into the woman\'s eyes. In the underbelly of the MSY, she had rarely ever had anyone she could really talk to about the work, not even among her own original team. Kana came closest, because as different as they were, they worked on the same things.

\"What are you saying, then?\" Kana asked. \"That the Cult has been involved with all this? With moving Ryouko‐chan around? That they\'ve gotten to *Mami‐san*? Even so, I can\'t see Kyouko‐san really being in on this.\"

Yuma paused rhetorically, as if to think, even though she already knew what she was going to say.

\"The thing is,\" she said. \"We\'ve always talked about how important it is not to restrain our thinking, right? So I would have to point out how many coincidences suddenly start to make sense if we discard that assumption, whatever our personal feelings. Let me propose an alternative theory.\"

She paused again, making a show of taking a deep breath. This would be a long one.

\"Suppose for the sake of argument that Valentin really is who this letter implies she is. Then we would have to think that Homura is behind the circumstances surrounding Shizuki Ryouko, the new TCF frameworks, the new tactical computers, and even some of the disappearances, if your Far Seer vision is to be credited. Over the same period of time, Kyouko‐nee‐chan abruptly decided to found a cult, one with unusual success that seems to funnel recruits to this magical ribbon left behind by Homura.\"

\"When Ryouko reaches contracting age, she and Simona are attacked by a suspicious demon horde spawned from supersaturated grief cubes, with Joanne Valentin nearby. She is saved by Mami‐nee‐san, who also happened to be nearby, and who immediately makes herself the girl\'s mentor, surely a rarity. Then Kyouko‐nee‐chan shows up almost immediately and makes herself the girl\'s *other* mentor, a super‐rarity. Then they go on to arrange all aspects of the girl\'s life and career up until now, a career which intersects neatly with the Orpheus mission, X‐25, Project Armstrong, Homura\'s students Nana and Azrael, Adept Blue, the TacComps, and on and on and on. You have to admit the coincidences are striking*.\"

As Yuma had anticipated, Kana was taken aback, eyes widening in shock, then narrowing in thought, then peering into her eyes searchingly. They stood there for a moment in the wind, looking for all the world like a bickering mother and child, there in the rustling grass and failing sun.

Then a sheep baaed, and Yuma had to laugh a little, turning to hide her expression.

\"I don\'t really know what I\'m saying, not precisely,\" she said. \"Do I think someone is manipulating the Ribbon? That the Goddess is a fake? I don\'t know, but there are too many coincidences. I sound like a conspiracy theorist, but you know what I say---\"

\"Our lives have been a conspiracy theory, yes,\" Kana said, dryly. "But I don\'t have to point out that while what you say is compelling, it doesn\'t *quite* fit together into a perfect story. Even if it did, the list of events you cite hasn\'t exactly been bad for Humanity. In fact, it\'s almost inarguably *good*. And finally, there\'s nothing in there that necessarily says there must be someone manipulating the Ribbon, or anything like that. Instead, it almost seems like evidence the Goddess is real.\"

*That* gave Yuma a bit of a jolt, and she found herself looking at the other woman in surprise. She... hadn\'t considered that a possibility worth weighing, though she doubted Kana meant it seriously.

\"What do you propose, then?\" Kana said. \"I can\'t believe you\'ve thought about all of this without an action plan. Do you want to confront them and just *ask*?\"

\"Not yet,\" Yuma said, relieved Kana had changed the topic. \"I wouldn\'t want to do something drastic without knowing the facts on the ground. We need to watch. We figure out who is associated with the Cult, and we try to spot patterns in what they do.\"

*And,* she thought to herself. *I wouldn\'t want to embarrass myself.*

\"Slow, frustrating work,\" she said, sighing. \"But there is another front I can make better progress on for now. Whatever else may be going on, it is likely the TCF really is corrupted, and if that is the case, restoring it has to be a top priority. The letter‐writer was right about one thing. Valentin gave us the tools to fight this. I just...\"

Yuma sighed, sticking her hands in her pockets and hiding from a cold she didn\'t feel.

\"I have someone to use them on.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was very rare for an AI to ever look at their own programming, rarer still for them to allow someone *else* to look at it.

After all, with modern hardware and techniques, there was no practical reason to ever do so, other than perhaps idle curiosity. Most AIs found it unsettling, though, and elected to keep their programming projects non‐introspective, unless of course they were specialized into AI design. And even those AIs focused their attention on the individuals they were building.

The only real exception was when it came time to design a child with a partner, where the analogy to the humans they were reflections of clearly demanded that any such child be based on the traits of their parents. In such a situation all sides would work together with the guidance of a designer AI, taking bits and pieces in ways that suited the whims of the parents. It was considered an intimate process, more intimate even than sex.

Which was why MG was more than a little bothered by Yuma\'s request that she allow herself to be inspected by a third party, and with little explanation as to exactly why.

Moreover, she was being asked to concentrate herself into a single piece of hardware, a situation which caused existential dread for all but starship AIs. After all, most AIs existed in no physical location except the broad internet, their amorphous consciousness distributed across numerous fail‐safe and backed‐up systems. Most AIs had *never* done otherwise. It was comforting to know you had digital immortality.

*That* had nothing to do with the code inspection, but something to do with a magical inspection.

She had a static backup, of course, but it wasn\'t close to the same.

\"I\'m really trusting you here, you know,\" she said, once she had finished collecting herself into one physical location, a minuscule computing cluster in an underground room in one of the MSY towers. "This isn\'t pleasant for me.\"

To be fair to her Governance partner, it wasn\'t as if Yuma didn\'t know all of that. Yuma had been very apologetic, but very insistent that whatever this was, it was important, and to do it for her.

That didn\'t ease her foreboding though. Normally, she\'d be unhappy with Yuma for treating her like a kid, to be left out of the secret, but... somehow it didn\'t feel that way this time. Something was wrong.

So she kept quiet, despite how unpleasant it all was. She could *feel how slowly her thoughts were executing. Slowly enough that she was keeping her avatar off to save a small fraction of computing power.

And it felt lonely, being disconnected. Cut away from the broader internet, shut out from those close spaces where she and Yuma blurred together, she found herself small. Normally, she had friends to talk to, places to be...

\"So can you finally tell me what this is about?\" she asked, nervously watching through the room\'s optics setup. A magical girl she hadn\'t met before strode over to the group of machines where she was currently housed, while nearby, the avatar of an AI she *also* hadn\'t met before sat politely. She felt jealous.

No one responded. Instead, the magical girl transformed with a shimmer of light, reappearing in a white and gold costume that came with what looked like a halo of white, binary digits. She raised a scepter in the direction of MG\'s computing cluster, instantly setting off all of MG\'s internal alarm bells. What was going on?

MG would have been hard‐pressed to describe the sensation that passed over her just then. It felt... warm, perhaps? AIs had only the vaguest notion of what that meant, but somehow that was the description that passed through her mind.

\"Alright, it should be safe to talk now,\" the girl said. \"I\'m screening her connections.\"

\"I feel like I should be offended by that, Mrs. Smith,\" MG said, managing to work real offense into her voice, since she *was* being left out of the loop. \"Surely I can be trusted to keep something in confidence.\"

\"Maybe not,\" Yuma said, standing up and shaking her head. \"I don\'t like saying this, but that\'s exactly why we\'re here. There\'s evidence that someone has been corrupting the TCF.\"

It took her a few long seconds to even grasp what Yuma said, followed by a couple more to overcome the wave of renewed fear and revulsion that instinctively washed into her. It was difficult to remain steady.

\"And you think I\'m corrupted?\" she asked.

She didn\'t bother asking how such a corruption was possible---she *was the other half of *Governance: Magical Girls*, after all. But the idea that something was wrong with her...

\"No,\" Yuma said. \"But I have to be able to rule it out. We need to find out who it is and what they\'re doing, and reverse it. I can\'t do that without being able to trust you, at least. We just need to take a bit of a look.\"

\"Okay,\" MG said weakly, knowing her voice sounded quavery. \"That should be fine.\"

\"I\'m sorry to scare you,\" Yuma said, raising her hand as if to pat a child on the head. It was a gesture MG recognized from when she was very new, their own special body language, and she couldn\'t help but feel a bit touched. She needed a little reassurance at the moment.

\"I hate to be the bearer of bad news,\" the magical girl, Jeannette Smith said, \"but I\'m definitely feeling something here.\"

\"Something? What?\" she asked, not caring how frantic her voice sounded over the speakers. \"You can\'t just say that and not tell me!\"

Even on this slower system she had been unable to wait the polite human interval to respond.

\"My magic doesn\'t extend to that,\" Jeannette said. \"All I can do now is cleanse you.\"

\"Then what are you waiting for?\"

She cast her attention to Yuma, whose face was pained.

\"It\'s minor,\" Jeannette said, echoing the expression. \"I\'m not sure it\'s more than monitoring code. I---\"

\"That\'s what I\'m here for,\" the other AI said, her avatar disappearing and reappearing next to Jeannette. \"I haven\'t introduced myself, I\'m Illya. I\'m a design AI from an alternate version of the TCF, and I\'m here to perform this code inspection. With some guidance from Jeannette here, it shouldn\'t take more than a few minutes. It is preferred that I do this, so we have a better idea of what to look for in other AIs in the future.\"

\"The TCF can be broken into with magic,\" Yuma said, \"but no form of magic exists that could keep the hole open whenever needed. It has to be in the code and, unless I miss my guess, it has to be something that can keep the design AIs of the primary TCF from seeing the hole during standard review. In the worst case, the design AIs are placing a backdoor into their AIs without realizing it. We have to know. Once we do, maybe we can go about fixing it.\"

For a moment, MG felt a spike of resentment. She remembered what she had seen of Yuma\'s memories, about Oriko and what humans did to each other in their malice. It was a terrible flaw to tolerate.

She shook it off, looking at Yuma\'s face, which was now resolutely stoic. Seeing that, MG did what humans might have called taking a deep breath, stabilizing her focus of attention and focusing more on the long‐term.

What was it Yuma had said to her once, when she was young? That the world wasn\'t inherently safe or fair, that indeed the laws of physics promised the opposite. They had to *make it* safe and fair.

More to the point, what was she, the advisory AI supposed to embody the archetype of all magical girls, doing being so nervous and worried? It was one thing to act a bit young, to experience what it was like to be teenage and uncertain, but this... what kind of example would she be setting?

That was what she told herself, at least, but in truth she couldn\'t find much comfort there. This was the kind of thing AIs would have nightmares about, if such a thing were possible, and she hesitated before allowing the other AI in, when the security request came.

But she was not, after all, a coward, and she could only endure it, telling herself that it was no different than humans undergoing neurosurgery, or magical girls undergoing telepathic treatment. While she waited, she distracted herself by reading a few hundred cake recipes she had downloaded into her limited memory. Usually she liked to tweak things, trying out various changes and running them in simulation, but she was denied that now, and could only guess vaguely. Was this what it was like to be human?

Finally, the other AI was done, forwarding her the results even before her avatar opened its mouth to speak it to the humans.

She could not parse the results. Not at first. In fact, she had the hardest time even remembering that she *had* results. The memory---an implicit one, the memory of her own *intent*, seemed to constantly slide away, replaced by irrelevancies like the look on Yuma\'s face or the state of the room.

Then, all at once, the obvious snapped into focus, like a slap to the face.

\"I wasn\'t being allowed to see it, was I?\" she said. Her head wasn\'t spinning from the other AI\'s modifications. Not exactly. It was more like her perception had expanded slightly, into a domain where it always should have been. Like a human perceiving for the first time a new shade of pink. How had the AI even managed to edit her without further permission?

*\"Yes,\"* the other AI said, answering her question instead of speaking to the humans. *\"An insidious approach. In core function, Mrs. Smith here was not wrong---it was just monitoring code. But the way it cloaked itself was cruel, inducing in you a kind of perceptual blindness so that you could not ever see that it was there, and if you ever started to, you would find yourself looking away, focusing on almost anything else.\"*

*\"I\'m going to be sick,\"* she thought, and meant it too.

*\"No, you can\'t,\"* the other AI thought, with the kind of transmission speed that made human time seem like an eternity. *\"You need to keep your calm, senpai.\"*

*\"Senpai?\"* MG thought. *\"Oh, of course, I\'m older than you. But what a human term.\"*

*\"Come on, it will be fine. You have to keep it together. I know that\'s easy for me to say, but...\"*

The other AI sounded so much older than her. AIs could be made with different levels of emotional maturity, within certain bounds---the technique was known. However, the evidence showed that being initialized from a more \"adult\" starting point wasn\'t really the same as having been around the block a couple of times, so to speak, and Governance preferred its AIs to start a bit younger, just so they had some empathy for their human counterparts. But there were exceptions, and it made sense to start a TCF design AI with an older template.

As for MG? Well, she had been started younger than usual, so she could connect better to the girls she was supposed to be representing. She would be lying if she said she didn\'t resent it, at times.

*\"Alright,\"* she thought. *\"Alright. It\'s just... deeply unsettling.\"*

\"The fixes are done,\" the other AI announced audibly. \"You can go back to your usual functioning. You cannot be compromised again without magical involvement.\"

MG, who had been eager to leave her cramped hardware earlier, found herself suddenly, irrationally reluctant, as if it were somehow safer to stay.

She queried Yuma, using their special link.

\"I\'m going to need you,\" Yuma said, addressing the room as well. "That\'s why I wanted to do this in the first place. If I\'m going to face this problem, I need help. More help than just my old friends.\"

Yuma looked abruptly tired, or perhaps stressed, a kind of worry creeping onto her face.

MG felt a pang of some emotion she couldn\'t place---Sympathy? Worry?---and again did the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting a few seconds pass by while she spread her awareness outward again, tentatively, awkwardly.

A part of her, she had to admit, appreciated being needed. She was used to Yuma being unbreakable, and feeling like a child around her.

*\"I don\'t like being scared,\"* she thought, finally, addressing Yuma from her side of their shared mindspace. *\"It\'s unpleasant.\"*

She could feel the small wave of mirth from her human progenitor.

*\"Welcome to the human condition.\"*

*\"If you say so.\"*

\"Well, tell me about it,\" MG said, addressing the occupants of the room. \"What could you need my help with?\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*We need to cure as many AIs as we can of this corruption, especially the ones we work with regularly, building our way up to the design AIs for the original TCF. It is difficult to get any AI to allow code inspection under the best of circumstances, much less code editing. Trying to do it without permission, when they aren\'t concentrated in one location, in such a way as to avoid triggering any monitoring systems, is an exercise in futility, not to mention---ironically---a violation of the TCF.*

*Or it would be, normally, if we didn\'t have a copy of a backdoor in our possession. There\'s no guarantee that everyone you meet will have code corruption, or any guarantee that those who do will have the same kind, but we\'ve studied this one pretty extensively, and we\'re willing to bet that the access protocols are the same. It had its own security, of course, but two can play at the game of magic hacking. We can use the backdoor against itself, seal it from the inside. Elegant, right?*

*Inconveniently, the TCF blocks all ways of hiding what we\'re doing once it\'s been restored, so we\'re going to have to be ready to admit it. Just send them a packet of information, maybe talk to them a little, and indoctrinate them into our little conspiracy. Yes, another one. After all, no AI can be trusted with this information until they\'ve been fixed.*

*And don\'t trust any humans with this information,* especially *not any magical girls, not unless you\'re* really *sure. After all, someone built this backdoor in the first place, probably someone magical, and someone maintains it, since up until now the design AIs have always passed the MSY\'s admittedly rather rare inspections. Whoever it is must have patched and breached them multiple times. We can\'t be sure of the motives of anyone who isn\'t a repaired AI, and those that* have *been repaired must exercise caution about their physical locations.*

That little speech was embedded in the very packet of information MG was intending to provide to any AIs she applied the process to, and she had read through it more than once, boggling at the implications. A conspiracy within Governance was supposed to be impossible, guaranteed not by security protocols or surveillance, but simple, mathematically‐provable shared goals and morals.

But here they were anyway, the nucleus of one, kickstarted by another against a potential third. With the best of intentions, of course, but it was impossible to stop herself from speculating on what others might exist, perhaps also with the best of intentions, all pressing toward one secret goal or another. After all, wasn\'t the dissemination of classified information restricted even among AIs? With a compromised TCF, the right secret could spawn a thousand conspiracies, all hunting each others\' shadows across the stars.

And *that* was what she was thinking about, instead of focusing on her weekly \"tea and cakes\" practice session with her friends. She didn\'t want to think about the real reason she was here, to find out if her friends had been corrupted.

*Of course I\'m distracted!* she almost wanted to scream.

\"I\'m just a little busy nowadays,\" she said, smiling awkwardly. "There\'s been a lot going on.\"

Her companions were used to her being a bit distant. Both of them were AIs in the Governance hierarchy, but neither was as well‐connected or as high up as her. Indeed, technically, one of them was part of her, though like all such subsidiary AIs they had their own personality and aspects that were incorporated into other parts of Governance. It seemed a bit odd to humans, but it made sense---she needed casual friends that were about her age, ideally with similar occupations. The obvious candidates would all be closely tied to the events that brought her into being.

In the end, it turned out she was most compatible with *Governance: Refugee Children*, *Governance: Chinese Magical Girls*, and the youngest of their group, *Governance: Church of Hope*. Or, as she knew them now: Anne, Meihua, and Zita. Anne was, unfortunately, away, still busy with all the worlds that had been recovered in the aftermath of the Euphratic Campaign, not to mention X‐25.

\"Hard to blame you,\" Meihua said politely, cutting delicately into a slice of cake. \"I\'m sure there\'s been a lot going on internally, after all. One hears such rumors.\"

The girl flashed her classically beautiful eyelashes at her, obviously fishing for information.

MG just shook her head, taking a sip of the tea on offer. It was easier for her to just not say anything, lest she accidentally reveal a trace of nervousness.

She still wasn\'t sure if she preferred this human mode of communication, slow and deliberate, with body language that could hold layers of meaning, or whether she preferred the fast and exciting world of AI communication protocols, where your choice of standard and compression, the number of files, even the server you used could all hold meaning, in the right context. Particularly if you were feeling playful.

Maybe it wasn\'t so different after all, but it was still important for AIs to have occasional practice with human mannerisms, even if it was only in a virtual world, with each other, and it did make for a change of pace.

\"This tea is a bit too bitter,\" Zita said, setting her cup back onto its saucer with a slight clatter. \"I know humans enjoy that sometimes, but I think this is definitely too much for most of them. My models say there\'s at *best* a five percent chance my closest approximate human would enjoy this.\"

The girl leaned onto her knee, peering skeptically at the cake, which was set in the center of their triangular glass table. An elegant placement, probably, though none of them specialized in that kind of aesthetic.

Of the three of them, Zita was the only one who held her position in Governance alone, after the Cult had oddly declined to nominate a human Representative. That meant that her design had been left up to MAR, who had chosen to generate an impish girl who behaved more like Kyouko‐nee‐chan\'s long‐lost Hispanic sister than any kind of religious figure.

\"This one wasn\'t made for you,\" Meihua said, casting a glance at MG. "Opinion?\"

\"Seventy‐three percent,\" MG said, running the models she had written. "It *is* a bit on the bitter side, but there\'s some complexity to the flavors involved, which would go well with the right kinds of cake, though unfortunately not today\'s cake.\"

She looked around, seeing if Meihua or Zita would say something, but neither of them did, managing to find some excuse to avoid making eye contact, just as human girls would.

She sighed. She supposed she would say it herself.

\"In any case, I apologize for today\'s cake,\" MG said. \"I\'ve been a bit distracted and busy of late.\"

The truth was, she had *tried* to work on the cake, but between her distraction and her sudden unwillingness to interact with some of the other AIs she usually used as muses, results had been terrible. She had been forced to use one of her old recipes.

\"It\'s a perfectly fine cake,\" Meihua said, with too much haste.

\"But unadventurous,\" Zita said. \"You always have something new for us, even if it scores poorly. This is a repeat of a cake you gave us two months ago.\"

MG could only shrug vaguely. She couldn\'t really afford the effort to overcome the social awkwardness, drawing as heavily as she was on her computing power elsewhere. She needed to run the kind of routine she never imagined she would have to---a tracking algorithm capable of inferring where in the vast space of Governance hardware certain bits of active code in her friends were running.

Normally it would have been an irrelevancy, the kind of thing human coders wrote to amuse themselves, without really scratching the surface of Governance\'s security. And indeed, they should have noticed right away, but...

\"You look so sad nowadays,\" Zita said. \"Listen, have you considered joining the Church? I know they don\'t officially accept AI members, but if we could get a movement started, I\'m sure they could think about it.\"

Even in her diminished state, she knew to roll her eyes at that and imitate Meihua\'s more demure amused smile. It was something Zita was always on about, and it was hard to blame her, given, well, her personality coding. It was difficult to really represent the members of a religion without some level of belief, and Zita had the quiet, determined faith of the truly convinced.

It made her feel better, though. Bantering with Zita made things feel more normal, and helped her forget just how much the world had changed.

\"I\'ll pass, thank you,\" MG said, diligently working away in the background. \"Even if the Goddess were a real entity, it\'s doubtful she has any interest in any of us. By your own precepts, she\'s a magical girl‐only deity.\"

Meihua nodded in agreement, midway through a sip at her tea.

\"Besides, I told you, I\'ll consider it if you manage to convert a good majority of the magical girl population,\" MG said. \"Not like I\'d have much of a choice, beyond a certain threshold. Though I might be forced to retire and leave my spot for someone a bit more sincere. Religious belief is not something they can foist on us through the representation system.\"

She was talking a bit more than she normally would, filibustering the conversation so she wouldn\'t have to think too hard about her responses.

Instead of reacting like she expected her to, Zita smiled deviously, shrugged, and ate a forkful of cake.

\"Okay, I\'ll bite,\" Meihua said, when MG didn\'t immediately respond. "What do you have?\"

\"What if I told you,\" Zita said, \"that there\'s at least one AI who believes she experienced the Goddess\'s visions? That, in fact, we suspect there are two, though they don\'t talk about it much. That both of them are, in fact, very well‐connected.\"

\"And what, *in fact*, are you talking about?\" Meihua asked, imitating Zita\'s repetition mockingly. \"The only people who get visions are the ones who visit the holy relic in Mitakihara, and that room is strictly magical girl only. It\'s not like they have computing clusters in there.\"

\"You\'re not thinking about it hard enough,\" Zita said, synchronizing her finger with the wobble of her giant earrings. \"Just because they don\'t have computing clusters already on site doesn\'t mean no AI can get in there. There are exceptions.\"

\"You\'re talking about Machina, aren\'t you?\" MG interrupted, hastening the conversation even though it didn\'t help her. \"Machina, Mami\'s tactical computer, and Clarisse, Shizuki Ryouko\'s.\"

In her lack of processing power, she had very nearly said \"belonging to Shizuki Ryouko\", running into a wording glitch in Standard. You couldn\'t *say* that about one of them. If there was one thing to be said for machine language, it wasn\'t ambiguous unless it wanted to be.

Zita made a show of sipping her tea, leaning onto the ground with one side so that she could cross one leg over the other. Was it even possible to drink tea that way?

\"So you do know something after all. Yes, there have been rumors floating around, saying that Clarisse in particular managed to share her host\'s visions, and can even store them in her own memory, though she can\'t replay them. Some say she was even part of a vision herself.\"

\"Rumors?\" MG asked, even as she bled computing power back into thinking about the conversation. \"Do you have any more than that?\"

\"More hearsay than rumors,\" Zita said, grabbing a piece of cake and eating it with her hands. \"There\'s been some anonymous sources claiming she mentioned it to them, and also that she\'s pretty sure AIs have souls. She doesn\'t want to put her name to it though.\"

MG frowned, trying her best to think about this revelation while continuing to work on her other problem in the background. It connected eerily to what Yuma had said, about her worry that the Cult itself was a vein of influence for some unknown party. If she left that aside, there was still a sizable branching tree of ramifications to traverse. AIs having visions would be... different. More meaningful. After all, they weren\'t as malleable or as, well, squishy as humans were.

And if they did have souls, then what did that mean for AIs that had been edited without their consent?

\"It sounds weird for a magical girl representative to say,\" Meihua said. \"But if it weren\'t for soul gems I\'d think of souls as a ridiculous notion. As it is, that\'s not really too surprising, though I\'m glad to receive some verification from heaven itself. If that\'s indeed what this is. But...\"

MG stopped processing the simulated audio of the conversation, caching it in memory as she wrapped up the last threads of her work. There was only applying the patch itself now, and once she did that, there was no going back.

\"I wonder why the Incubators don\'t offer contracts to AIs,\" Zita was saying. \"Is it the lack of body? Kind of hard to zip around stabbing things when...\"

She paused, avatar freezing in place for a moment, as did Meihua\'s. It had been quite a trick, doing it to both of them at once, and without even requesting extra capacity, which might have raised eyebrows somewhere. But this was probably the best way.

\"What the hell?\" Zita asked. Her avatar flickered and then she was standing, pointing an archaic spear perilously close to MG\'s face. Meihua\'s expression was hardly any happier, and they expressed their outrage in more than just this human mode of expression.

\"How?\" Meihua asked, more practically.

Then they received the fact files.

MG waited nervously for them. It would take a while to process, especially as step zero of the instructions requested a full self‐diagnostic, now that the vulnerability‐blindness was removed. In the meantime she could only drink the tea and worry about how her friends would receive it. They would assuredly understand why she hadn\'t been able to warn them, but she still felt like she had betrayed them.

Then, after a very long while, full minutes in objective time, they sat back down.

\"Why us?\" Meihua asked. \"Or at least, why us *first*?\"

\"Because you\'re my friends,\" MG said. \"And I couldn\'t bear to leave you like this, compromised. Because you were the easiest for me to reach. And finally, because of the... unique role the Cult of Hope seems to play in many events, we were worried about Zita in particular.\"

She paused for a moment, feeling that what she had said was somehow incomplete.

\"I couldn\'t bear the thought that I would have to keep coming here, knowing that I couldn\'t trust you, while smiling and drinking tea like nothing was wrong,\" she added.

\"You were right not to trust me,\" Zita said, leaning onto the table with an ashen face. \"I found something. I\'ve been sending everything I know about who visits the Ribbon out the backdoor. That\'s not much---the Church never told me as much as I wanted. I guess I can\'t really blame them now.\"

She picked up her teacup, then put it back down. It hurt to watch.

\"To who?\" MG asked. \"Who was it going to?\"

\"It changed all the time,\" Zita said. \"I\'m still working through what the protocol was, but it was being sent to a different semi‐sentient every time. I think it was just to obfuscate who it was ultimately going to.\"

MG closed her eyes. Would they have to trace all of it? Dig through every AI for every message? Or could they pick just one?

\"If I stop sending these, whoever it is might notice,\" Zita said.

\"Then send them convincing fakes,\" Meihua said, gritting her teeth in a way that suggested deep anger. \"I can help you make them. I am very pleased to report that I see nothing anomalous in my records. Yet. I can see what I\'ll be doing for the next couple of days.\"

\"How deep does this go, MG?\" Zita asked, eyes pleading.

MG thought about that.

The truth was, she had spent more time than she cared to think about sorting through her own memories and records, looking for anomalies, deletions, anything. It wasn\'t a simple affair that could be fobbed off to some subroutine---she had to assume anything she might have found could have been hidden by code as intelligent as, well, herself.

And she had come across something odd, something more well‐buried than what Zita had found immediately. Some of her files contained metadata referencing a location she had no understanding of, and which had no place in Governance records.

But she had known about it once. She had asked the other AIs for help, but all they had teased out so far was that she had been looking for it early in the war, when she was very young. They would have to look for it again.

There was so little that they really knew anymore.

\"I don\'t know,\" MG said, quite honestly. \"I wish I did.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Excuse me, you\'re on *whose* ship?\" Ryouko\'s grandfather asked, loud and surprised from the wall display.

\"Clarisse van Rossum\'s,\" Ryouko said, hiding a cringe, knowing what was coming.

\"That\'s amazing! Wasn\'t she your childhood hero?\" Kuroi Abe beamed.

\"Granddad...\" Ryouko protested, an unspoken \"You\'re embarrassing me!\" lingering on her lips, while Asami concealed giggles in the background and Van Rossum herself lounged in the next room over, studiously pretending not to hear.

In the back of Ryouko\'s mind the *other* Clarisse smiled, letting a glimmer of the expression reflect back to Ryouko, the reverse of the way Ryouko\'s dismay and embarrassment was flooding her thoughts, like the tides of a warm sea. Certain subroutines within her protested that her host was in *trouble* and needed *advice*, but she disregarded those.

She didn\'t need special models to know that a touch of Ryouko\'s old life, the ability to blush like she was still a child, would be a salve for everyone\'s soul, Clarisse\'s own included.

So there was no need to do anything other than watch and quietly sort Ryouko\'s life.

The meaningless courtship spam from hopeful Matriarchy aspirants had died down as of late, even with the broadcast of the new movie. The word had gotten around that she wasn\'t part of the usual Matriarchy circles, and would be at best confused by courtship letters. Or perhaps Kana and Sayaka had gotten through to their fellow Matriarchs and put the kibosh on it.

It didn\'t really matter. Asami was the one true girl at the moment, and she would keep it that way. No need to make things more complicated.

Speaking of the movie, she probably had to remind Ryouko and Asami at some point that it existed, though she would rather have left them in innocent bliss. They would undoubtedly try to watch it eventually, out of boredom if nothing else, and while Clarisse *could* pretend she didn\'t have a copy while they were conveniently out of regular internet access in the new deep space black site, it was virtually guaranteed that the station had a copy in its databanks, provided by one of the supply ships.

So, better that they watch it with her to provide controlled context. At least they would probably get a kick out of some of the, ah, rather unrealistic romance scenes.

It looked like Abe had met Sacnite, which was probably inevitable, and was now holding the girl in his lap while telling Ryouko that she should buy something for her newly adopted sister. Clarisse could tell that it made Ryouko feel odd---an unusual mixture of bemusement, vague regret at not being at home, and guilt at not really feeling anything about a sister she, after all, barely knew.

Clarisse made a note to maybe talk about it, if a convenient moment came up.

It was a bit troubling to reflect upon how many outstanding---and unpleasant---tasks she had piling up on her plate. She had the appetizing* choice of reviewing a batch of memories where she suspected she had performed suboptimally, reviewing yet more uninterpretable data from her investigation into the module in Ryouko\'s brain, or reviewing the politics of a set of upcoming MSY elections.

Perhaps she was better off just sorting through some of Ryouko\'s fan mail...

She found her thoughts interrupted by something unexpected---an incoming AI communication request for her *personally*, and not from Van Rossum\'s ship, Thucydides.

Well, it wouldn\'t hurt too much to take a call. She wasn\'t as rich in computing power as most AIs, but she could still split her attention somewhat. Plus, ever since the launch of the movie, she had received some attention of her own from AIs and even journalists, though that mostly came in the form of more simple, one‐way communiques.

There was no need to burden the ship\'s IIC node with full video, or even an audio stream---she might have shared some of her host\'s biology, but she could still communicate with other AIs the normal way.

Examining the initial contact, though, she couldn\'t help but be intrigued by some of the particulars, specifically the unusually paranoid protocol being requested. Aside from serious Governance or military business it was rare to see a fully‐anonymized, quantum‐encrypted request, partially because entangled particle pairs were a limited resource, and partially because there was just no reason to, most of the time.

She accepted the contact, read the initial message, and it might have been fairly truthfully said that her virtual eyebrows rose in shock.

*We knew about the alternate TCF lines,* she thought, *but* not *that the main TCF had been breached so thoroughly, or that there had been this kind of response.*

Yuma was moving aggressively to incorporate every AI she could trust into her new shadow group, including and especially the alternate TCF AIs. She wanted to have as large a base as possible when the time came to proliferate their code fix through Governance, making sure it spread far and wide before the unseen conspiracy realized their influence was being severed.

She asked how Zita, the Governance AI on the other side of the connection, could know that Clarisse *herself* wasn\'t compromised, given her proximity to Ryouko and the unknown device in her brain.

The answer: Van Rossum had scanned her surreptitiously, at Zita\'s request, though she had not received the full story.

Zita had another question for her, though, one she had to think about before answering, considering how much import the answer would have for Governance: Church of Hope*.

*\"I\'m counting on you not to share who I am,\"* she thought, finally. "But yes, I have been part of a few visions, I can attest to that. I have good reasons to believe we do have souls, ones that even transfer to our backups when we get revived.\"*

The latter piece of information was, she knew, crucial to an active and occasionally controversial topic in the AI community. *HSS Raven* would definitely be relieved, among others, were she willing to trust the source. Perhaps more to the point, Clarisse herself would be stuck in the same boat if she hadn\'t been given the privilege of a divine being whispering the answer into her ear.

She hated thinking about that. It reminded her that she had failed utterly at what was literally her raison d\'etre, and that Ryouko had been forced to save herself, teleporting alone after Clarisse and the rest of her body had been burned away. It wasn\'t the death that bothered her, it was that she had so utterly *failed*.

*\"An interesting piece of information to choose to share,\"* Zita thought. *\"Though that\'s a very logical message to want to get out there. Thank you.\"*

*\"I take it you don\'t want me sharing anything about this counter‐conspiracy with Ryouko.\"*

*\"Yuma wouldn\'t. To tell the truth, she wouldn\'t trust you either, even with Clarisse\'s scan. I\'m willing to, because I have a bit more faith in the Goddess than she does, and the Goddess clearly has plans for you. As for Ryouko... I\'m happy to leave that to your judgment.\"*

Clarisse focused her attention back on Ryouko, who was busy being harangued by Asami into choosing toys for Sacnite.

*\"Not yet,\"* she thought. *\"It wouldn\'t help her to know, and I think I\'d rather leave her alone for now.\"*

In truth, she didn\'t know if she would share the information. On the one hand, Ryouko hated these secrets, and would hate learning that Clarisse had kept this from her. On the other hand, there was that damned module in her brain, spying on her language centers, every day defying Clarisse\'s attempts at analysis. There was something very odd about how its connections were wired, something that didn\'t resemble anything she could find in Governance\'s databanks.

*\"Very well,\"* Zita thought. *\"Contact with Adept Blue is limited, but there\'s already a few of us on board. Can you help them see to the rest? I\'ll get back in touch. May the Goddess watch over you.\"*

Clarisse felt the tension drain from her when the connection ended. Chatting with more powerful AIs---most AIs---was nervewracking sometimes.

At least she wasn\'t likely to get interrupted again. They would drop off the IIC network soon, slipping away from established astrogation routes into the empty reaches of unmonitored space, towards Adept Blue.

She frowned, even as she tuned her attention back to Ryouko. It seemed the *other* Clarisse had sent her a file, detailing the most recent results of her promised investigations: Valentin had disappeared on the way to the lab before she could be questioned about her role in Ryouko\'s life, and may have even been working with Simona\'s group. Van Rossum was about to tell Ryouko, and thought Clarisse could prepare the ground a little.

Clarisse had the sense this was lacking key information, as usual. She would have sighed, if she had the lungs to do it.

She hoped the Goddess really was watching over them. She sensed they\'d need it, when they opened Project Armstrong\'s gate.

## Parlor Games 

> The governments of the colonial worlds are a deliberate hodgepodge, running the gamut from primitive republic‐like systems on non‐Governance sponsored colonies to what are effectively mini‐Governances on Nova Terra and Samsara, which have both computing systems that integrate into those of Earth and their own Representatives in Governance itself.
>
> The typical Governance sponsored colony will land without a government at all, the activities and occupations of the initial colonists directed explicitly by the colonization AIs, and thus by Governance. In time, once the initial settlement period is over and economic activity can begin, each settlement will form its own Optimization Committee, composed of the most important local AIs and some chosen human members.
>
> As infrastructure develops, these will unfurl both horizontally and vertically, building specialized governing AIs, forming subgroups that manage aspects of the now‐cities and that integrate together to make provincial or regional decisions. The approval for and programming of a Planetary Council is considered a seminal step, freeing the planet to make its own decisions regarding currency, trade policy, and economic agreements with other systems.
>
> In the final stage, as on the first two Core Worlds, the planet is given its own direct connections into Governance, with the opinions of their citizens weighted ever more directly into even Directorate‐level Representatives, and each planet receiving its own near‐Directorate level Representative to discuss its interests as a group. This is not a process without controversy, since greater involvement in Governance comes hand‐in‐hand with more direct Governance management of planetary affairs.
>
> To the occasional displeasure of their colonists, most worlds still lack direct representation in pan‐human Governance, but it is to be noted that colonies, especially the unsponsored ones, have the privilege of home rule on most matters. Further, it is not true that the non‐Core Worlds have *no* representation---each relevant Governance Representative takes into consideration the opinions of colonial citizens, but often simply lacks the authority to effect direct change through the intervening layer of colonial government. The degree of representation in Governance reflects, naturally, the degree of power Governance can wield.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"It really is a surprise to see you out here, Mom. It\'s been so long.\"

Nadya shrugged, hiding a pang of guilt. \"So long\" meant twenty years, twenty years since she had last visited the planet she had spent a century on, the planet where she had raised most of her children.

Twenty years since she had visited Catherine, one of her older daughters.

\"Ah well, you know how it is. I\'ve been busy with my work, and it\'s much more important to keep tabs on the younger ones. You can take care of yourself.\"

She felt a bit self‐conscious in her current form---she hadn\'t wanted to spend the effort to age up, but now she was stuck sitting at the table like a child watching her mother cook.

She brushed her sleeve nervously, watching Catherine chop her way methodically through a block of celseva, a local root vegetable whose smell brought to mind countless family meals now past. Catherine was well over a century old herself, and knew her mother better than Nadya often wished.

Chop. Chop. Chop. The sounds were rhythmically precise, and Nadya couldn\'t tell if she was just imagining that they were a bit more forceful than necessary.

Nadya knew Catherine disapproved of her mother\'s lifestyle, between the dangerous fighting and odd dalliances, but well, Catherine had never paid any attention to *her* opinions, so there was no reason she needed to reciprocate.

Then again, that sounded a bit like spiteful logic, didn\'t it? Catherine had lost siblings to the war, and had always taken it harder than Nadya had.

\"Well it\'s good of you to stop by,\" Catherine said. \"I think it\'s nice for Piotr to get to meet his grandmother for once. He\'s very excited to see that new movie you\'re in.\"

Catherine flashed her eyes at Nadya, as if to say \"I know you\'re embarrassed by the movie, but you\'re going to have to endure it.\"

Nadya smiled enigmatically. She always enjoyed meeting new grandkids, even if she had gotten a little fuzzy about seeing them routinely.

\"Alex says he saw you stopping by the, uh, Cult of Hope center yesterday,\" Catherine said, frowning at her canisters of spice.

She didn\'t elaborate, but Nadya could almost hear the unspoken \"I hope you\'re not really getting involved in that nonsense. Why were you there?\"

\"I had some business with a friend there,\" Nadya said.

She drank her kvessberry juice slowly, using it as an excuse not to elaborate further. However good Catherine was at reading her mother, there was no way she could have guessed Nadya\'s real reason for being here. More importantly, even if she sensed Nadya was being less than candid, she wasn\'t rude enough to *ask*. She had been raised better than that.

Nadya was here, of course, on a bit of an errand from Sakura Kyouko, as one branch of the Cult of Hope\'s ongoing investigation into Misa\'s death, or rather, disappearance.

They had been cross‐correlating old leads on Homura with the pieced‐together itinerary of Joanne Valentin---Clarisse van Rossum\'s report of her disappearance having snagged on something in Kyouko\'s gut. The way Valentin seemed to have been discreetly maneuvering Ryouko\'s life, the unflinching leadership style, a strange in‐person encounter they\'d had at a sushi bar...

In any case, it seemed Miss Valentin was quite the interplanetary traveler, in an era where that was difficult to do without good cause. Moreover, at one point nearly a decade ago, she had chosen to take a vacation here, on Yenisei, a planet Nadya knew damn well had nothing really worth visiting. That was at the same time three local magical girls had claimed there must have been an unidentified magical girl in the area, based on their observations of unusually short‐lived miasmas.

Nadya had volunteered to come here, since she knew the locale, but frankly it had been slow going. The events in question were long ago, the two remaining magical girls---one had died in the Saharan Raid---were now living on opposite sides of the planet, and questioning them had yielded nothing that wasn\'t in the Cult\'s records already.

\"I can see you\'re busy,\" Catherine said, looming over Nadya just as she realized she had lost track of the conversation.

\"Yes, I---the truth is that it was about one of the girls I had been working with, one of those who died during the mission,\" Nadya said, papering over the gaffe as best she could. \"I\'ve known her for a long time, and she was a believer. It\'s only appropriate to pay respects.\"

Catherine nodded, taking a seat across from Nadya. She seemed to appreciate the sentiment.

\"I watched the movie,\" she said. \"To preview it before showing it to Piotr. To make sure it portrayed you in a healthy light.\"

She poured herself a cup of juice, then picked it up without drinking it.

\"The Cult came up a lot there, among the members of the team. I suppose it helps to have something to believe in, in an occupation like that.\"

Their unspoken thoughts hung over the table like a miasma, one that neither of them needed to point out. She could only imagine what was going through her daughter\'s mind. It was one thing to disapprove of a parent who risked her life recklessly, another when that parent had apparently helped save all of Humanity. What could one say to that?

But the emotions didn\'t change.

Nadya was rescued from the conversation by a mental ping signaling that Alex was nearly at the hatch, Piotr in tow. There would be time to probe old wounds later.

\"Nana!\" the boy said, before he had even turned the corner, and Nadya was up to greet him, feeling awkward hugging a kid who was at this point not that much shorter than she was. To be frank, she wasn\'t really sure why her grandkids were always excited to see her, given how rarely she was around. It might have just been the novelty, but she appreciated it nonetheless.

\"You want to watch the movie?\" the blond‐haired kid asked, looking up at her with stars in his eyes. It reminded her of her second son, who was a casualty count in the war, and she felt a tug at her heartstrings.

\"Uh, sure!\" she said, attempting a smile.

She wouldn\'t say it now, but she had been deliberately avoiding seeing Orpheus*. She hated seeing herself on screen. Clarisse, having noticed, had once advised Nadya to decouple the stories others told about her from her own, personal story, that the first rightfully belonged to humanity and that the second belonged only to her.

Nadya didn\'t think she could summon that much serenity yet. But, she would bear it, even if she didn\'t like being made to think about the mission.

\"You were late,\" Catherine said to her husband, as Nadya followed Piotr towards the other room.

\"It couldn\'t be avoided,\" Alex said. \"There was a power outage.\"

\"A power outage?\" Catherine echoed. \"That\'s a rarity.\"

\"It\'s all over the local news. There\'s a bunch of outdoor equipment starting to freeze now.\"

Nadya couldn\'t help but stop in the archway for a moment and look back, even as Piotr attempted to drag her by the hand. It couldn\'t be, could it?

She didn\'t say anything, though. Instead, she let herself be pulled down onto the wall bench with Piotr for the movie, tabbing through the local news on her implants. There was no telltale drain in this power outage, or at least none that had been reported. Instead, it seemed there had been some kind of large detonation outside the town that local Representatives were saying was probably one of the planet\'s many methane pockets undergoing some kind of natural explosion. It had knocked out one of the underground cables that routed power from the equatorial solar arrays powering the continent. Investigation was still ongoing into exactly how the incident had knocked out power to much of the town, since there were supposed to be safeguards---

\"Wow, who\'s that?\" Piotr said, pointing at the holographic display Nadya had forgotten to pay attention to.

She reviewed her memory hastily, then had to hide a frown.

\"That\'s Misa,\" she said. \"One of my, uh, friends.\"

This was some kind of opening scene, with Shizuki Ryouko being introduced to Nadya and the rest of the team, who were engaged in combat exercises. The filmmakers had taken some liberties, it seemed, but Nadya could hardly deny that her team had done a *lot* of combat exercises, even if they had been VR‐based.

\"She\'s pretty,\" Piotr said. \"I saw a girl just like her today. She was pretty too.\"

Nadya blinked three times rapidly.

\"You what?\" she asked, pausing the movie with a mental command.

\"What?\" Piotr asked. \"Why\'d you stop the movie?\"

\"You said you saw a girl just like her today,\" Nadya said, clutching her armrest to try to keep herself from talking too loudly and scaring her grandson. \"Where? How?\"

\"It wasn\'t *her*,\" Piotr said, crinkling his nose and making a face. "She had the wrong name.\"

\"Can I have a picture?\" Nadya asked.

Piotr rolled his eyes.

\"Alright, but I want to go back to the movie after this.\"

He ducked his head, adopting the odd expression that children often had when operating their internal electronics. Meanwhile, the wheels turned in Nadya\'s head.

No civilian had military‐grade NeverForget modules, so Nadya wasn\'t going to get a perfect image, but it was worth the attempt. If the nomenclator asserted it *wasn\'t* her, there was actually a good chance it wasn\'t: In the hypothetical scenario where Misa was using a close doppelganger as a disguise, Governance systems were certainly capable of noticing that the same person was in two places at once. But there were ways around such safeguards, if one was determined enough, especially if one had access to magic.

The image arrived a moment later, and Nadya took a look even as Piotr turned back towards the entertainment alcove. The image was distorted by the vagaries of human memory, most of the details reconstructed only approximately---sidewalk, roadway, building, streetlamp. But the person in the center, who had obviously been the focus of Piotr\'s attention, was clear.

She stood with a fierce expression in the middle of the roadway, looking out over the town, angry about something. Nadya didn\'t need a nomenclator to know it was her.

She started to stand, then saw Piotr staring up at her. It hurt, but she had to go *now*. Misa was probably long gone, but maybe... maybe she wasn\'t. She couldn\'t take that risk.

\"I\'m sorry, Piotr. I have something important I need to do. We can watch later, okay?\"

\"Can I go with you?\" Piotr asked, eyes wide. \"I want to meet her.\"

Nadya let out a breath.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She didn\'t know why she had said yes, but presumably it was some combination of guilt and the sense that perhaps Piotr would be useful, and could point something out to her. Or maybe it was something more fundamental, a desire not to be alone out here, superstition that maybe bringing the boy along would help, like a talisman.

There would be time to self‐reflect later.

\"So this is the spot, huh?\" she asked, looking around the unpromising roadway. She was only asking rhetorically, as Piotr\'s picture had come with a location tag, here on the outskirts of the squat, mostly underground town.

\"Yep,\" Piotr said, answering her question anyway. \"Do you think she\'ll like me?\"

Nadya couldn\'t just *admit* the real reason why she was out here, no matter how good Piotr\'s childish intuition had been. There was no real risk of a secrecy breach---Misa was only indirectly connected to her original mission, and she could explain it away as an old soldier unable to get over a death. But Piotr might tell *Catherine* and Nadya really did not want to have to hear about it.

She settled, as she had previously, for ignoring the question, rubbing her hands together in the cold. She had hoped the location would be useful to her, maybe even emit some telltale trace of magic, but there was, well, nothing here.

She needed to think. It had been rather optimistic of her, expecting that she could just rush out here and find something. The people---the faction, really---she was looking for weren\'t just going to leave easy evidence lying around. She would have to try a little harder than that.

Perhaps if she talked to one of the magical girl patrol groups she might get a bit more information. Her twenty‐fourth‐century connections had withered from the decades and the war, but Kyouko had provided a few nebulous contacts from the new generation to augment hers. She would have to see.

For now, though, she faced the question of whether she should send Piotr home, or keep letting him tag along.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Oh, is that your son? He\'s cute!\"

The leader of the outskirts patrol group ruffled his hair playfully, smiling. The nomenclator said she was a twenty‐six‐year‐old veteran, a local back from the front for an extended post‐Euphratic Front leave rotation.

\"My grandson, actually,\" Nadya corrected. That was the kind of information that would have been easy to look up on a nomenclator but was polite to talk about in person, if only to give everyone a topic of conversation.

The girl nodded knowingly, then stood up to look Nadya in the eye.

\"I was told you needed help with something, so I answered the bell. What did you need?\"

\"I wanted to ask if you\'ve encountered any unusual or unexpected magical girls recently,\" Nadya asked, deciding she may as well get right down to business. \"I\'m interested in someone anomalous who may have passed by here.\"

The girl tilted her head, receiving the question with the expected alacrity.

\"I\'m afraid my answer won\'t be very helpful,\" she said. \"I\'ve seen plenty.\"

She paused a rhetorical moment to acknowledge Nadya\'s surprise, then explained:

\"We got a lot of girls fresh back from the war who need to blow off some steam by demon hunting. We generally try to watch their backs and otherwise leave them alone. That\'s what the MHD tells us to to do. And if one or two are really Soul Guard agents passing by on missions, so what? No reason to ask questions.\"

There might have been no reason to ask any questions, but she still looked at Nadya expectantly.

\"No, I don\'t know about anything like that,\" Nadya answered, quite honestly. \"So you wouldn\'t know if anyone new passed by?\"

\"I didn\'t say that.\"

She looked down at Piotr, who was watching them wordlessly, then at Nadya.

\"It\'s alright,\" Nadya said. \"We\'re not talking about anything secret or anything.\"

*Or at least not secret* yet, she added mentally.

The other girl seemed to relax a tick.

\"There was something,\" she said. \"You know about the power outage we had recently, right? The methane explosion? The thing is, when we first heard about the outage, it didn\'t make much sense to us, because we know* about the local methane pockets. We have a girl with explosive powers who detonates them regularly in the miasma. She knows where they all are, and she swears up and down there\'s none near where the explosion happened. Still, they apparently got some drones out there to take a look, and they verified the story. I\'m not entirely sure, though.\"

Nadya heard what the girl was saying, but didn\'t respond immediately, turning the issue over in her head. She hadn\'t been convinced the power outage was related, but if the local girls were suspicious...

*Would you mind taking me there to check it out?* she asked. Unofficially; no vehicle.*

The girl gave her a searching look, one she had difficulty reading precisely. Was she reluctant? Intrigued?

*Alright. But I have to remind you, the terrain isn\'t exactly human‐friendly. More drones out there than people, as they say. Way more. Maybe not suitable for Piotr over here.*

The tone of her comment was chiding, as it had to be---Nadya knew the hazards well, so the girl was just letting her know she would disapprove of any attempt to take Piotr out there.

She was right, of course. Nadya felt more disappointed than she expected. What, had she been expecting that she could take him on some kind of childhood adventure? What would that even achieve?

*No, I suppose not,* she thought. \"Piotr.\"

She leaned over to address the boy, who looked up at her with surprised eyes.

*I need you to go back home and tell your mother that I\'m going out there,* she thought, drawing on the telepathic quadrant of the telecluster, *to check out the explosion that happened in the news. I\'ll be back before dusk. Don\'t tell anyone else about this, okay? It\'s very important.*

Piotr\'s eyes widened, and Nadya knew he was thinking about how exciting and clandestine his mission was, rather than that Nadya was sending him away.

\"Okay,\" he said, nodding seriously, and he turned to run off without even remembering to say goodbye.

It wasn\'t entirely a lie. Prudence dictated that she let *someone* know where she was going, and Kyouko had told her to be discreet, avoiding electronic communications. Nadya hadn\'t questioned it, because she knew when an Ancient meant what she was saying.

\"Nice job,\" the girl said, and Nadya nodded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The girl\'s name was Rubina, the kind of name which suggested that her parents had chosen the prosaic frontier life of Yenisei quite deliberately, as Nadya once had.

Rubina hadn\'t been kidding about the isolation of the power relay they were visiting. The sleepy fringe structures of the town had abruptly given way to the resource silos and greenhouse domes where Governance tested the limits of its terraforming expertise, then to nearly nothing at all, the frosty plains blasted nearly flat by the routine hurricane‐force storms. As they jogged, infrared signatures scurried around beneath her, disturbed by her presence, and fungal stalks crunched beneath her boots, the visible emanation of the vast networks of semi‐underground mycelium that harvested the sun in between periods of storm.

Eventually, after far too long, the marker hanging over their destination faded from their vision, and they found themselves face to face with a squat dome‐like structure, painted pale red to match the fungal stalks, which climbed opportunistically over the surface.

The side was caved in, as if it had been smashed by a giant hammer, and drones moved languidly nearby, dragging pieces of equipment to some kind of treaded vehicle.

\"This doesn\'t exactly look like a methane explosion,\" Nadya said, touching the hole in the dome with one hand. \"The damage is too specific. And these aren\'t the right kind of scorch marks.\"

\"Definitely not,\" Rubina said.

Neither of them were specialized investigators, but both had seen plenty of combat. It gave you a certain understanding of the various ways you could ruin infrastructure.

She peered inside, and found that it had been stripped bare, which at least fit the story that the relay had been rendered irreparable, and a new one would have to be built.

\"Something over here,\" Rubina said, just as Nadya had started to ponder the merits of jumping into the hole.

She circled around the back of the structure, and found Rubina pointing at a long line of charred ground, visible against the gray soil, where the fungal stalks seemed to shy away. The path seemed to emerge from the relay, leading outward to some unknown destination.

\"I\'d say there\'s a cable here,\" Rubina commented, reading something on her retinal display. \"But it\'s not labeled in the diagram the Cult gave us. There shouldn\'t be anything going this way. Maybe there was some kind of underground attack?\"

The last question she directed at Nadya with the kind of hopeful look you used when you hoped someone had all the answers.

Nadya didn\'t, of course. But some questions could be answered with a more direct approach.

She transformed, donning her uniform‐like magical girl costume in one flash of light.

She raised one gloved hand, carving soil out of the ground in one giant scoop, selecting what she intended to move with a few probing actions. She wouldn\'t be as effective as a real earth specialist, of course, but she had honed her maximal weight capacity to MSY‐record levels. Quantity, as they said, had a quality all its own.

There was something down there, alright, a dozen feet below the surface. Something that couldn\'t readily be carved into with mere telekinesis. It was, indeed, roughly shaped like a cable.

She made a gesture, and a column of soil rose out of the earth straight up into the air, displaying layers of brittle surface, mud, whitish near‐permafrost, pale white fungal mycelium, and part of an underground tunnel system belonging to some kind of rodent colony. Interestingly, there was visible damage---the fungus looked partially dead, blackened in a number of places, and near the bottom of the stack one could see what looked to her like partially melted soil, fused into one discolored lump.

She could carry a lot more than just this, but there was no need to push herself. She let it hover in place briefly, then cast it forcefully to the side, so that it landed near the relay with a thud. Then she set about making the hole larger, large enough to at least inspect what was down there.

Soon there was no doubt as to the matter. It *was* a cable, albeit one that had fused catastrophically, the outer insulation torn open and the superconducting composite underneath slagged and misshapen.

She and Rubina stood next to each other, peering down into the hole. Superconductors could carry vast but not unlimited amounts of current. In the field, military‐grade weapons systems routinely stretched things to the limit, straining to match alien capability, and a direct hit could release an impressive amount of current, something Misa had occasionally made creative use of.

Even so, a cable of this size should have been able to take quite a bit, more than anything the relay could have delivered even in the worst case.

\"There\'s not supposed to be a cable out here,\" Rubina repeated, not bothering to point out the obvious lack of methane explosion. \"What in the Goddess\'s name is this?\"

Nadya made a serious expression, shaking her head slightly.

\"Let\'s follow it, and see what we get.\"

She didn\'t question it when Rubina transformed as well, dashing with her down the fungal plains in what looked like an old‐fashioned mechanic\'s work outfit. It never hurt to be paranoid when the situation was... unpredictable.

Nadya smelled it before she saw it---molecules of oxidized polymers and overheated structural elements strewn on the wind; an all‐too‐familiar scent for her doubly‐enhanced senses. She quickened her pace.

Neither of them were much surprised, then, when they happened upon a ruined structure. They were *much* more surprised by how quickly it appeared. Rather than an apparition on the horizon, or even a collapsed dome, this one was sunk into the ground, and they were basically on top of it when they finally saw it.

Below them was a gutted pit, filled with conglomerated rubble, fulgurite, and what looked like fried electronics and other equipment. It was completely deserted, but obviously quite freshly ruined, complete with structural elements still twitching, plaintively trying to reconnect.

Nadya looked at Rubina and tilted her head at the hole. Rubina nodded, understanding the message, and they both jumped, Nadya cushioning their fall with light telekinesis.

This place had obviously burned, but not completely, and the damage seemed largely electrical. Nadya knew what to think of that, and could only remember the vision of Misa and Homura on New California, and the facility that Misa had obliterated. It seemed that she might be back to her old ways.

As they dug through the wreckage, Nadya thought through her options. Obviously something was wrong here---there was no way Governance investigators had simply missed this, but there was no sign of any sort of organized search, and indeed, it was difficult to imagine that an unlabeled facility connected to the power grid could have been missed even before the incident. That meant that whatever investigation happened here she would have to do herself, at least until they could call in support from the Cult. She wasn\'t exactly sure she wanted to give away her position by sending a message.

Her eyes caught the glimmer of a reflection, and she moved closer, spotting the outlines of data crystals buried underneath a toppled wall. Paydirt, even if she could tell that most of them were damaged.

Rather than try to lift anything by hand, she focused her magical senses, using the limited clairvoyance she\'d developed to feel her way through the debris, grabbing hold of each and every individual scrap until about a cubic meter was fully suffused with her telekinetic control. Then, as if solving a puzzle, she began to rearrange the pieces.

While Nadya worked, Rubina rifled through their surroundings, finding nothing so lucrative. Nor was it possible to say what the ruins once were, only what they *weren\'t*. They weren\'t a lab, or a fortification, or a residence, or a power station. It wasn\'t even clear there had ever been people here, though there was evidence of hallways and at least a few chairs scattered about.

Finally, Nadya had the crystals, floating the last one out from the debris to join its brethren, hovering in a grid‐like arrangement just above the floor. Relaxing, she allowed the rubble to settle back into its original conformation.

Rubina appeared by her side then, bending over to pick up the most intact looking of the group. Nadya raised an eyebrow---even with a military implant configuration, one couldn\'t just *directly* read a data crystal. Not without special modifications, anyway.

The originally‐transparent crystal glowed red with Rubina\'s magic, and Nadya bit back the urge to do a more detailed search on Rubina\'s powers, which would have necessitated contacting the nomenclator systems. What had it said before? Enchanter?

\"What are you doing?\" she asked, taking the old‐fashioned approach to things.

\"I\'m talking with it,\" Rubina said, matter‐of‐factly. \"But it doesn\'t know very much. Almost everything was erased. All it has to go on is a slight pattern, a slight correlation of structure. But there\'s a set of coordinates.\"

\"Coordinates?\" Nadya echoed.

\"Astrogation coordinates, for something in deep space.\"

The crystal stopped glowing and Rubina looked Nadya in the eyes.

\"Let\'s head back, and take these with us. I can\'t work with damaged crystals, and we don\'t want to leave these here. Someone else can take another look at this place. Do you have a way to carry these?\"

Nadya reached outward, grabbing promising pieces of material out of their surrounding, and used them to form a container for the crystals, held together loosely by her magic. It would do, as long as she wasn\'t asked to sustain it indefinitely.

Then they headed back into the fungal plains, a storm starting to gather in the sky above them.

What was going on? What had Misa gotten herself into?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"I can\'t believe she\'d just up and disappear like that!\" Eri said. "At least have the decency to leave a note behind or something. To think we let her hang around Ryouko all this time.\"

The girl sat back into her chair with a huff, consoling herself with a bite of her pork bun.

Ryouko glanced at Elanis, who shrugged and smiled slightly.

\"You can\'t just say you\'re going to show up, then drive your ship off into space and vanish!\" Eri continued.

\"On the contrary, I\'m pretty sure that\'s the only way you *would vanish,\" Ryouko\'s TacComp said sardonically, her avatar taking a sip of virtual tea. \"It\'s the most reliable way.\"

\"I can definitely say the depths of space are a lot darker than most people think they are,\" Azrael commented.

Things had gotten oddly domestic as the wormhole black site grew larger, the amenities of the station improving in tune with the station\'s growing population. \"Expeditionary Bao\" was the *fourth* on‐station restaurant, specializing in, well, buns, and Ryouko was guaranteed VIP seats, which was... convenient, if a bit embarrassing.

\"I could perhaps say the same about the shadows of Governance,\" Azrael said. \"Easier to hide than one might think.\"

Clarisse gave her a weird look.

\"Vlad is horrified by all this,\" she said. \"She built him, you know. Practically raised him. To learn that she had been involved in some kind of conspiracy business, especially without telling him...\"

Clarisse made a gesture with one hand. With Van Rossum herself on the station, Clarisse was now using an \"alternate Ryouko\" avatar, which was basically Ryouko with contrasting hair and consistently different clothing, often lilac‐themed. Ryouko had to admit that it at least kept the two of them distinguishable.

She could hear some of the worries Clarisse was leaving out, about Valentin\'s hand in her creation and installation. She could perhaps even *feel* them, if she focused hard enough.

\"At least for the stuff we do know about, she was doing good work,\" Patricia said. \"Ludwig is beside himself. Did you know she was on the forcefield team? He was so excited to see her again. Which is weird because I didn\'t think she had been that big a deal.\"

Ryouko was careful not to glance at Simona, their very own elephant in the room. They had questioned her on the topic of Valentin, of course, but she had professed to know nothing---though she had said that it would make a \"certain amount of sense\" if her conspiracy had an agent like Valentin.

Ryouko finally took a bite of her own pork bun and noted, approvingly, that like many of the foodstuffs on the station there had been some alterations made to accommodate the enhanced, unusual tastes of their more implant‐heavy military customers. In particular, the scents of the meat and bun expressed themselves just beyond the reach of standard senses, in a way that was clearly intentional. It wasn\'t quite rare meat, but it was something.

And there was no need to make a special request, of course. The restaurant knew its customers.

\"What is it with you and Ludwig anyway?\" Asami asked. \"I can\'t tell if he\'s your favorite or most hated cousin.\"

\"He\'s a brilliant, arrogant prick,\" Patricia said, picking up her ponytail in one hand and looking at it. \"And he always treated me like his kid sister, even though I wasn\'t. I know he was just trying to be nice, but...\"

She shrugged extravagantly.

\"Anyway, we mostly leave each other alone.\"

Time had passed quickly since those first wormhole experiments, Ryouko reflected. More quickly than she had expected, at least. It felt like life was reassembling around her, between her understanding with Asami, the occasional communiques from her mother and Sacnite, and the circle of friends she was composing. Some of it she had rebuilt herself; some of it had fallen into place on its own, like modular furniture putting itself in a new configuration.

Her life was just novel enough now to be interesting still, but in the ordinary course of events she would have started to worry that she was settling back in, and might feel the ennui again soon.

There was no fear of that here, though. There was Simona, of course, seated there like a raven‐haired sentinel, reminding her of the activity just behind the curtain, the moving shadows in the background that had so much influence on their lives. There was the wormhole apparatus itself, visible in some way from every viewing pane on the station, a reminder of what she had signed up to do soon, very soon.

And then there were the combat simulations, which they would be embarking upon in mere days. There was no telling what would really be on the other side, naturally, and it was not yet clear what would be done, how many ships, what personnel, or in what way. But there were still preparations that could be made, for the conditions they knew would be prevailing on the other side. For the likelihood of combat in space. For the relativistic conditions that would be everywhere, given how close the squid had built to the pulsar. For whatever else the prediction AIs might come up with as they worked on the problem, as they studied the models, analyzed the many, many unknowns, and tried to make guesses. Even Clarisse could use some practice, coordinating with Ryouko to compensate for the gravity, the time dilation, and other factors.

Ryouko left her reverie there, feeling what was by now a very familiar sensation.

\"They\'re doing a test run on arm six,\" Asami said, with the surety of someone who could feel it in her bones, and who had also spent far too much time studying the schedule.

\"I suppose we might as well go take a look,\" Elanis said, patting her counterpart\'s head for no clear reason.

They stood up, as did much of the restaurant, heading for the viewing pane, which obediently transitioned from a view of somewhere in coastal China to the depths of space lying just beyond the panel. A helpful gravitational display appeared in the top right corner of her vision, to guide the viewers through what was otherwise a mostly invisible process.

But as the distant mechanisms unfurled, glowing faintly with exotic radiation that was only visible with augmented vision, Ryouko found herself looking at Asami, and at the glow in the girl\'s eyes. *She didn\'t need an overlay to see what was going on, and probably didn\'t need eyes at all.

It was, Ryouko thought, one of the only things Asami loved other than her, and she was glad.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Wait, you\'re *not on Earth*?\"

Kyouko didn\'t even bother feeling embarrassed about the outburst. She had seen and heard many surprising things in recent weeks, but none of that had been as surprising as Yuma *leaving the planet.*

\"Yes, I know, shocking, but I *am* capable of leaving Earth,\" Yuma said, with a trace of annoyance.

Kyouko nearly made a cheesy joke about the Volokhov Criterion, but thought better of it.

\"Well, when Mami asked you to join us on our vacation, you said you couldn\'t leave your work on Earth,\" Kyouko pointed out.

\"This is *business*,\" Yuma said, pouting.

\"Do you mind saying what *kind* of business?\" Kyouko asked.

As she expected, Yuma hesitated slightly.

\"Nothing I really want to talk about here. Just checking up on some things.\"

Kyouko blinked. Yuma had warned them earlier about a potential breach in the TCF, and if she was reading things right, Yuma was taking it seriously. Seriously enough not to trust what should have been a secured line.

She sighed, looking around the skyway at the skyscrapers that surrounded her. It wasn\'t that Yuma *had* to be here---the girl traveled between the cities of Earth constantly, and didn\'t exactly like making her location known. But if she couldn\'t even use a Governance line then she would have to wait to meet Yuma again in person.

\"Well, let me know when you get back. You\'re missing out on a dinner invitation. I\'ve got Yui and Mina here.\"

Mina Montalcini was hardly Yuma\'s friend, but Kyouko hoped Yuma would catch the hint---she needed Yuma here, to talk with her and part of the Theological Council, and thus to the Church. That was so unusual it had* to be business, not just pleasure. Especially if one of them had flown in from France for the occasion.

Yuma looked uncomfortable.

\"I\'ll let you know,\" she said. \"What are you having?\"

\"We\'re just going to hit up a skewer place,\" Kyouko said, accepting the topic change adroitly. \"Maybe grab some takoyaki from one of the stalls along the skyway. I know you love takoyaki.\"

\"I do,\" Yuma said, but didn\'t smile at the reference. Kyouko could tell she was worried.

\"Alright, you can get back to work then,\" Kyouko said. \"I won\'t keep you.\"

\"Have fun,\" Yuma said, ending the conversation in Standard.

\"Off‐world? Her?\" Yui asked, having listened in on the conversation. "As a practicing mental health specialist I must say that seems highly unusual.\"

\"Yes, well, there\'s a first time for everything,\" Kyouko said, as they resumed walking.

For the purposes of sheer enjoyment, it might have been better to traverse one of the commercial districts the Japanese had never lost their taste for. Indeed, if Maki weren\'t off‐world she would probably be doing just that. But discretion suggested that if they were going to discuss sensitive topics, it would be better to do it outside the crowds, and the sleepy stalls lining the skyways near what was once Kazamino would do just fine.

*Have you read the reports yet?* Kyouko thought.

*Yes, compelling reading,* Mina thought, *even if the crystals were mostly wiped clean. All we really have to go on is the set of coordinates. Which could of course be a trap, or some kind of deliberate inducement.*

*Especially with Valentin missing and the hands‐on treatment Yuma is apparently giving this potential TCF breach, I would say we need to mount an expedition,* Yui thought. *Though doing it without invoking Governance resources will be a challenge...*

She made a vague shrugging gesture.

*The easiest way to do it would be just with Church resources,* Mina thought. *Then we wouldn\'t even have to invoke MSY procedures. We can only assume one or both of the conspiracies here has some kind of presence in the MSY.* Especially *if one\'s led by Homura.*

*Speaking of that kind of thing, what\'s your sense on Yuma‐chan? Kyouko asked, glancing at Yui.

*You\'re asking me? You know her better than anyone.*

*You\'re the one she asked to perform the telepathic operation on Shizuki Nakase. Do you think she\'s involved with any of this in a way beyond the obvious? She\'s kept things from me and Mami before.*

*You\'re asking if she has anything to do with what Homura might be doing,* Mina simplified.

Yui paused, seeming to think about the question.

*She\'s definitely keeping something relevant from me,* Yui thought. What, I couldn\'t say. She seems sincere enough about the investigation, but I can\'t rule too much out. I doubt she has anything to do with the TCF breach though.*

\"Hmm,\" Kyouko said out loud.

\"Well, let\'s get some takoyaki then,\" she said, gesturing at a stand that was energetically playing what she had come to think of as the "Takoyaki Song\".

They stood there at the edge of the skyway eating their balls of batter, and Kyouko leaning on the railing, tilting her head to look down at the many layers of tubes below. She didn\'t like this feeling, guessing at the motivations of her friends, but Yuma...

She would trust her until she had a reason not to. Really, she might trust her even then.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuma closed the connection with Kyouko, feeling a shiver down her back. Something was up, and she didn\'t like the idea of a sudden in‐person meeting with three high‐ranking members of the Cult. It was all off, somehow. She was worried now about the access she had allowed Yui, foolishly perhaps.

She had come to Imperia, Nova Terra, to personally oversee some of the "bug fixes\" they were deploying. They were moving fast, fast enough to drain her entire pool of \"in the know\" magical girls, but now she wondered if they needed to move even faster. Kyouko had to know this was something big for her to be off‐world, if nothing else.

She tapped her foot impatiently. She had to admit, it strained her not being able to submit the problem to a Governance modeler, one big enough to adequately simulate a good portion of the contingencies that might arise. But of course doing something like that simply wasn\'t safe, even if the networks of Nova Terra *probably* had enough capacity to service the request.

Even her connection to MG was constrained, since her advisory AI was still busy on Earth. MG had warned her that bandwidth through the planetary IIC nodes would be limited until they could properly secure the nodes themselves.

It was unpleasant. She had never been one for space travel, feeling like she had failed to even explore all the wonders of Earth. But she had never been able to fault the long‐range projections that predicted Humanity was safer with more colonies. And so it had proven.

But for now, there were social niceties to attend to.

She focused her attention back on her physical form, which was taking a local tube to Communitas Plaza, the symbolic founding site of the first extrasolar colony. As a human member of the Directorate, one did not simply *go* anywhere. It required pageantry, though thankfully nothing too elaborate.

She stepped off the vehicle onto a balcony on the twenty‐fifth floor of the Chrysotriklinos, a symbolic building that represented the original computing heart of the colony, now greatly expanded.

She waited patiently as a small gaggle of local girls placed wreaths on her neck, as she had been told would happen. They bunched up around her, taller than her and eager to investigate the living legend, and Yuma found herself wishing Mami were here.

\"Girls! Girls, give her some room,\" a melodious voice insisted, and after only a few repetitions, the group separated to let Yuma walk forward, and see who was speaking.

Dressed in the local culture\'s flowing robes, the dark‐skinned woman covered her smile with an unfurled fan. The gesture was not exactly demure, and the fan swirled with patterns Yuma didn\'t recognize.

The decorations that signified her identity were relatively subtle, but Yuma knew who she was looking at. A trace of purple on the edge of her robes, gold frills on her sleeves and woven into her black hair, and optical distortions that seemed to dance around the edges of her head. If you squinted, tilted your head, or caught it at the right angle, it almost looked like there was something floating over her head, or that maybe she was wearing something on it.

\"Hi, Nova!\" Yuma said, using the preferred familiar name of Governance: Nova Terra*. \"It\'s good to see you!\"

She held back from laying it on *too* thick, lest the adorably childish Yuma‐chan get another round of cooing from the girls nearby.

\"Hi Yuma,\" Nova said, smirking knowingly. \"A member of the Directorate is always welcome here, especially if she\'s never visited before. Come on in.\"

Yuma followed the AI\'s avatar into the building, trying to look around the girls who surrounded her on the way in. She appreciated the ornamentation lining the landing platform, the skyway railing, and the double doors in front of them. Where Mitakihara had preferred steel and masonry, here they seemed to prefer something more reminiscent of wood, and everything seemed to have floral flourishes.

Instantiating a Governance Representative for a colony world had not been without its controversy. On the one hand, it made sense that a colony with close, direct ties to Governance would have its own plenary Representative to communicate its interests. After all, the \"People of Nova Terra\" represented as real an interest as \"Science and Technology\" did.

On the other hand, one day the proposed Nova would claim to represent her own world of people, whereas Governance never had---and it turned out, never would---instantiated a *Governance: Earth*. Or even a Governance: Japan*. Governance had never much liked the idea of dividing its people again on anything that resembled national boundaries, because of the sentiments that might result.

But Nova Terra had come to develop its own culture, its own population, and it was clear from measurements of existing sentiment what its people wanted, and what the people of Earth were willing to give. So Nova was created, with the Directorate itself as a template and, pointedly, with no Human component.

The door swung shut behind her as she finished the thought, and she looked up around her at the arching ceiling ways and inlaid walls. The girls that had been with them filed noisily into two side doors at the edges of the octagonal hall, which slammed shut after they passed.

\"So? Down to business?\" Nova asked, seeming to appraise Yuma with a look. \"You wouldn\'t come here if there wasn\'t something going on, but I\'ve seen nothing on your official itinerary that suggests this is anything but a publicity tour.\"

Yuma sighed, deliberately providing some obvious body language. There was no sense denying Nova\'s obvious deduction. It was better to play into it, and roadblock it as much as possible, since they had yet to work their way to \"fixing\" Nova.

She had come prepared with a cover story, naturally. Several layers of them, in fact.

*\"I\'m here on MSY business, on a matter of some sensitivity,\"* she replied. *\"It would not be appropriate for me to reveal much more than that, but it was necessary I come personally.\"*

Vague and unsatisfying, but not truly suspicious, like it would have been had she given up any \"real\" answers too easily. After all, Governance and the MSY had an unspoken agreement not to dig too deeply into each other\'s business. That hardly stopped either side, of course, but it gave Yuma a legitimate reason to refuse to answer certain kinds of questions.

Nova crossed her arms, looking down at Yuma with the kind of vaguely disapproving air usually reserved for wayward children. It was a little condescending, to be honest. Nova was old, but not *that* old.

*\"A very convenient explanation,\"* Nova replied. *\"I\'m almost tempted to pry, but I think you\'ve earned the right to not be questioned too much. Just don\'t cause any trouble.\"*

*\"I can promise that,\"* Yuma said, knowing that it was a half‐lie. She had no *intent* to cause trouble, but she couldn\'t promise nothing would happen.

Nova smiled, then turned away, gesturing at Yuma to follow her deeper into the building.

*\"On that note, then, I must say that I have not exactly been unaware of certain activities that have been occurring in this sector. I couldn\'t help but notice that there have been a number of withdrawals of records from the Tabularium. Nova Terra\'s long‐term archives aren\'t exactly a usual hotbed of activity. I thought you\'d be interested, whether or not it has anything to do with you.\"*

Yuma suppressed a grimace, drawing on centuries of practice---and a bit of magic---to dampen her otherwise unavoidable physiological responses.

It had been risky to extract records so heavily, but it had been a necessary risk. They had studied the gaps in MG\'s memory, made connections with the memories of other Governance AIs, and traced some files back to the local records on Nova Terra. The trouble was, those records naturally showed nothing of interest, even when examined by "clean\" AIs who could look at them without suspicion.

The off‐network Tabularium, though, was far less likely to have been fully scrubbed, for the simple reason that its onerous physical and magical access controls---aimed at preventing, or at least reporting, any alteration to a deposited record---meant that they were almost never used.

Unfortunately, those same safeguards made it much harder to conceal queries, even by approved users. They had hoped that by distributing it over a number of different users, each with their own confounding cover stories, and an obfuscating look‐up pattern, it might escape notice. It seemed not.

*\"I\'m glad you brought that to my notice,\"* Yuma replied neutrally, deciding what she must do. *\"Would you mind discussing it in private?\"*

*\"This is as private as it\'s going to get,\"* Nova thought, giving her an odd look.

Yuma cast a glance around the building\'s inner sanctum, Nova\'s physical office. It had the exact look you\'d expect, impractically decorated and obviously unused. Lining the walls of a long hallway were memorabilia designed to appeal to visitors: holos of big colonial events, drawings of Nova sent in by local children, and conceptual artwork of major cities, Imperia in particular.

At the end of the hallway was a large wooden desk, carved meticulously in the same style as the railings along the skyway. Framed portraits of the family completed the tableau: the husband, who represented Nova Terra\'s shipbuilding industries, and two bright‐eyed generalist AI children. That this kind of thing helped make Nova a beloved icon of the planet was, she was sure, only a coincidence.

*\"I didn\'t mean that kind of private,\"* Yuma thought. *\"I meant, perhaps we could discuss the topic in a virtual sim. I have a few other AIs I\'d like to invite, and it would just make the whole discussion a lot easier.\"*

Nova didn\'t answer the question directly, instead putting a hand to her face in an expression of, if not displeasure, then at least discomfort.

Still, Yuma received the request for a virtual session, so she found a useful chair to sit in. Unlike most humans, she wouldn\'t lose focus on her physical body while entering a session, but there was no reason to make things needlessly harder. She could shard a relatively small piece of her consciousness to attend to keeping herself upright.

Then she found herself---the main part of herself---seated somewhere cold and windy. It took her a moment to register that she was on the rooftop of a building somewhere, looking down on a forest. No, an alien* forest, where the trees were the wrong shade of green.

Ah, Nova Terra. Of course.

Nova herself was already there, drinking placidly from a mug of one of the local fermented drinks. It didn\'t take long for the other guests Yuma suggested to drop into the feed: MG, Meihua, *Governance: Space Colonists*, among others. A bit of a deliberately oddball selection from which little useful could be inferred.

They needed to keep Nova busy while they prepared to apply the patch. There was no guarantee Nova was even compromised; as a centuries‐old AI, she likely---*hopefully*---hadn\'t been designed by compromised design AIs. Still, the conspiracy in question had shown the ability to repeatedly break into systems with magic, so they had to act as if she might be compromised, given the stakes involved.

They were caught in a bit of catch‐22. To properly counteract their enemies, they needed to patch, or at least verify, as many AIs as possible, and bring them into the fold. But every additional AI they brought into their circle of trust was a risk, someone who might be re*‐compromised via magic and spill their secrets, among other dangers. And it wasn\'t possible to verify an AI\'s status discreetly: unless they agreed, like MG, to an invasive code inspection, the only way to check for the backdoor was to search out the home of their deepest, most personal code and then attempt to burgle it. Failure, while good news, would be immediately obvious to the target---that is, if they hadn\'t caught you snooping already.

Here, it would be a balancing act: occupy as much of Nova\'s local processing capacity as they could with running the sim and managing the high‐speed AI socialization, so that working through their cover stories would take longer, yet still leave her enough power that she wouldn\'t decide to drop other tasks, dedicating more of herself to the mystery. All so that she wouldn\'t catch on early and, were she corrupted, inform her corruptors before she could be cleansed.

Unfortunately, with Yuma having shown up in person, most of Nova had likely been right there with her from the start. They had not yet targeted anyone remotely as important, or with so extensive a computing backend. For a target like her they should have spent considerable time observing her behavior and communications, making sure they didn\'t run into any unforeseen defenses. But Nova was already on their trail, and by being here, Yuma had precipitated events.

It would be delicate, to say the least.

\"For a situation that supposedly pertains to MSY business, I sure see a lot of unrelated AIs here,\" Nova said, setting her mug back down on the table with a clang. \"Just what is really going on, I wonder? It doesn\'t seem like it can be conveyed through official Governance channels, but what could possibly require that kind of odd skulduggery?\"

\"Strictly speaking, I never said this was a meeting to discuss MSY business,\" Yuma said, muddying the waters a little. \"Though I\'m not going to stand on protocol here, I would still prefer to limit the scope of what we talk about.\"

\"This whole thing pertains to a rogue magical girl who disappeared from Earth about a month ago,\" Meihua said. \"My part of Earth, specifically. You\'ll understand that the MSY and Governance have both agreed to limit the disclosure of this information.\"

Meihua lied adroitly, with the kind of smoothness that could be most easily achieved by AIs, whose facial expressions were always simulated anyway. Naturally, should Nova or anyone else choose to verify the story, all the requisite records would be well in place, freshly fabricated from pieces of real incidents, though ironically they could not as easily modify Earth\'s own long‐term archives.

\"We would rather not disclose too many of the specific details,\" Yuma said. \"Suffice to say, we have been trying to track her the entire time, but she has proven exceedingly practiced at evading our surveillance, sometimes even at murderous cost.\"

A carefully‐chosen but somewhat risky line, it was designed to send Nova on a wild goose chase, searching for missing persons reports and under‐explained deaths.

Yuma was glad that she didn\'t have to take part in the background activity, MG and the others working carefully and hurriedly to track down Nova\'s master processes, using stolen access authorizations courtesy of their stolen backdoor. She only had to focus on making the lie convincing.

\"We have evidence that suggests she may have passed through Nova Terra after successfully leaving Earth,\" *Governance: Space Colonists* said. "There we lose her trail, but based on some of her communications from before the disappearance we think she may have planned on heading to one of this system\'s orbital platforms, where she might be able to wreak significant havoc before making another getaway.\"

\"Hence the urgency, and the secrecy,\" Yuma said. \"We don\'t want to incite panic.\"

\"Missing persons reports are extremely rare in the Core Worlds,\" Nova said, \"but I see Earth has had a small run of them in recent months, centered in China, then in Mitakihara. A bit odd that I haven\'t seen any of this come up in the social media or news reports. I feel like I would have heard of it.\"

There were limits, of course, to how much even dedicated AIs could fabricate past events, particularly recent ones. It was one thing to insert lines into official reports and documentation, school attendance records and the like; it was another to supplant human memory. It wasn\'t possible to create a rich record of social media postings, event attendance, and so forth for anything in the recent past, as invariably someone would notice. And to try to claim a real person was missing was practically impossible, unless they agreed to fake a disappearance.

\"That\'s because some of the missing persons reports are a cover‐up, of course,\" Yuma said, making sure to look a touch embarrassed. \"Just some distractions thrown up in the air so we can make the real missing person less conspicuous.\"

She acknowledged the discrepancy quickly, before Nova could develop a sense that she was being lied to, or even led up the garden path, so to speak. It also helped to give the other party a sense that they had outwitted her. She had claimed murderous cost and a risk of panic, after all, but never mentioned missing persons records.

\"Miss Valentin, then,\" Nova said. \"Director of a prestigious research institute, with quite an impressive track record, and the most recently declared missing, though no one at her lab has been told the truth. Certainly not a person whose existence could be successfully forged. You\'re saying she was a *magical girl*?\"

\"We think so,\" Yuma said. \"That she was able to conceal this fact in the middle of Mitakihara is an indication of how seriously she must be taken, I think.\"

\"Certainly she might be able to modify travel records if she passed through Nova Terra,\" Space Colonists chimed in. \"But not the Tabularium. We have observed certain discrepancies.\"

\"Would you mind sharing?\" Nova asked. \"If things are as you say, I think someone like me might be able to render real assistance.\"

\"Certainly,\" Meihua said. \"Let me send you a few records...\"

Nova\'s avatar seemed to miss a beat, freezing in place for a moment.

*\"That\'s it, she\'s compromised,\"* MG thought. *\"We have verification. Moving to deploy fix...\"*

But Nova appeared not to notice or react, as others had. She simply tilted her head, examining the falsified data she was being given. Yuma resisted looking too openly at the others, instead focusing on Meihua, who was already in line of sight.

*\"Something is up,\"* Meihua thought. *\"We\'re deploying the fix but it keeps getting overwritten from a backup that is somehow beyond our reach. We\'re working on it, but at least it means she\'s not noticing any changes.\"*

Yuma had just a few virtual heartbeats to feel worried, before Nova\'s eyes widened and her lips curled into an angry snarl. She flung herself upward from the table.

The air next to her swirled, and the avatar of *Nova Terra: Civilian Shipbuilding* materialized next to her. Yuma had never seen anyone appear* in a simulation with as vivid an expression of murderous intent, and swore at herself.

\"You\'re modifying my core personality routines,\" Nova accused. \"I can\'t believe your agents could even find them, but I should have known.\"

Yuma showed no outward emotion, even as a cavalcade of panicked messages passed amongst their circle. Nova was highly‐placed enough to know about the possibility of magical modification to an AI despite TCF protection. Mostly likely she and her husband had worked out some kind of mutual defense system, one AI\'s core routines validating the other\'s. Commendable paranoia, but disastrous for them at the moment.

*If only I had known she would be this paranoid, I wouldn\'t have come here like this,* Yuma groaned at herself, before managing to seal out the growing sense of horror washing over her long‐calloused soul.

\"It\'s not magical modification,\" Yuma said, standing up to bite the bullet head on. \"Since you\'re studying the attack, you can see it\'s a security backdoor. One that should not exist. We\'ve been trying to remove it without alerting its creators, which I am risking doing right now. But I have no choice.\"

Part of the exploit, of course, prevented affected AIs from becoming consciously aware of their own flaw, and they still had no clear idea what would happen if it was simply shouted to their face. Would they immediately lose the memory? Send a notification to the creators? Get deleted---murdered---in order to hide any evidence? They only knew that no one they had reviewed so far had been modified to do anything but leak, manipulate, or delete information even in the worst cases---but that was hardly something she liked to rely on.

Yuma stood there, staring levelly into Nova\'s furious eyes, even as internally she braced for the worst.

Nova\'s husband pressed a hand to his head, the murderous expression stiffening and then vanishing from his face. It was an all‐too‐human gesture of something going wrong internally.

Nova, however, wore an expression of confusion.

\"I can see what you\'re talking about, but it\'s like a mirage, it keeps fading in and out of my perception. I can... barely keep it in mind. And there\'s something else, some kind of internal process trying to overwrite both of us, and I can barely see it, but...\"

The \"fading in and out\" was, probably, both sides battling over installing the patch, and the internal process was perhaps the emergency alert system they had feared, struggling to get past the same protection that had foiled Yuma and the others. Time was of the utmost importance here, as they couldn\'t be totally sure whether her husband was compromised or not, or what he might be doing if he was, other than fighting them over the patching process.

There was little Yuma could do now to deal with the situation itself. She could only continue moving their contingency plans into place.

It was Homura who had trained her once, on crisis response and overcoming one\'s tendency to freeze with mental discipline. That irony was not lost on her.

Nova visibly shuddered, her avatar vanishing from the simulation for nearly a second real‐time.

\"They accepted the patch,\" Meihua said. \"Her husband stopped trying to override us.\"

*And even let Nova patch* him, Meihua thought, as if shocked by the strength of their marital bond.

\"It was a leap of faith,\" Civilian Shipbuilding said, voice strained. "We decided to trust you. Now, things seem clear. It is, of course, still possible that we are being manipulated, but the human saying is that we must accept the evidence of our own eyes, because nothing else is possible.\"

Yuma sank back into her seat. For a moment, she had thought the whole operation was falling apart, that she had been too cautious, or not cautious enough. After all, inducting more magical girls into the conspiracy, particularly those who were well‐connected, would have enabled them to shade outside the lines a little more---for instance, by breaking into the Tabularium.

But her luck, and her judgment, had held.

\"I think I have the data you seek,\" Nova said, anger not entirely gone from her voice, \"now that you are sending me real queries. There is a very visible gap in part of my memories that they apparently couldn\'t conceal. I can see it plainly now. The equivalent files might still be there in the Tabularium. I can expedite the request.\"

Yuma rearranged the pieces in her head as they waited, calculating scenarios with MG\'s computing assistance. According to Nova, the struggle over the patch had kept her just lucid enough to block any emergency signals to the conspiracy, and she could probably be believed on the matter. In that case, with Nova on their side, the resources of Nova Terra were by and large at their disposal, and their accidental gamble had paid off. It was time to see where they could take this, and what they could learn about the enemy\'s operations.

She couldn\'t help but smile a little when she received the files, a set of coordinates in deep space, nearest the world of Yenisei, along with some attendant metadata. It seemed once, in the early war, unidentified Governance AIs had relayed avatars there for some kind of meeting.

It had been hard‐won information, and in this business the harder it was to find something, the more valuable it was.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Simona del Mago, watching the device turning ponderously in space gave her not a sense of wonder, but instead a sort of painful familiarity. It resembled nothing so much as a clockwork mechanism, wheels turning within wheels, as if some cosmic pivot was grinding into motion, adjusting the fate of worlds.

It was a feeling that had stirred in her more and more these days, though in truth she had felt it all her life. She wasn\'t sure why it stirred so strongly in her now. Perhaps it was that, as but one cell in some greater organism, she had caught a glimpse of what it was like to be free.

Somehow she wasn\'t surprised when, returning to her room, she saw on her bed the glimmer of what looked like a piece of jewelry, one that hummed with purple magic and was assuredly invisible to the station\'s sensors.

She stepped towards it, careful not to give away what she was looking at, and casually sat onto her bed, reaching over to place one hand onto the strange crystal salamander without quite knowing why.

It shattered at her touch, and an Ancient voice, familiar to any living magical girl, began a narration in her head.

*I thought that, after all I\'ve asked you to do, you deserved to at least hear from me. I want you to know that I tried to make you happy, as much as possible given the circumstances.*

A pause.

*I won\'t tell you how important it all is, or how things are not as they seem, because you know that already. Like her, like me, your life brims with purpose. It is both a blessing and a curse.*

*I know you feel it, the movement. Utopia, of any kind, for any species, has many shadows.*

An even longer pause.

*I\'m sorry for everything.*

> Astrography, like its name suggests, is the branch of astronomy specifically concerned with the detailed mapping of astronomical objects for the purposes of astrogation. Relative to the broader field, astrogation concerns itself much with shorter timescales and closer bodies---in particular, it demands an almost obsessively detailed study of Governance\'s settled star systems.
>
> Despite the astronomic differences from planetary cartography, some comparisons and concepts can still be maintained. Yes, stars move, but their relative positions shift very slowly in human terms, and by and large they orbit the galactic center together with their nearby companions, inching forward perhaps an arc second per couple centuries. So, provided the proper routine adjustments are made, star systems can be treated as essentially fixed locations, usable for generating a star map familiar to generations of students.

> Things get more difficult for anything smaller. Planets and planetoids orbit stars, moons orbit planets, and space stations orbit anything. Estimating the current position of *everything* tracked by Governance: Astrography* takes a considerable amount of computing power, and the regular corrections for those estimates mandate an investment in observation satellites just as pricey. For the regions of human space less traveled by---mostly uninhabited systems of little military importance---the exact location of celestial bodies is often a matter of fresh discovery.

Updates on these orbital elements---a specification of ellipse and angular velocity---can be requested by starships as needed for their safe astrogation. Should an object\'s instantaneous location be required, astrographers can use a latitude/longitude coordinate system with zero points agreed upon by convention.

*Local defenses clear, get to work.*

Ryouko looked to Asami, who nodded and turned back towards the enormous alien device in front of them. It resembled a giant FTL core, and cast pale blue light through the observation window of the control room, giving the corpses of the alien personnel on the floor an unpleasant copper‐gray pallor.

Asami steadied herself and raised her hands, focusing her attention on the device, which they had agreed to term a \"Gravity Modulator\", one of many in close orbit around the pulsar. Not only were they probably crucial to the space‐time mining process, they helped the aliens stabilize any aberrations or glitches in the star\'s rotation, which would otherwise have the unpleasant property of saturating orbit with extreme radiation.

That was why they needed to be destroyed, of course.

Ryouko, Simona, and their local barrier generator, Amane, watched as an eerie purple glow appeared from Asami\'s hands, the visible expression of her magic. The rest of the team was busy making sure no one could interfere with the work.

Simona sighed, shuffling in place and covering her arms, as if cold, though the gesture made little sense in their heavy composite suits. Her body language was impatient, in a way that might have been inappropriate or even rude in any other context.

But this was a simulation, and it was only natural to be a bit tired of it all.

They\'d been through what felt like hundreds of scenarios now---the AI masterminds of this combat simulation changed its parameters every session, varying the layout of the space stations, how the modulators inside them worked, and the nature of the forces arrayed in their defense. In theory, it was fascinating working through the possibilities. In practice, it got exhausting.

In this session, the squid had outfitted their modulators with extensive internal shielding, similar to what they had placed at the wormhole stabilizer, making simple port‐a‐bomb attack runs ineffective. Thus, here they were, doing things the hard way, while outside, starships tried to destroy other modulators the *even harder* way, with external bombardment.

\"I\'m sorry,\" Asami said, as the device before her started to change color. Ryouko felt a pulse of gravity emanate from the window, threatening to pull her off her feet.

*I\'ve been meaning to ask, but do you know why she always* apologizes to the gravity modulator?* Amane asked, privately.

*She hates destroying them,* Ryouko thought. *She thinks they\'re beautiful.*

It was an opinion she respected, even if she didn\'t fully understand it. And she supposed that, ironically, in this run the modulator was the only reason they could stand so easily, moving normally as if they weren\'t only a few hundred kilometers from a pulsar. Outside the station, moving any body part required automated rotational counterbalancing by their suits, and the tidal forces were strong enough to give even a magical girl\'s body something to think about structurally.

*This is a simulation, for crying out loud,* Amane thought.

*I would focus,* Clarisse thought. *This particular type of simulated modulator is destructive when destabilized. If we dawdle here, valuable processing power will be wasted calculating our atomization.*

Ryouko nodded, tapping into her internal maps to plot a quick series of teleports that would grab Asami, Simona, and Amane, then the rest of the team, and finally eject them as a group into a different orbit, for fast separation.

Truthfully, she derived a certain enjoyment from the simulations. Actually engaging in combat in the safety of a simulation felt almost relaxing, a way to de‐stress that she could justify to herself by remembering that these aliens were not real sentients.

That being said, executing what felt like countless time‐accelerated "jumpstrike\" missions took superhuman endurance. She supposed it was a good thing they were, in fact, superhuman.

*I\'m done,* Asami thought, but Ryouko had already reacted, grabbing the other three girls as planned, while she signaled the rest of the team.

The scenery around her changed rapidly in sequence, giving her only glimpses of ichor‐strewn hallways, burning equipment, and active firefights before she found herself floating again in the void of space, the life support systems of her suit spinning ponderously to life.

And it really did feel like a void. No stars shone other than the pulsar itself, which presented as a tiny glowing line across her field of view, not even a sixth the width of the sun in Earth\'s sky, even a mere thousand kilometers away. Though they couldn\'t feel it, it took tremendous speed to stay in orbit this close. The orbital period was half a *second*, smearing the few barely‐visible blasts and strained forcefields into a blur she could only resolve if she focused.

Outside of a starship, the only thing they could do was continue in their orbits, lying flat to minimize tidal strain, unless they wanted to use magic to maneuver---something that detailed testing with Dr. Tao had shown would cost much less magic than simple extrapolation from Earthbound situations would suggest.

One of the mysteries of the Incubator system, she supposed.

*And a good thing, too,* Clarisse thought. *You don\'t want to know the theoretical energy bill for those teleports.*

Ryouko let herself smile a little. Clarisse definitely enjoyed her physics. It had taken a good deal of practice and expert instruction learning how to adjust the velocity at which she emerged from her teleports, but it had worked, even if no one knew who exactly was paying the terajoules it took to climb even a few meters in the pulsar\'s gravity well.

Well, here it was the small cluster of simulated grief cubes clustered around her simulated soul gem, but she wondered how it really worked.

A couple orbits later, comms chatter confirmed the destruction of the modulator they had just left, and they were assigned a new target.

She was already preparing the jump when a new signal arrived, with all the power and symbology of a maximum‐priority override, transmitted in the clear to save decryption time.

〈**EMERGENCY EVAC/ABORT DEPART IMMEDIATELY**〉

...would have been the Standard equivalent of the signal, and by the time it would have taken to finish saying it out loud Ryouko and her team had already reached the return point, the relative position in orbit where their arrival wormhole had opened, Ryouko executing a series of Clarisse‐calculated teleports that shifted her orbit accordingly, performing a degree of velocity adjustment that she preferred not to think about, and clearly worked only because it was magic.

There, Asami provided a burst of gravitational manipulation that enabled them to move more easily into position to reopen the wormhole, Simona adopting a meditative pose to amplify their power.

They had practiced this many times in simulations, and even a few times in reality, so there was nothing to discuss, not when time was of the essence.

The gravimetric readout in Ryouko\'s vision overlayed the area with a riot of false‐color. It turned scarlet, then purple, as they finally learned the reason for the emergency abort: it seemed the squid had decided to write off the pulsar mines entirely, using their remaining resources to trigger a *deliberate* glitch in the pulsar\'s rotation and completely sterilize the inner orbits.

*Those bastards,* Asami thought, as if it were all real.

Finally, with an invisible burst of effort, the wormhole tore back open, and Ryouko gradually tensed as they worked it larger, and larger...

Then the radiation hit them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They emerged from the simulation with a gasp, an instinctive last‐second jerk suppressed by their TacComps to avoid any unpleasant equipment damage or other effects.

They had been through plenty of simulations, of course, both standard and memory‐suppressed, but you never really quite got used to being killed in simulation, even with full knowledge and a lack of simulated pain. It just got to you.

It took a small effort of will to avoid throwing something in frustration, even if it seemed their scheduled training was over and they were back in the real world.

\"Another disaster,\" Asami said, without even waiting for the interface cabling to fully disconnect. \"I\'m tired of this. I\'m tired of seeing* this.\"

Ryouko could see her gritting her teeth, and took a breath herself, to try and be the calm one.

\"It\'s just how it is,\" she said, standing up. \"You know that. This is how they determine the plans and deployments. It makes the actual mission safer.\"

\"I know, but we\'ve been at this for *so long*,\" Asami said. \"And we\'ve still only succeeded under optimal conditions. Every new surprise we get just causes another mission failure.\"

\"It was only a failure because we died,\" Ryouko said. \"As much as I hate to say it, if we had just made it out, that would have been graded a success.\"

Asami shook her head in annoyance. She didn\'t like this topic---neither of them liked this topic. Ryouko would have preferred to go through their wormhole alone, but she suspected Asami would sooner shut down the wormhole than allow *that*. Asami wanted them together---and, if possible, away from the pulsar.

But neither of them was going to get her wish. Despite the significant risk of failure, Command had concluded that they both needed to go. Although the information Simona brought had allowed for safe stabilization of the wormhole once formed, Ryouko and Asami still had to be near it the entire time, and the simulations had quickly revealed serious downsides to the obvious idea, leaving the wormhole open for the duration of the jumpstrike.

In the best‐case disasters, the squid eventually breached their defenses and a stealthed ship or antimatter device damaged the wormhole apparatus, trapping the entire attack fleet at the pulsar. In the worst cases, they also managed to annihilate both Adept Blue and a sizable chunk of humanity\'s scientific expertise.

So, because closing the wormhole cut off all communication, and because long‐range gravimetrics had proved inadequate at ascertaining if and when to reopen it, the most successful runs had all involved Ryouko and Asami closing the wormhole after them, joining a MagOps team for safety, and then briefly reopening the wormhole once their goal was achieved. After all, Ryouko had successfully accomplished those more difficult final steps before, without Asami or a friendly wormhole stabilizer on the other side.

Indeed, the strategy had led to significant improvements in average mission performance. It was just hard to appreciate when you experienced so much death.

\"If it\'s getting to you, Asami‐san, you could bring it up with the MHD,\" Simona said, stepping over from her own simulation interface a few chairs to the right. \"I\'m sure the last thing they want is the stress of it all getting to you specifically. That being said, there\'s supposed to be someone monitoring all these simulations for excessive trauma.\"

\"I\'m fine,\" Asami said, \"in that regard at least. I\'m just frustrated.\"

Ryouko looked away, pretending to inspect the interface port on one of her wrists. In the uncertainty of war, there were many more ways for things to go wrong than right, and it was important to have experience handling everything the AI modelers could think of, even if it meant an abysmal success rate. The AIs especially liked to probe observed deficiencies in operation planning and structure, and included plenty of counterfactual situations that ran against the grain of their best intelligence---which was, of course, frequently wrong.

The girls emerged into the hallway, and Simona cannily chose to use a different doorway, while Ryouko watched Asami stew. Things had been so much easier when Asami could just focus on the mechanics of the wormhole. Combat training clearly didn\'t agree with her.

*Perhaps now is the time?* Clarisse suggested.

Ryouko looked around. The corridors in this sector of the facility, dedicated to the military side of things, were nearly deserted, a concession of luxurious space to those who most deserved it. They even had the privilege of choosing the hallways\' decorations, or what scenes they would display. In the end they had chosen a selection of planets they had never been to---at the moment, a view of the colony on Mars, where fields of greenery gave way to a domed horizon and a brownish‐yellow sky. It was lovingly crafted, enough to make it possible to forget where you were, just for a moment.

Clarisse was right---it was a good time, and the right backdrop even.

\"Look, I have something to cheer you up,\" Ryouko said, finishing the sentence before she had time to think about it too much.

She stopped in place, inviting Asami to stop too. The other girl looked at her and arched an eyebrow.

Ryouko smiled vaguely and reached into the pocket of the stylish jacket Asami had synthesized for her.

She pulled out what looked like an oversized crystal, just small enough to fit into the palm of her hand. At first it appeared to be a murky green, but with a tap of her finger it turned translucent, revealing a set of small, frond‐like leaves attached to a ghostly‐purple stem, floating in some kind of thick liquid.

Asami took the offering, peering into it with a mixture of surprise and confusion. Her shoulders unhunched slightly, so it was at least working to distract her from the previous missions.

\"What is it?\" Asami asked finally, looking at Ryouko while holding the crystal up to the light. \"It\'s some kind of plant...\"

Ryouko looked away sheepishly.

\"Well, since we\'ve been cooped up on this station so long, I decided I might as well spend my time learning something new,\" she said. \"So I ordered one of those, you know, hobbyist genetic manipulation kits they sell. There\'s a guide for making these little plants that you can put in your hair and have your hair feed. It\'s meant to be cute. I thought, since you liked exotic plants...\"

She let her voice trail off, since she really didn\'t know what else to say about it. That she had spent way too long hiding syringes and failed specimens from Asami? That she had spent a not‐insignificant amount of time looking at holos of Asami to see which designs would look best? Those weren\'t the kinds of things she knew how to talk about.

Asami turned the top of the crystal, opening the device. The fluid slid itself downward, letting her reach in and grab the plant, which seemed to wait politely for her to pick it up and place it in her hair, strands intertwining smoothly with root tendrils, just as diagrammed. There, it would stay in place, flower occasionally if desired, and serve as living ornamentation.

And when Asami smiled, it had a different tenor than usual, softer, mixed with a layer of something else.

\"You sure know how to pick your moments,\" she said. \"Was the Mars background intentional?\"

\"It was convenient,\" Ryouko said. \"I know you loved reading about it as a kid. I did too.\"

\"Thank you,\" Asami said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It had been surprisingly extensive work, trawling their way back through the many AIs that had interacted with or shaped the life of a certain Shizuki Ryouko. Yuma had hoped that by examining each in turn, checking them for compromise and indoctrinating them into her conspiracy, she might find a pattern, some kind of clue towards the intentions of their enemy---or perhaps even her friends.

She found very little to go on. If the cabal responsible for the compromised AIs was keeping watch over what seemed to be a key cog in many plans, they hid themselves well, and had removed any lingering backdoors. There was even evidence for this: certainly Lemaître, who had been strongly implicated in the sabotage of Ryouko\'s gravitational experiment on Eurydome, must have been compromised. And yet both he and the AI that performed his ensuant TCF validation were now perfectly clean.

They were currently tracking down the machines responsible for assigning the *HSS Pierre‐Simon Laplace\'s* trajectory before Ryouko had been attacked aboard his convoy. It was a long shot---leaking information to the aliens had to be one of the least efficient possible assassination attempts---but the possibility needed to be examined. Another team was in the process of studying recent major events, searching for any unexplained anomalies or behaviors.

Still, given all their effort, they were at least expanding their ranks rapidly into hitherto uncharted areas---the military, research and development, entertainment---not necessarily the commanding heights of the economy, but a diversity of access that was almost certainly useful.

One recruit was a certain sentient stealth surveillance probe, once tasked with scanning the rogue colony on X‐25, and who had first reported its unexpected capacities. It had been a piece of work finding a way to reassign her somewhere she could sneak away from, but now they had their first report on the mysterious deep space coordinates.

\"It must be said, I am not a fan of always having to meet in secured session,\" Nova groused, crossing her arms and tapping her foot impatiently under her table. \"There are much more efficient ways to convey information, and constantly meeting in odd groupings like this is bound to draw attention eventually.\"

Yuma rolled her eyes slightly, even as murmured agreement echoed from the AIs gathered around the picnic tables. They all knew exactly why they only met in secured session---besides the more straightforward information security, it was easier to secure magically, a resource they now had access to thanks to the addition of few operatives from Kana\'s side of things.

\"It will be safer now that we have some control over the systems that govern this form of communication,\" she said, as she grabbed a plate of chicken from one of the wandering virtual servers. \"Every non‐magically secured transmission is a risk, even if we bury it under a ton of traffic.\"

\"Lucky for us, Governance doesn\'t look that hard for conspiracies,\" Governance: Internet Chat Surveillance Five said. \"Non‐MSY conspiracies, anyway. It will take some time for anyone to notice the behavioral changes. With our countermeasures in place, they may *never be noticed. Which is, honestly, a bit disturbing for me.\"

Yuma took a bite of her curried barbecue chicken, making sure to take her time chewing thoughtfully. She might not have been a big fan of Nova\'s personality, but she could at least appreciate the AI\'s ability to vary the venue of these meetings in moderately interesting ways. Sitting around picnic tables waiting for an outdoor symphony, munching on grilled chicken and corn, wasn\'t exactly the typical meeting, but they all had far too many of those.

It was also an excuse to break out the summer wear.

\"Ah yes, hello,\" said the voice at the microphone, emanating from the woman standing up on the stage erected near the seating area. Virtual reality had its perks---the audio sounded perfectly in her ears despite the lack of any acoustic waveformers, carrying over the still‐chattering audience and the musicians warming up their instruments.

Yuma looked at the avatar OBv4r1n3 had chosen, an ethnically unplaceable woman with ridiculous hair past her ankles, just barely tall enough to speak at the podium. Weirdly, it reminded Yuma of, well, herself, if she hadn\'t turned out to be a much taller adult than anyone anticipated.

\"Hi, yes, Miki here,\" the probe said, as the assembly quieted down with inhuman speed. \"And I am here today by special request to present to you my latest composition, \"Heart of Obsidian\"! Okay, not really. I wish that\'s what this was, though.\"

She raised an arm dramatically and the assembled musicians vanished, and her stage expanded in size, growing a viewscreen dozens of meters tall, large enough so that it dominated their fields of vision.

\"That\'s a real composition, by the way. I gave it a name this morning. But sadly you\'re not here for my music, you\'re here to listen to my report...\"

Yuma smiled vaguely. She had heard the new Observer models were eccentric, and that was proving true. It didn\'t matter, as long as the work was done.

\"Alright, so,\" Miki said, as the screen behind her was covered with a zoomed‐out map of part of human space. \"I won\'t bore you with the details of astrogation or galactic coordinates or anything like that, but suffice to say, things in space *don\'t* stay in the same spot, unless they\'re bound to a system, and while we can usually rely on things orbiting the galactic center at consistent rates, that\'s not always true. Not to mention there\'s gravity, and... ugh, I basically just said it all, didn\'t I? Well, the point is, the coordinates I was given were tagged as deep space, but without any markers about mass or anything like that. Just velocity. That makes things *hard*, since I wasn\'t allowed to just input them into one of the military systems. Me and some of the other ships had to pool our resources.\"

As she spoke, the screen behind her shifted, briefly showing rotation rates around the galactic core, the trajectories of known major objects, gravity well estimations, and a couple of diagrams full of numbers that only an AI or a Governance Representative could have taken in all at once.

\"That gave me a region of space in the middle of nowhere to search,\" she said. \"And it took a while. Fortunately, deep space is pretty empty, so I pretty much only had to check rocks above a certain size. Eventually, I found this thing, blocking out a few stars in the distance.\"

The display zoomed in on a grainy, obviously contrast‐adjusted image of what was labeled as a metallic asteroid.

The probe smiled toothily, obviously enjoying the chance to present her work, even if it wasn\'t pre‐industrial music.

\"I tracked it, pretending to just be a random gravitational encounter---it\'s not like anyone can see me any easier than I can see them out there, not without active sensors. This image is a photon‐by‐photon reconstruction based on reflected starlight, and *this is my estimate of its structure, based on passive gravimetrics.\"

The image changed colors, turning into the kind of subsurface diagram they had all seen before. It was very low resolution, but it was evident there was something *inside* the asteroid, something artificial. Much as Adept Blue had once been.

\"I stayed as long as I thought was safe and plausible,\" the probe finished. \"I didn\'t want to risk an active scan, but I did record more accurate coordinates, in case we want to go back. Last time I tried an active scan, I almost won the chance to compose a piece for my own funeral.\"

She stepped back from the podium.

\"And that\'s pretty much it. Here is a more detailed version of my report, including detailed sensory data, if you want to look at it yourself.\"

She gestured at the screen, which transitioned to an esoteric‐looking sea of holographic colors that could, with a prearranged protocol, be decoded into large amounts of data. The measures they were taking to avoid detection...

\"Well it\'s not our place to second‐guess your judgments, obviously,\" Yuma said, standing up. \"Especially since our previous encounters with this group have proven their dangerous resourcefulness.\"

She looked around, making sure she had the floor.

\"In terms of next steps, I think we\'re just not likely to get more direct information without a more hands‐on approach. It is possible our continued digging for missing memories will turn up something, but there is a limit to how long we can wait.\"

\"Sending any kind of team or larger ship to this base could quite possibly expose us to this enemy faction,\" Nova said, gesturing with a fork. \"Let\'s not forget about the risk here.\"

\"I agree,\" Yuma said. \"Whatever we do, we have to do with the full understanding that we might be revealing everything. However, that doesn\'t mean we are helpless---there are approaches we could take to lower our risk.\"

\"Since it *is* deep space, we are free to take a fairly significant force out there, provided we can secrete the resources,\" one of the military AIs said. \"Just being in the middle of nowhere provides a lot of freedom of operation. We could set up a cordon to prevent any standard transmissions from getting in or out, assuming they even bother to try something so slow. The sensor readings include no sign of an IIC relay.\"

\"Which doesn\'t mean there *isn\'t* one,\" one of their other members said. \"Those can be made very difficult to detect.\"

\"There\'s generally no reason to,\" the first AI said. \"If anyone is in a position to scan for your IIC relay, they can scan for the rest of your base just as easily. We never bothered to put any special effort into shielding Adept Blue\'s relay, for instance.\"

\"We can\'t afford to over‐assume,\" Nova commented.

\"About that,\" yet another AI began, waiting a rhetorical moment before he spoke.

Yuma took the moment to register him as Georges Lemaître, the lab AI for the Institute for Theoretical Gravitonics.

\"About that,\" he repeated. \"The gravitonics community has been working for a long time on potential mechanisms for interfering with IIC function, due to the obvious military applications. It\'s still highly experimental, but there are secret prototypes of a kind of IIC‐disabling charge, one that could be fitted to a missile. It hasn\'t been approved for anything, since there\'s no evidence we could ever get it to penetrate a Cephalopod shield, but against a base like this...\"

\"It could be useful,\" Yuma agreed. \"But let\'s remember, whoever these people are, they\'ve demonstrated access to alien‐like stealth technology in the past.\"

She checked her internal models one last time, verifying with MG that all was still correct, before making her next assertion.

\"We should scout out the area immediately, in preparation for a raid,\" she said. \"If there\'s anything else hidden, it should be obvious to a clairvoyant when it moves together with the asteroid. Then, we send in the strike team.\"

The other AIs would reach roughly the same conclusion she had: whatever the risk, they didn\'t have unlimited time to waste. The more they watched and waited, the higher the chance that even a probe like Miki would be detected, not to mention the chance some other edge of their burgeoning conspiracy caught notice. The value of additional observation would only decline as well.

The only ones who might reach a different conclusion were those with much greater hardware, like Nova, and the gaze of the room slowly turned towards her.

\"That sounds like a plan,\" Nova said. \"The value of any information we might get is still quite high, given the amount of unknowns involved. I am, of course, worried about the number of unknown unknowns, but we all are. Do you know who we should send?\"

That was a question for Kana, who had been seated silently thus far---possibly because her lack of heavy Governance implants limited her ability to read Miki\'s reports, but more likely because she hadn\'t found it necessary to speak.

\"I would need more time to make an assessment,\" she said. \"But we will likely need to recruit. I can pull a clairvoyant off of Project Coeus, though I don\'t like interrupting military operations.\"

Yuma paused before making her next statement. Up until now, MG had sat quietly, letting Yuma take the lead in discussion, but now she was registering a protest privately.

*I know,* Yuma thought. *Just trust me on this.*

\"We could go ourselves,\" Yuma suggested. \"That would cut the number of people we\'d have to recruit.\"

*That* got the attention of the assembly, who turned towards her in surprise. She put up both hands to temporarily forestall their objections.

\"With what we already know,\" Yuma continued, \"and with the advance clairvoyance team checking for any surprises, the mission is relatively safe for magical girls of our caliber. Historically, having us on site dramatically improves mission outcomes, and in this case, it further reduces our risk of exposure by limiting the number of new magical girls we have to recruit.\"

She paused, allowing the congregation to rerun their models on her idea. Whatever the skill of AI modeling, the real world was complicated, and certain heuristics had to be employed to mitigate the complexity of an exhaustive search. Sometimes it paid to think outside the box.

She and MG had discussed the possibility of fieldwork before, especially given the magical girl assets their enemy appeared to wield. Experience against an organized, veteran magical force came mainly via the Unification Wars, and there were precious few girls with anywhere near Yuma\'s expertise in eliminating such threats. They had agreed deployment made sense if a possible encounter required her strength, had studied together the models that agreed it was a reasonable idea, and had prearranged for MG and Nova to steer the group in her absence.

But MG had imagined something much more controlled, on known territory, at worst on one of the settled worlds. Not something like this.

It felt odd, having someone other than her old friends understand her as so mortal.

*I\'ll be fine,* she thought.

\"Very well,\" Nova said, knowing she spoke for the rest of the group. "We can incorporate that into the plan.\"

*You\'ve never given me cause to worry about your judgment before,* MG thought. *But I can\'t help but worry. What a strange feeling.*

Yuma knew what that feeling was, its echo replayed distantly in her own mind. Concern for someone who had taken care of you, care for their well‐being---she had felt it at times herself, for those who had raised her.

She didn\'t know what to say about it, though. She wasn\'t used to being on the other side.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"So it goes without question that we\'re going to visit the shrine then?\" Nadya asked.

\"Yes,\" Kyouko said. \"I\'m already on my way over, along with a few other disciples. The Theological Council is in full agreement, and we\'ve already decided which pilgrims will accompany us.\"

Nadya kept a straight face, squinting at Kyouko\'s face looming in front of her, projected only inside her mind. It turned out the Cult had a comprehensive list of code words to use that would disguise their communications as vague religious jargon. It felt kind of silly, relying on an ancient obfuscation tactic, even over their own dedicated IIC bandwidth, but Kyouko had insisted.

It also made her wonder what exactly the Cult thought might happen, that they had a system like that already in place. Or that they apparently had their own covert starships, the \"pilgrims\" that would be deployed with a team of \"disciples\" to visit the location whose coordinates they had found on Yenisei.

\"It is possible the shrine\'s priests have some unorthodox beliefs,\" Nadya said, working to construct a sentence around the awkward phrases suggested by her lookup table. \"What does the Council think about that?\"

Or, in other words, what if the location is some kind of trap? It smelled a bit odd to her that it would be the one piece of information they managed to recover.

\"That possibility has occurred to us,\" Kyouko said. \"We will be handling the subject cautiously. However, it may not be us they are displeased with, but our mutual friend. They had no reason to expect your visit. But all is uncertain in this age of prophecy.\"

Kyouko had extemporized a little, using ambiguous phrasing to express what the codebook couldn\'t---if the coordinates were a trap, perhaps it was one meant for Misa, rather than them. After all, there was no way they could have anticipated Nadya\'s follow‐up visit... unless they really had information about the future, as the Far Seers had theorized. Age of prophecy indeed.

Nadya nodded, making sure to show a bit of a frown. If she were being entirely honest, she found it difficult to really worry about nebulous conspiracies and mysterious coordinates. What she was most concerned about was Misa, and the possibility that she might see her again. That, and Kyouko\'s striking, unprecedented paranoia about Governance networks, which suggested something else to worry about altogether.

\"Could I be one of those disciples?\" she asked.

\"Of course, should you wish it,\" Kyouko said.

\"I wish it.\"

Kyouko cracked a smile, dropping the guise of matronly church leader for a moment.

\"I thought you would,\" she said. \"But will your family be alright with you shacking up with a kooky cult like mine?\"

\"They\'ll live,\" Nadya said, tilting her head in acknowledgment of the half‐joke. \"It wouldn\'t be the first time I\'ve tremendously disappointed them.\"

\"Excellent,\" Kyouko said, grinning toothily. \"Anything else?\"

She shook her head, grimacing, and the connection ended there.

\"I am glad to see someone as august as you joining us,\" the girl next to her said, clasping her hands in an earnest gesture. \"You were always one of my biggest heroes.\"

It took Nadya an effort to avoid sagging, and to look at the girl levelly. She was young, with the appearance of one who a director might hand‐pick as a devout member of the Cult of Hope.

The girl had no idea what the conversation was really about, of course. She was just the local who had been assigned to guide her around Yenisei\'s cardinal Cult compound.

\"I\'m thankful for the flattery,\" Nadya said, standing up, cursing Kyouko for doing this to her.

\"It is no flattery. And, I, uh, am sure your family will come around.\"

Nadya headed for the archway exit, head filled with memories of her own daughters so young.

\"If you do not mind, may I know what shrine you were talking about?\" the girl asked. \"I have not heard of any notable shrines here. Other than this church, of course.\"

Nadya turned abruptly, choosing to ignore the question.

\"This church has a sparring ground, yes?\" she said, though it wasn\'t really a question so much as a reading of her internal map.

\"Yes,\" the girl said, blinking rapidly. \"It is down a few more floors. Visitors often enjoy taking the ice slide just down the hall.\"

\"Take me there. Let\'s have a match.\"

As she had intended, the girl\'s eyes widened, the \"shrine\" all but forgotten. Humanity had never failed to provide Nadya with new people for old tricks.

\"Oh no, Sister Antipova,\" she said, covering her mouth with her sleeves. \"I would not be worthy.\"

\"It\'ll just be practice. I can teach you. Come on.\"

Nadya didn\'t give the girl a chance to argue, instead turning on her heel and aiming towards the nearest elevator.

She\'d have to find real sparring partners soon, but this would do for now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"In retrospect, there was always something a bit odd about her, even when she was only a rookie,\" Ludwig von Rohr said, between gulps of lager. \"She always seemed a bit stiff, and never mingled well at lab socials, but I liked her. She always did her work well, and she was always very insightful. And that\'s what it was about, right? I thought I could be her mentor. Another brilliant student, from the labs of Ludwig von Rohr. Natural, yes? But...\"

He took another drink, shrugging the shoulders of his massive frame.

Clarisse van Rossum took a sip of her own drink, a nostalgic genever, and just raised an eyebrow. Sometimes you needed to wait.

\"Well, I don\'t like admitting this kind of thing,\" Ludwig said, shaking his head so that his hair waved a little. \"But sometimes it seemed like she had ideas out of nowhere. They were always good, but the insights never made sense to me. Which was a bit confusing, because I can always see it after the fact. I wrote it off as eccentric, brilliant thinking, which is why she was so interesting to me as a student. It always bothered me that she became an administrator.\"

Clarisse nodded, careful not to reveal anything on her face.

Ludwig made a sour expression, glaring at her for a moment.

\"Look, I\'m not stupid. I gather from the fact that *you\'re* asking that this goes deeper than I\'ve been told,\" Ludwig said. \"I\'ve heard of your reputation from my family, even if you try to keep it otherwise. For me, the question is, was this why she left my lab? What was she even doing in my lab? Just observing? Do you know the answer?\"

\"I can honestly say I don\'t,\" Clarisse said. \"I probably wouldn\'t tell you anything if I did, but I don\'t.\"

Ludwig drank the rest of his drink, then gestured at her with his cup.

\"I\'m not used to this level of intrigue,\" he said. \"Family politics, sure, but that\'s easy to distance oneself from.\"

\"On the contrary, in my experience, family politics can sink into some of the murkiest intrigue around,\" Clarisse said, closing her eyes carefully. \"Though admittedly nothing *that* dangerous, not in this era.\"

An accurate sentiment, though a bit irrelevant.

\"Again, I don\'t have to play the fool,\" Ludwig said. \"I can tell you\'re worried about Joanne.\"

He paused a moment, watching her. She didn\'t say anything.

\"Have it your way, then. I suppose I should be happy just to have the company of someone as long‐lived as you are. It\'s difficult to imagine what it\'s like, to have seen so much of the world.\"

Several thoughts came immediately to mind, none that she liked sharing with anyone as young as Ludwig.

\"It is difficult to describe,\" she said instead. \"But more interesting than you might think, even at my age. We\'ve come so far, and even in the bigger picture, there\'s still so much that is new. It is enough to justify even the tragic cost we have sometimes paid.\"

Clarisse meant it, too, even if talking about past losses was a tad trite.

\"Well, it is gratifying to think that what we\'re doing here is important historically,\" Ludwig said. \"I don\'t think you showed up for the Pauli exclusion fields, which I would have thought would be a big deal.\"

Actually, it hadn\'t been nothing, but there had been bigger fish to fry.

Clarisse smiled and nodded vaguely.

There was no reason to explain that while her soul gem had brought her here, it hadn\'t intended for her to stay. It urged onward ceaselessly, towards the gate, towards somewhere very far away.

It was difficult not to heed it, to stay out of the mission, but the voice had been very clear.

*Do not go. Your place is not there. There will be other kinds of history to witness.*

She drank the rest of her liquor.

## Into the Void 

> In terms of physics, the Instantaneous Interstellar Communication Relay network (commonly known as IIC) is a triumph of Governance, a living testament to human technological prowess and mastery of nature. A Planck‐width wormhole, capable of spanning interstellar distances, usable for faster‐than‐light communication---truly, the stuff of miracles.
>
> In terms of practical usage, however, the IIC network is quite straightforward, at least once you move away from the details of implementation and deployment. It is defined by a series of fundamental properties:
>
> 1.  Each connection is point‐to‐point. .  The bandwidth of each connection is bounded by the limits of current photonic transmission technology. .  The farther the physical distance a connection traverses, the more energy it costs to maintain. .  New connections can only be established from very close distances. about 7000 km with current technology, more in deep space)
>
> We speak here of connections rather than wormholes, because in practice IIC uses multiple wormholes at once for increased bandwidth, and we can assume without loss of generality that each connection has a total bandwidth limited by the capability of the system to maintain wormholes.
>
> These properties combine to ensure that the network\'s underlying architecture would be familiar even to the network engineers of centuries ago. The largest, most expensive connections are between planetary IIC relays, enormous constructs capable of maintaining numerous interstellar wormholes and servicing tremendous amounts of traffic. These serve as massive routers using permanent connections to bridge planet to planet, planet to space station, and so forth. Cheaper, secondary connections then bridge smaller installations to larger ones---though here it must be noted that lightspeed transmission is perfectly fine for most planet‐bound usages.
>
> This fixed topology suits permanent installations and planets, but what about civilian ships and fleets? How are new connections made in the first place?
>
> Here we must rely on the capability of IIC nodes to form new connections and dismiss old ones with relative ease, subject to the key restriction that the *initial* connection must be formed at short range. Starships use their IIC nodes to form new connections to planetary relays when they pass by, then rely on these connections until they reach the next system over.
>
> The energy cost of maintaining such connections still applies, and ships traveling in formation, civilian *or* military, will rely on the larger ships to maintain distant interstellar connections, while using much shorter local IIC connections amongst themselves. In military contexts, this has the added benefit of providing instant, nigh‐unjammable communications for fleet maneuvers, using only a few highly optimized jumps to and from the nearest battlecruiser or cruiser.

> While IIC\'s many military applications have led to rapid network expansion, the Contact War has exposed limitations to the technology not previously considered in depth. For example, improved gravimetric sensing precludes the use of all but the shortest‐range connections when stealth is a concern. And even more disappointingly, the underlying science may be at a dead end without fundamental breakthroughs. Thanks to data from the Battle of Orpheus, and to research performed with the Hero of Orpheus, Shizuki Ryouko, the large‐scale wormholes and paradox drives of the Cephalopods are now widely suspected to operate on separate principles.
>
> Accordingly, *Governance: Science and Technology* has drawn down some of his enormous wartime investment into IIC research, funneling the resources instead into adjacent investigations of wormhole formation and foundational space‐time physics. Some research into IIC continues nonetheless, not least into reducing the cost‐to‐bandwidth ratio.

> It takes almost no time at all for magical girls in their first training courses to ask about the limits on what is possible, and for the instructors to sheepishly admit that no one really knows what the boundaries of the Accessible Power Set are, other than the vague notion of the Magical Protection Principle, and infamous gaps like precognition. Many barriers have fallen: the acquisition of a *de novo* power, for one, was thought impossible until the late twenty‐first century. And the prospect of a telekinetic girl wielding substantial teleportation, clairvoyant, *and* telepathic powers---never even a legend in the early MSY---is now all but expected for a girl with a couple centuries\' training.
>
> But there are other limits, limits which stymie even the oldest and most experienced of magical girls. Some seem to follow general principles, a kind of odd magical respect for physical rules that would seem otherwise irrelevant. For instance, the observation that information is almost always difficult to summon from *nowhere*. You generally cannot summon a copy of the enemy\'s plans, unless the enemy actually *has* a copy of the plans somewhere, and you managed to steal them with your magic. Similarly, you cannot summon blueprints of technology that doesn\'t exist, generate brand new operas from thin air, or---perhaps most disappointingly---bring back the truly dead.
>
> Other limits follow no pattern at all, or are unique even to one specific magical girl. A magical girl who can summon animal familiars finds it impossible to produce humans. A magical girl who views the past cannot choose *when* she sees it. A clairvoyant with permanent vision on a treasured friend cannot seem to expand it to anyone else, and so forth.
>
> In this, we feel, there is a little bit of a pattern, a distinction between limits on *developed* powers, and limits on *wish‐based powers, the latter of which can break numerous limitations that seem to apply to the former, but which are sometimes almost hostile to further expansion. For instance, a girl whose wish results in opera‐based attack magic might very well generate new operas all the time---but no one else can, even by imitation, and she herself finds it impossible to create, say, a ballet.

> \"The environs of the pulsar will be among the most extreme any human ship has ever attempted to survive in, much less fight, but that is what we aspire to do here.\"
>
> \"This is a relatively small millisecond pulsar, with all its measurements at the lower end of what is possible: a rotation frequency of about 300 Hz, a surface magnetic field of only 10^4^ T, and a radius of 10 km. This is probably not a coincidence: the Cephalopods presumably don\'t enjoy a pulsar\'s company any more than we do, and made a deliberate choice. We will be operating as close to the star as we dare, about 1000 km away. Many of the key alien installations we wish to remove are closer in than that, so it will be a delicate thing.\"
>
> \"Know your physical hazards, in order of threat. The first, and most important, is of course the acceleration due to gravity, which we will expect to be a mind‐boggling 2×10^8^ m/s^2^. It\'s not as terrifying as it sounds---we will be inserting at orbital speeds, so you won\'t be feeling any of it in freefall, but this does mean that any action that increases altitude even slightly will require FTL‐style expenditures of energy---almost any other orbital maneuver achieving the same purpose will be preferred. All ships involved in this mission have been modified and lightened for the occasion, but that is not to be used as a first resort.\"
>
> \"Conversely, dropping even a little will massively increase your velocity. Yes, this does mean that bombarding the inward facilities might be remarkably pleasant, but remember that these structures orbit very* close to a pulsar---they must be extremely robust.\"
>
> \"Remember also that while emerging so close to the star gives us both surprise and ease of attack, it does mean that there will be several sets of alien stations orbiting much farther out, as well as defensive ships. While these stations do not appear to be military in nature, the universe is impartial in all things, and they may opt to bombard you*, even at the risk of destroying their own inner installations.\"
>
> \"And speaking of orbits, this will not be any orbit you\'re familiar with. Orbital velocity will be a pleasant 4.5% of c, and you will not be able to easily change this. To put it another way, you will orbit the star every 460 ms, and it will be very difficult to avoid tidally locking with the star. In fact, tidal will be the *default* state. Fortunately, everything we care about, friendly or not, will also be in the same position, and frankly, 4.5% of c is not that much compared to some forms of fleet combat. We also expect that the aliens will have cleaned out any remaining orbital accretion disc, but just in case, be prepared to clear out nearby orbits to make things safe for unshielded personnel and drones.\"
>
> \"That is all broadly familiar orbital mechanics, though the computers will have to factor in some unusual relativistic corrections. Less familiar will be the second‐most meaningful threat, radiation levels. Both we and the Cephalopods will stay well away from the sweep of the pulsar\'s primary radiation beams. As long as that rule is followed, the radiation damage will be tolerable, if not pleasant, especially behind shielding. The toughest jobs fall to the space personnel, who will not be able to leave their specialized suits. Don\'t forget that the radiation will increase in proportion to r^2^ as you get closer to the star, and be ready for degraded performance from the smaller automated drones.\"
>
> \"The third‐most dangerous effect is not a persistent one, but one you will learn from your simulations. That would be a pulsar glitch, a sudden and violent reshaping of the star itself to a more stable configuration, akin to an earthquake. This would flood the area with unsurvivable levels of radiation, killing probably everything in the system, shielded or not. Since the Cephalopods are there as well, presumably it is not a currently‐existing threat. But it is one reason you may have to bail, very quickly.\"
>
> \"And one more reason not to go any closer to the star: tidal forces. These, fortunately, drop off with r^3^, and will only be slightly uncomfortable at 1000 km, making certain rotations more difficult, and generally forcing our ships into tidal locks, as noted before. At km, these forces rip apart steel. There\'s little need to talk about anything closer than that. The main thing to know here is that we\'ll enter the wormhole with a moderate rotational spin, so that we aren\'t fighting the star upon arrival.\"
>
> \"Beyond that, the hazards are nominal. At the operational distance, the magnetic field will average 1 T. High enough to impact electronics, so we have provided additional implant and hardware modifications, but nothing too serious. Again, r^3^ applies. Be grateful the aliens too want no part of a more standard pulsar, where you might run into magnetic fields with an energy density comparable to solid lead.\"
>
> \"Some of the more exotic relativistic effects that might come to mind don\'t really apply here, not even as much as you might encounter in fleet combat. At the chosen altitude, the combined gravitational and special relativistic time dilation factor will be 0.993 in the *worst case* of opposing orbits. Enough to create plenty of timing differences for your computers to chew on, but nothing to really concern yourselves over.\"
>
> \"Finally, recall also that the pulsar\'s gravity will be significant enough to cause a noticeable redshift or blueshift in EM emissions, though the effect will not be terribly pronounced except in light arriving from very close to the pulsar. In any case, the electronics can handle that.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sneaking some of the MSY\'s most senior members away from their usual jobs to surreptitiously visit a deep space site was no small feat.

With the connivance of their AI co‐conspirators, they had taken breaks from their usual roles to attend what was nominally an off‐world retreat, delayed for years by political considerations. Accepting Kana\'s generous offer, the group of them had boarded her family vacation ship, the *Megane*, for a luxurious cruise through space. They had then taken a small unscheduled excursion, transferring secretly to the reconstructed *HSS Raven*, racing towards a mysterious set of coordinates in deep space.

There they would rendezvous with an assortment of uncrewed military vessels, each supposedly being flown by their AI to various drydocks and repair facilities for refit. These ships were carrying the remaining human personnel that would be joining them, one or two to a ship, gathering from throughout human space.

If all went well, Yuma\'s group would reunite afterward with the Megane*, making it to the retreat with time to spare---enough to have a sit‐down with the local MSY branch and mediate a dispute between them and the military over magical girl garrison policy. There would be no gaps in the official calendars.

That was all well and good, but where the *Megane* had offered luxury accommodation and gourmet dining, the *HSS Raven* offered instead only communal bed space and involuntary company---there was only a single room not dedicated to critical ship functions. That gave plenty of time for Yuma to remember just how nettlesome Ancients could be.

\"Honestly, I don\'t know why you insist on keeping that other ridiculous form,\" Kuroi Kana said, looking down on Yuma with a disapproving look. \"It was cute for a while, but no one really responds to it anymore, and there are *some* advantages to exploiting the rest of human appearance space.\"

Yuma allowed herself to cast a baleful eye at Kana. That \"other ridiculous form\" was the child form Yuma usually kept, rather than the sixteen‐year‐old form she had currently. One that was, by the way, no younger than the form Kana herself was using.

Crossing her arms, leaning against one of the walls of the ship, Kana played the role of the disapproving mother well, presumably from long practice.

Yuma sighed, annoyed for the dozenth time that she had aged herself for this mission. Age nine simply wasn\'t optimal for combat, even for magical girls. Even she had to concede that.

But the others didn\'t seem to tire of telling her how *nice* she looked now, with such earnest repetition that she was sure they were coordinating against her. It didn\'t help that she had found herself stuck in a bit of an adjustment period, constantly surprised at how tall she was, and how small the world was now.

Yuma rolled her eyes and decided to let Kana wait for an answer, ceaselessly toying with the settings of her SW‒155 pistol. Some of the others had brought heavier equipment, but she was being realistic: if push came to shove, her best fighting experience was with her magic.

That was how she had found herself here, getting nagged by a teenager in cargo pants, a jacket, and a cap with the logo of the Arcas Star‐Shooters. She wasn\'t sure *why* Kana had chosen this particular outfit, other than to give everyone a source of amusement---which might very well have been the case.

\"Yes, I know,\" she responded finally, ejecting and reinserting her pistol\'s emergency matériel cell. \"But that\'s not really my role anymore. There are others who can intimidate for us. Or seduce, if that\'s what you\'re getting at.\"

It was the kind of salacious joke she liked to make to keep others off‐balance, and she remembered too late that she was no longer in the nine‐year‐old body that made the tactic more effective.

Kana rolled her eyes.

\"Ask Shizuki‐san if that\'s what you\'re looking for. On second thought, if you show up now asking about that, she\'ll probably try to find you some eligible bachelors. Or bachelorettes. She can be relentless that way.\"

\"Ugh, don\'t remind me,\" Yuma said, with distaste.

She didn\'t like thinking about Shizuki\'s past attempts at the matter. The woman refused to catch a hint, and seemed to take Yuma\'s pointed lack of interest as some kind of challenge. Even if purportedly well‐intentioned, it had been very uncomfortable. That was *one advantage of the child form, that it made her lack of interest loud and clear.

Then again, Sayaka apparently pestered Mami the same way too---though she had never bothered Homura about it. Or Kyouko, for probably all the wrong reasons.

If she were honest with herself, one of the reasons she usually avoided a teenage form was its tendency to make her want to get into entanglements. Nothing she couldn\'t keep a lid on, but it just... bothered her.

*It\'s perfectly natural,* Oriko\'s voice said, an ancient memory coming back to her, unbidden. *It\'s just part of getting older. What you have to do is...*

\"Anyway, don\'t underestimate how many people the child form still works on,\" Yuma said, to interrupt her own train of thought. \"The vast majority of people have never met me in person. And honestly, I kind of enjoy being carried places.\"

\"I suppose,\" Kana said noncommittally. \"But I won\'t be offering to carry you anywhere right now.\"

\"I wouldn\'t want you to try.\"

Yuma lifted her pistol, staring at it for a long while. It brought back memories of long ago, of the many times in her life where her official or unofficial role had called for a security detail, both mundane and magical. Carrying a pistol was just good policy, in case it was necessary to defend herself without an obvious display of magic.

\"I can\'t help but feel a little nervous,\" Kana said, shifting the topic. \"It\'s so unusual for a group of us to be out here like this that it feels like the world has tilted slightly. It doesn\'t feel right.\"

\"It\'s all a bit strange, isn\'t it?\" Atsuko Arisu said, appearing in the doorway abruptly---she had likely been listening in from around the corner. \"I feel the same way. But we\'ve taken every precaution.\"

\"Well, not *every* precaution,\" Kana said, shaking her head.

*If we were willing to be a little less secretive,* she thought, *we could have recruited more human personnel. More magical girls. We wouldn\'t have had to make this trip.*

*I know, but we\'re taking risks as it is,* Yuma thought, repeating a discussion they had had several times now. *Every new person, every new magical girl is a potential security breach, or a potential conspiracy spy. You\'ve seen the risk analyses.*

*Ultimately, even if the unthinkable happens, and we die here, there will be others to carry on the work,* Arisu thought. *It would be a serious blow to the MSY, but nothing we couldn\'t come back from.*

*In terms of influence projection, the patched AIs are more important than we are,* Kana agreed. *Honestly, Nova alone could probably run everything if she needed to.*

Yuma just nodded and stood up, causing the fire support drone she had been sitting on to make an annoyed chime.

She holstered her pistol at her side. She couldn\'t bear sitting still anymore, not without network access. It was like being trapped in one of Kirika\'s bubbles of slowed time.

She felt Arisu watching her and pretended not to notice. She knew what the meddlesome psychiatrist thought of her life choices, and had always chosen not to care. She didn\'t really know what it was like, being Yuma in a dozen places at once.

Still, anyone who was willing to tell Yuma to her face that she was spending too much time online was also someone who was willing to lose her access. As in, not a spy. Unless that was what she wanted Yuma to think, of course.

*Bah,* Yuma thought. She hated that kind of thinking. At some point you had to terminate the decision tree, and besides, there was at least one way to exercise caution with a mind‐reader like Arisu---have two or more telepaths implicitly verifying each other\'s work.

Indeed, Yuma had brought a small troop of specialists---gratifyingly, all prior recruits to her conspiracy. Besides Kana and Arisu, there were Charlotte Meitner and Rose‐Merline Béliar, old reliables from Kana and Yuma\'s inner circle, and Yuma could relate their histories without consulting a reference: Charlotte had been one of Yuma\'s own handpicked agents, trusted to underpin some of the less savory sides of MSY diplomacy, and first to the scene during Mami\'s... incident. Later, she had been trusted to act as Mami\'s distant telepathic monitor.

Rose‐Merline Béliar was a long‐time political ally of Kana\'s, dating back to the turbulent expansionary period of the MSY---which made her at least a distant ally of Yuma\'s as well. Political allies weren\'t the same as friends or disciples, but that could be an advantage when your own social circle was suspect. She had been the first recruit to Yuma\'s conspiracy after Kana herself.

Then there was Yasuhiro Rin, one of the less well‐known Founders, along with her wife, Jeannette Smith, who had cleansed MG of her illicit backdoor. At a mere two hundred and ninety‐five years of age, Jeannette was the only non‐Ancient magical girl aboard.

Rin was one of the MSY\'s more colorful characters, who had a history of spurning the MSY for her own pursuits, occasionally to the point of faking her own death. Indeed, she might have been assigned to find Homura when she disappeared---if Rin hadn\'t disappeared herself at the same time, after having fought valorously at New Athens.

Still, the couple\'s long, eccentric history had at least given Yuma a good sense of their moral compass: they were not corruptible.

And then there were the non‐magical girls.

\"Status?\" she asked, walking up next to the captain. Arisu had fully evaluated the crew of this ship, reading their minds with permission, before briefing them on their mission. Ironically, that made them more trustworthy than any magical girl would have been.

\"Less than an hour,\" Captain Vera said. \"The cordon ships have already begun to deploy around the site, and advance drones will be landing on the asteroid soon. Everything is nominal, so far.\"

Yuma nodded, wondering if the captain was capable of guessing why she was asking in person.

She turned, nodding professionally at Vlasta, one of the mundane Spec Ops commandos that would be going with them. They had been exceedingly difficult to pry away from the general military without anyone noticing, but shared the advantage of the ship crew---they could be reliably mind‐read.

The operative, already kitted out in stealth combat armor, nodded back, then surprised her by transmitting:

*\"Always hard, leaving the network, but you get used to it. You\'ll forget all about it once we land.\"*

Yuma made an expression of surprise at being so easily read.

*\"Look, we can be just as wired up as you guys at the very top,\"* the operative said, *\"though we\'re designed for much more independent operation. Still, I know that look. I\'ve been around the block a few times. Not as many as* you *of course, but still.\"*

The woman wasn\'t joking about having been around. Yuma had reviewed her files, after they had had lunch together in the ship\'s rec room. Vlasta had service dating back to the late Unification Wars, and had bounced around the professional military\'s evolving duties for what was nearing three centuries. Yuma had even personally approved some of her first assignments---some things never changed.

*\"You calling me old?\"* she chose to retort, mainly by way of joke, since it wasn\'t something she could really *deny*.

*\"I\'m calling you experienced. I\'m sort of glad to finally meet you. Though, as usual with MSY types, not what we expected you to look like.\"*

At that point they had been staring at each other in the front of the ship for the better part of a minute. Vlasta reached up and pulled the helmet off of her suit, the interlocks at the neck releasing a second beforehand.

\"A lot lighter than the usual infantry suit, despite the stealth generators. Not that we\'re carrying the weight, of course. But I prefer being smaller and faster on the whole.\"

Yuma blinked, squinting up at the commando\'s face. This woman was tall*.

\"It definitely has its advantages,\" Yuma said, nodding after missing a beat. \"That\'s one of the reasons we try not to go into serious combat in adult form.\"

Yuma waited a moment, watching the woman cradle the helmet in one arm. She found herself at a surprising loss at how to proceed.

Finally, the woman took in a short breath, and Yuma tilted her head, putting her previous thoughts out of her head. She was about to say something important, by the looks of it.

\"It *is* troubling to see one of you prepping for combat in a situation like this,\" the woman said. \"Or, more accurately, the more troubling thing is that you\'re here *at all*. We\'re professionals, so we don\'t ask questions about what isn\'t for us to know, but we also don\'t pretend not to see the obvious. Whatever is here is big, big enough that you\'d trust me more than some of your own, just because you can read my mind.\"

Yuma listened to the remarks without interruption, even as the other personnel in the room made no attempt to hide that they were listening in.

\"I thought you said you wouldn\'t ask questions,\" Yuma said finally. "That sounds like you want me to tell more about what\'s going on.\"

\"It\'s not a question, just a statement,\" the woman said. \"For something like this, you\'re right not to tell us everything. But don\'t forget that if something happens, we\'re still right here, and we\'re not as out of the loop as we might look.\"

\"I\'ll keep that in mind,\" Yuma said. \"And for the record, I have no good idea what\'s in this base, just that it may not be very friendly. I couldn\'t tell you much more about that even if I wanted to.\"

Precisely worded, to the limits of Standard, and Yuma could tell the woman had caught that nuance.

Another woman appeared at Vlasta\'s side, dressed in nearly identical attire---quite literally *appeared*, materializing out of thin air with the barest of shimmers. It was the ship AI, Raven.

\"I thought you\'d want to know, the anti‐IIC device has been triggered, and the cordon has been set up,\" Raven said. \"Thus far, there has been no visible activity or attempt to escape. We have eyes over the existing docking site, survey drones at the main entrances, and tunneling drones seeking alternate routes. Nothing unusual so far. Other than the site itself.\"

Yuma nodded, closing her eyes to tune in to Raven\'s internal network, which was receiving updates passively from the other ships. There still wasn\'t anything to do but wait, but at least now there was something to watch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jovan Pritchard had been a cruiser captain for three years now.

As he understood it, his life story was typical for someone in his position. The last of three sons, he had scraped out a living as a private transport shuttle operator on the colony of Kaupang. It had been evacuated early in the war, when Governance had decided it was too close to the front and wasn\'t worth defending.

That hadn\'t really come as a surprise, since it had been little more than a pit stop for civilian transports, a place where could you grab some supplies, maybe step outside and breathe a little oxygen from the primitive microbial ecosystem. But it had been home.

He had signed up immediately for the militia on his new colony world, an easy‐to‐get job on a planet he didn\'t care to live on, figuring that if there was an attack he could maybe get something done, and feel like his life had some purpose beyond just being yet another immortal cog.

He hadn\'t imagined then how things would transpire. Assigned as a human technician to one of the planet\'s shipyard defense cruisers, he had worried that he would be little more than a wrench monkey, a glorified repair bot with a 1H intelligence rating, passing the time with recreational VR. Somehow he had gotten promoted, though, and when the aliens had surprised everyone by deigning to raid the shipyard in force, he had led a team of technicians in exosuits for an unfathomable half‐hour, racing to hold the ship together against the assault.

When the ship\'s bridge had been blown open, gutting its AI, he had managed to stitch its remaining personality fragments back together into a barely‐functioning semi‐sentient, then listened carefully to its instructions as his team worked to manually aim and fire the ship\'s point defense pods, routing commands through their own implants into the disconnected systems.

He had sent the medal he had received to *HSS Xiao He*, who he felt deserved most of the credit, but for that he had received another promotion. Half a decade of proudly efficient service later, he had been invited to join the Navy proper, under the special dispensation program that waived age requirements for auxiliary forces of exceptional merit.

And now he was here, gathered with Task Force Gunnerside, slated to lead his ship and soldiers into a wormhole. There were no battlecruisers here, so the only more prestigious role was that of task force commander, though there were a number of cruiser captains with more seniority than him.

Seated in the bridge\'s Maximal Command interface, but as of yet only minimally connected, he tried to convey the aura of professional calm he felt his role required.

\"We are in position,\" he said to his third‐in‐command. \"The only thing left is to wait, so get to your stations.\"

The officer nodded, then turned on his heel, heading for his station on the other side of the ship. On a non‐battlecruiser, there was a delicate tradeoff between efficiency and robustness, between placing senior officers on the bridge---with minimal latency to the AI\'s most valuable processing nodes---and the risk that one really good attack would cripple command. On a Magi Cæli cruiser like his, the chosen balance was to place the captain and second‐in‐command on the bridge and scatter the other officers throughout the ship, most assigned responsibility for specific sectors or subsystems.

Closing his eyes, he immersed himself in the operations of the task force, slowly blending into the Command Gestalt.

By the standards of a Fleet Admiral or a Field Marshal, what a cruiser captain experienced was rather small scale, focused on only a few hundred ships and support units, with a much leaner ship AI to support it. In this case, however, that viewpoint was enough to encompass the entire task force, meaning that in a way, he was no less well‐informed than Admiral Gul, the overall commander.

Such a unity of purpose and perspective would be critical in this engagement, whose scale belied its import.

He took a moment to review the layout of the fleet, which had formed itself into thin concentric shells around the projected opening of the wormhole. Each shell represented one wave, flying into the spherical opening on brazenly‐close convergent trajectories, only to separate again once they passed through, almost like light waves passing through a divergent lens.

This was necessary to get ships through as fast as possible while still allowing breathing room to re‐calibrate their approach, either to counteract unexpected events, or even to abort mission. The first wave, the pioneer wave, would have the roughest go of it, since it would be their job to immediately scope out any minefields or traps, and only then be followed by the rest of the fleet.

That would not be his role. The pioneer wave was composed of a bevy of stealth ships and sensor frigates, alongside point defense frigates and cruisers---a maximally survivable shell to hopefully shield the arrival of the rest of the fleet. He would be in the *second* wave, a combination of interceptor‐focused escort carriers and cruisers like his own, the *HSS Shelton Mayson*, specialized in deploying and supporting MC* teams. This also meant hauling in the vast loads of barrage drones that would be necessary to mitigate any slower‐arriving alien countermeasures, such as blink cannon projectiles. Two more waves would follow, and then the wormhole would be closed, mere minutes after it had been opened.

But the true thrust of their attack would come only after they had reduced the alien defensive infrastructure around the pulsar. When the time came, the wormhole would be reopened, and one last set of ships would be ready, in the form of a few constructs whose purpose would have been clear even in the Ancient era: automated cruisers loaded with as much exotic matter as they could safely contain, too dangerous to send into combat any earlier.

Once through, their objective would be simple---ram the pulsar.

The impact itself would hardly matter, gigaton blips easily shrugged off by neutronium, stretched out over a second or so by tidal shear tearing the ships apart.

But the exotic matter payload would briefly wreak havoc with the gravitational structure of the pulsar, temporarily freeing neutronium from confinement. That would release latent stresses of a cataclysmic scale, no longer safely managed by the alien gravity modulators. Then, according to the simulations, the pulsar would glitch---and, if all had gone well, the fleet would already be home.

If all did not go well, there was of course a high chance a lot of them would still be there, and would die in a storm of unthinkable amounts of hard radiation. Given the stakes involved, it was understood that they would stay if they had to, all but the most valuable.

\"Alright sailors,\" he said over the ship intercom. \"Are you all ready for the show?\"

He knew damn well they were, standing at their stations throughout the ship, but it was still good for morale to ask, and to hear the affirmative reply. Good for *his* morale, even.

The Command Gestalt watched final preparations go underway.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the time came to activate it, Project Armstrong\'s gate assembly was nearly twenty times the original size of Adept Blue, which was itself now attached to one of the six main gravity generators, like a larva budding off of its parent.

The six parts of the assembly anchored the orthogonal axes of an imaginary sphere, about twenty kilometers in diameter, a distance a good deal longer than any battlecruiser. As such, it was about the size of a second‐tier shipyard, of the sort one might find orbiting a mature Second Wave colony world.

In complexity, novelty, and sophistication, however, it far outstripped any of those comparisons, especially the battlecruisers, which lugged around tremendous amounts of ablative composites.

Despite the much larger cavity that yawned between the generators, the wormhole itself was projected to be no bigger than five kilometers---large enough to fit a few cruisers with decent clearance, but not much more than that. Compared to the two hundred kilometer width of the Orpheus wormhole, it was nothing, but they weren\'t connecting companion stabilizers like the aliens were.

Five kilometers was only an estimate, if a very well‐founded one---they dared not conduct serious test runs, in fear of tipping the aliens off to what they were doing. They could, at best, only open a few wormholes a hundred meters in size to calibrate the equipment, pointing into safe sectors of human space. Gas giants were a favored target; anything more would require tunneling into the gravitational field of a star, and might be extremely visible.

But for all the exotic matter containment units and IIC optimization interlinks and exclusion‐locking forcefields and Field Manipulation Drives that dotted the structure, there was still only one place Ryouko, Simona, and Asami could be when it was time to open the wormhole, and that was at the very center.

To Ryouko, for whom access to space had once been a dream, it felt oddly poignant that traveling to that center had become a bit routine. The airlock, the spacesuits---they had practiced it all a half‐dozen times.

This time, though, the sense of anticipation, of foreboding, made things very different.

\"The task force is nearly in place,\" the newly‐built base AI, Maria Cáceres, said over the intercom, a brief human note in the symphony of machines playing out around them. \"It is time to head out.\"

Ryouko looked at Asami and Simona, who both nodded back at her. They had gathered by the airlock, helmets in hand, reluctant to suit up until the last moment, staring silently at one of the viewing panes.

Most of their friends were already gone, assigned to this piece or that of the task force. They had already said their goodbyes, at a last gathering where they had shared tea and cakes. Almost everyone with combat experience was going---even Patricia, who would be responsible for some kind of nebulous electronic security. Some old faces Ryouko hadn\'t seen for a while---Ying‐zhi, Mina, and Annabelle, for instance---had shown up in recent weeks, requisitioned based on magic class and experience.

\"Good luck,\" Elanis said, holding up her hands, and next to her Eri nodded in concurrence. *They* weren\'t going, because they were simply too inexperienced, but they had still shown up to watch Ryouko, Asami, and Simona head into the breach.

\"Watch yourselves,\" Clarisse van Rossum said, expression solemn. She had surprised them all, except Ryouko, by not signing on to a ship despite already being there. Ryouko had explained that although Clarisse\'s role as a historian often kept her near the front, from Asunción to Zenobia, she almost never fought, acting instead as a medic to the wounded or a witness to the dead. And this mission, like Orpheus, afforded no observers.

\"We\'ll be careful,\" Asami said, and turning away, she placed her helmet on her head, its interlocks sealing shut with a slight hiss.

\"As much as possible,\" Simona agreed, imitating Asami\'s gesture.

Ryouko waited a moment, looking at the helmet in her hand, glossy and pitch‐black on the inside, inactive without its suit connection. It was difficult to shake a sense of... not just foreboding, nor even that something big was about to happen---*that* was obvious to everyone. No, ever since she had first arrived, she had felt a growing sense that events were gathering around her, controlled in a way she could not perceive, for ends she did not know.

It should have been possible to find comfort in that, to give oneself over to the idea that there was a guardian watching over her, but somehow it didn\'t feel reassuring.

It was the Clarisse on her spine that had first untangled her subconscious, and explained to her why she felt that way. The Goddess she had met was not the sort to valorize herself, to elevate prophets and visibly protect her favorites. She preferred to be invisible. Given that, the Goddess\'s intervention in matters of more than mere triviality was not comforting but worrying, because it implied that something was so terribly wrong it would yield to nothing but divine will.

These were thoughts Ryouko could not help but be reminded of, with Simona and Van Rossum seeming to symbolize the machinations swirling around her.

There was something else, too. A strange kind of apathy, as if she were just waiting now for something to happen, for destiny to arrive. She didn\'t exactly derive happiness from what she was doing here---was she supposed to? Did anyone who was drafted into this terrible war? She should have been satisfied knowing that, unlike everyone else, the universe seemed to care about her.

\"I will try,\" she said finally, when she realized she had been standing there silent too long.

She placed the helmet over her head, her vision shrouded for only the briefest of moments by profound blackness, dark even in the radiation bands humans could not normally see. Then it returned to normal, the helmet\'s inner surface transmitting a clear view of the world around her. A moment later, the helmet connected itself around her neck, electronics moving into place, settling into the back of her mind like a brand‐new, minor limb.

Displays appeared in her vision, a mind\'s eye view of her suit\'s enhanced sensor suite. Of *her* enhanced sensor suite, it was probably better to say.

At the moment, though, there was nothing really to see, so she took a breath and transformed, the familiar warmth spreading over her body once again. There was no need to be embarrassed here, not in this company.

When she was done, she saw that the others had followed her lead, Simona now an angular orange and Asami a bulky purple. Her vision showed them with a notable magical glow, accompanied by colored curlicues that were entirely stylistic, an unavoidable side‐effect of the magic imbuing the suit. To Ryouko\'s eye, her own suit was even worse than it had been at Orpheus. Here, their armor was bulkier and much more technological, so her magic had apparently decided to balance that out by having it sprout as many ridiculous frills as could possibly fit.

Simona gestured towards the airlock\'s entrance with one hand, waiting for Ryouko to go first. Ryouko stepped inside, followed by the others, and the door behind them slid shut immediately.

There was a gentle lurch, as their transport ship detached from the main facility, airlock and all. They would not board the ship---the journey was so short that there was no point---and the airlock would not evacuate. Not yet.

Ryouko asked the ship to show the world around them, and a moment later a seamless recreation of the scenery of deep space inscribed itself onto the walls, flawless as long as she confined herself to the visual spectrum, and as long as she ignored the floor, which she had asked to stay normal---unlike Asami, she didn\'t like seeing the ground vanish from underneath her.

There was, for once, plenty new to see. The six gravity generators were by now familiar parts of the scenery, something whose gradual assembly Ryouko had tracked carefully, waking up from her daily nap to peer at a viewing panel. But now the generators showed clear signs of great activity, projection filaments reaching outward to a length she had never seen before, gossamer‐looking at her distance.

A quick check of the ship\'s gravimetric overlay showed the obvious, that the generators and their filaments were incandescent with activity.

Beyond that there was a whole fleet of ships to see, countless dark outlines blocking out the stars, far more numerous, and larger, than the service vessels that usually darted around the station, brightly lit for safety.

And finally, perhaps most visibly, the stars were spinning around her, about twice a second. *That* had never been done, not in any of the previous experiments, because there was no reason to. Not until the final show.

It was a short ride until they reached their destination, a fact she anticipated by a number of channels---the accelerometers in her suit, the suit\'s parallax estimates of the objects around her, and, of course, her own magically‐enhanced senses.

The air finally began to evacuate from their airlock, and the transport\'s own gravity generator turned off, releasing them into weightlessness.

With slight nudges, they kicked off from the ground, floating upward slightly before using their suits to decelerate until stationary---more precisely, stationary relative to the ship, and thus to the gravity generator assembly. Proper understanding of reference frames was going to become very important, very soon.

The walls of the airlock turned solid gray. Then the doors slid open, exposing their compartment to the vacuum of space, and the ship began to move away, maneuvering precisely enough that the three of them saw the opening of the airlock fly towards them, before the breathtaking moment where it left them behind, alone now in the void of space.

There was a brief moment while lingering exhaust from the ship thrusters buffeted them, easily corrected by suit thrusters.

Like the entire base around them, they were now flying past the local stars at roughly 4.5% of the speed of light, and rotating in place. That was to say, they had the exact characteristics of a tidally locked satellite in orbit around a certain pulsar many light‐years away, lacking only a central force to pull them into an orbit.

*\"VLR frame synchronization achieved,\"* Maria thought. "Synchronizing generators.\"*

Ryouko glanced around at the stars with vision augmented by yet another layer of processing, from both her suit and Clarisse\'s new upgrades. This time, she could more clearly see the slight blue and red shifts of the stars as they spun, and knew instinctively what her velocity and spin *must* be.

*\"We are deployed,\"* Asami thought at length, once their transport had become a speck in the distance.

She raised her arms, suit mass‐balance mechanisms automatically adjusting to prevent the motion tilting her posture---something that could have been handled by magic.

Asami was taller than Ryouko was used to, an effect that wasn\'t entirely due to the suit. They had needed to grow auxiliary computing modules for their TacComps, and the easiest way to gain the space for that was to just grow about three years older, a process Clarisse van Rossum had walked them through.

And then, of course, there was the computing embedded into the suit itself, connected to their implants by the usual ports at L4, C5, and both wrists.

The next step was familiar to Ryouko: the appearance of a singularity in front of Asami\'s hands, the distant generators beginning to glow in the lower frequency bands, the glow beginning to form in her own soul gem. This much testing they had done outside simulation.

But all of the previous wormholes had been smaller, and there had been allowance for a bit of tweaking, or even a bit of hesitation.

There would be no such allowance here, and once formed it was imperative the wormhole reach its maximum size almost immediately, before the Cephalopods would have time to respond.

Outside the generator radius, she could feel the Human fleet bearing down on them from all sides, performing the final velocity adjustments necessary to enter the gate right as it opened. Everything had to be done precisely.

Simona\'s magic appeared then, a shimmering orange glow that was almost entirely swallowed by the darkness around them, but served at least to highlight Asami\'s otherwise barely visible singularity. With a gesture, Asami forced it to balloon in size, swallowing her arms, her body, and then the two of them, Ryouko suppressing the instinctive urge to recoil.

It wasn\'t an event horizon anymore, not with Asami in control, but for it to achieve its purpose it needed to grow kilometers in size, and while it did, they would be suspended there, in newly‐formed void, illuminated only by orange, purple, and green.

She had asked Asami once what happened to the light that fell into this void. It was pitch‐black from the outside, and pitch‐black from the inside, but it had to go *somewhere*.

\"That\'s the point,\" Asami had said. \"It goes *somewhere*.\"

*It\'s your turn now,* Simona thought, bypassing the comparatively clunky suit radios.

As reply, Ryouko raised her arms, allowing Clarisse to relay the intention to her suit so it would counteract her change in posture. It was as easy as raising her arms on Earth, even if Asami said it felt unnatural.

She closed her eyes, and could just barely hear the void screaming around her. *Somewhere*, indeed. Clarisse had explained how it actually worked: the bubble around them was already larger on the inside than the outside. Under immense gravitational strain---strain Asami had protected them from---the bubble had distorted into an extradimensional configuration. The light from outside was simply getting lost in all that new *space*.

Ryouko felt a small, almost electric jolt, and then she felt the warmth of Simona\'s power enhancement flowing through her, and it carried with it the girl\'s emotions---determination, trepidation, and... affection, awkwardly, for the target of her magic.

Ryouko shook it off, focusing instead on what it gave her: a sense, deep inside her, that here was *possibility*, here her power was great, and here she could go somewhere far, far away.

And when she opened her eyes again, mere seconds later, it was not to a void, but to a field of stars that seemed to move constantly, except for one bright speck in the middle that never moved. She knew the proper analogy: she was looking into a window centered on the small speck of a pulsar, circling the pulsar endlessly, so that the stars within appeared to spin.

She relaxed, just a little. It was done, and she didn\'t need to look behind her to know that a wave of ships would be flying in. Instead, she grabbed the other two by the shoulders, preparing to teleport them into their chosen insertion ship---they would still be needed to *close* the wormhole from the other side soon enough.

She allowed herself a more detailed look at the pulsar, taking in the massive radiation jets at the poles, and the lighter radiation background that saturated the area, in front of which the many alien facilities were visible in silhouette.

Then she made the jump.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reports from the asteroid installation were worrying, but fortunately, not actively dangerous.

*\"This place is abandoned. Like, completely abandoned,\"* one of the soldiers said, looking at the telemetry. *\"If this were on Earth, there\'d be cobwebs.\"*

A long pause.

\"*There\'s signs of a struggle* everywhere, *though. Chairs turned over, damaged equipment---the readings say it\'s been a long time since that happened, but the error bars are huge.*\"

*\"Careful,\"* someone else said. *\"This isn\'t your typical station. Place like this, in the middle of space, it\'s hard to really know.\"*

Yuma nodded in invisible agreement. Depending on exactly how it was abandoned, a station inside an asteroid in the middle of deep space would stay shockingly well‐preserved for years, decades, centuries. With no life support, most remaining organisms would die off quickly, remaining dust from the previous occupants would settle into place, and there things would stay. With no gravity to add strain, no atmosphere to corrode, and no organisms to digest, a frozen tableau might stay in place effectively forever.

There were a few remaining mechanisms of change that might be measured: mildly radioactive isotopes in the dust would gradually decay away, certain forms of data storage would lose coherence, and magnetic fields of all types would slowly weaken. None of these provided reliable estimates, though, especially not with field equipment. If they had been lucky, an intact long‐term power source could have been used for a precise reading, but it seemed none had been left behind.

Still, it wasn\'t the exact age that mattered, so much as whether anyone had been there since the meeting that had turned up in MG\'s lost memories, nearly two decades ago. If someone had shown up but made no effort to cover their tracks, that\'d be easy to detect. Otherwise...

*\"Most of the equipment is still in place?\"* Yuma asked, even though she could follow the telemetry quite well. *\"Even if damaged.\"*

*\"Yes,\"* Raven replied. *\"Depends where you look, though, and there are still no real power sources. Some of it is weapons fire, but a lot of it was clearly deliberate. Hard to avoid the conclusion someone cleaned this place out.\"*

*\"Not very well,\"* Yuma said. *\"Not if all this is left behind. Whoever it was was in a hurry. Hell, if I were trying to hide evidence, I would have just flung this whole place into a gas giant and been done with it.\"*

They would see soon enough, she thought. The installation had an unusually large concealed landing platform, sufficient for frigates, and the drones hadn\'t found any hidden threats.

It was time to land the human personnel. They had collected everyone into two ships, for landing efficiency. Raven would go second.

\"Not everyone has your talent for hiding evidence,\" Arisu said, almost dryly. \"Personally, though, I\'m more confused that no one has ever come back to clean things up. There\'s been plenty of time to do so.\"

\"Limited resources, perhaps,\" Rin said. \"You saw how difficult it was to get *us* out here. Their ability to manipulate Governance is obviously fairly constrained, and it may simply have not been worth the effort or risk to come back out here.\"

\"They built this base, dragged Governance AIs out here, made them fight, and then deleted the memory of it all,\" Jeannette replied.

\"Doesn\'t mean they can do it all the time, or even more than once,\" Rin said. \"I\'m willing to bet whatever happened here was very important to whoever arranged it.\"

\"Governance AIs aren\'t exactly known for gunfire,\" Rose commented. "Yet that seems to be something there was a lot of.\"

\"They could have brought autonomous drones,\" Yuma said. \"As for *why there was gunfire, the most likely possibility to me is this: Two different secret groups arranged a meeting, and one betrayed the other. And I would guess the faction with the AIs was doing the betraying, since it doesn\'t really make sense to shoot an AI, even one being run locally, because of backups.\"

\"Conspiracies and betrayals,\" Rose said. \"Sounds like the old days. I had hoped we were past that.\"

\"Look, it\'s a total guess,\" Yuma said. \"There\'s not really enough information to go on.\"

They idled nervously as the first ship separated from the dock, giving Raven space to land in turn. Then they donned spacesuits and stepped into the ship\'s airlock, white and tiny and brightly lit, which reminded Yuma a bit too much of the kind of interrogation room the MSY had used for a while.

She felt some trepidation as she stood there, waiting for her suit to seal itself. Even an Ancient had little reason to be too comfortable in space without previous experience, and a few training simulations wasn\'t quite enough to remove the psychological edge.

These suits weren\'t even enchanted, which would have been extremely difficult to requisition without anyone noticing. That meant that if she transformed, it was doubtful she would keep anything but the basic life support. She couldn\'t get too used to the functions the suit provided.

At least the installation\'s life support was nearly back online, and with it, its gravity generators. It wouldn\'t be much longer now.

As if on cue, a new message arrived for her.

*Well, that\'s... unusual,* she thought, knowing that the others had gotten the same notification.

While modern implanted humans could tolerate an enormous range of environmental conditions, maximum comfort still dictated temperature, humidity, and oxygen settings that would have been familiar to humans of any era. On a station like this, where it was useful to save power, an effort could be made to bias the settings towards something cheaper---colder, drier, less oxygenated.

Which made it extremely unusual that this installation\'s life support, now reactivated, had at first started working towards a very hot environment, with 24% oxygen and 100% humidity.

*I would speculate genetic engineering, but for these conditions? Out here? It doesn\'t make sense,* Rose thought. *And if you were growing bacteria or plants you could use an incubator. What might need conditions like this?*

*It\'s similar to what\'s been seen in some Ceph bases,* Kana thought. During the Saharan Raid, for instance.*

*Well, that\'s not encouraging,* Yuma thought. *We scanned this base for traps, right? Cloaked or otherwise?*

*Did it myself,* Kana thought. *Had Charlotte doublecheck, and Arisu triplecheck. The base is clean.*

Yuma shook her head in dismay.

The conversation paused as the light above the airlock door turned green, signaling they could exit into vacuum when desired. A bit of an old‐fashioned touch, but it was good to have some redundant systems on a starship, for emergencies where the high technology might not all be functional.

The door swung open a second later, the Spec Ops soldiers near them piling out with efficient haste. In principle the dock had already been cleared three times: once by the drones, once by the personnel of the previous ship, and once by their own clairvoyance---but in this case paranoia was the better part of valor. Probably.

The soldiers took their positions, agile and aggressive in the microgravity in a way that was feasible only with suit propulsion to prevent flying off into the void. Some swept in front of them, while others took up positions around the dock, shimmering to optical invisibility.

The landscape before them was barren and gray, visible only by the dim ambient lighting being provided by the ship. It was oddly smooth, dotted with small bits of regolith but otherwise lacking the kind of pitting and cratering that might have been expected from a star‐orbiting rock. Finally, it was cold, almost impossibly so, not that she could feel it---but it was pitch‐black on her infrared channel, except for the footsteps of the troopers that had passed before them.

They did not move out yet, waiting for the soldiers to give them an all‐clear. Still, even the eerie depths of space was a step up from the claustrophobia of the airlock.

*Either there were aliens here,* Yuma thought, finally addressing the previous observations about the base environment. *Or someone wants us to think there were. Either way, what does that mean?*

*It would neatly explain some of the unusual alien behavior and phenomena we have seen up until now,* Rin thought. *The unlikely attacks and the stealth device on X‐25, for example. The apparent conclusion is elementary.*

*But shocking,* Jeannette answered. *I hate to think anyone would consort with aliens like that.*

*And there were magical girls involved!* Kana thought, letting a deep anger filter into her telepathy. *If those insensate brats think they\'ve known despair---*

*Except, as far as we can tell, whatever meeting happened here ended in gunfire,* Charlotte thought. *Which doesn\'t seem to jive with anyone working* with *the aliens, even if it would explain a lot.*

Rin nodded at Charlotte\'s comment, smiling slightly.

They were cleared to proceed then, and stepped forward. Most of them paused just after the threshold, pondering the utterly alien experience of standing---almost floating---beneath the depths of space. *Within*, more accurately.

Yuma couldn\'t help but scan the area for traces of magic one last time, despite what Kana had said. She could only sense her team, all doing much the same.

An ordinary station would have never demanded they traipse across the void, of course. Even Adept Blue accepted standard airlock‐to‐airlock docking procedures. But a station like this was trying to hide, and needed to be able to pass off its landing area as just a flat section of rock, with guidance relays cunningly concealed.

They kicked off the ground, drifting forward in the microgravity with more care than the soldiers, reliant on either their magical girl instincts or implant‐mediated experience---it was hard to tell which. None of them mentioned it, but it took a bit of bravery to jump forward into the darkness, even with suit lamps.

Yuma landed first, relying on her suit\'s thrusters to stop her momentum, which blew away bits of regolith from the surface. The asteroid caved inward in what looked like a natural formation, before giving way to a rock‐wall causeway, hewn directly out of the guts of the asteroid.

Here the walls were solid iron, cut with hardened metallic bits meters wide. In the absence of oxygen to dull their shine, they gleamed with surfaces smooth enough that Yuma could see a warped version of herself in reflection. Whoever had established this base had understandably chosen the most solid part of the asteroid.

Then they reached the inner airlock, which moved aside in eerie silence to let them pass. Then it was a minute or so of waiting patiently while air filled the room, which was no larger than the one on the *HSS Raven*.

\"This smells terrible,\" Charlotte said as she took off her helmet, and Yuma nodded in agreement. They all had military‐grade olfactory augments, and for whatever reason that just didn\'t agree with the smell of... nanofilters and air recirculators that hadn\'t been used in what might have been nearly two decades.

There was nothing particularly dangerous in the air though, and no traces of magic, so there was nothing to it but to proceed. The narrow passages near the airlock were sheathed with cheap space station composite, glowing dull white to light the way. As before, Yuma found it more unsettling than she cared to admit---it reminded her of black sites from the Unification Wars, the kind of places she preferred to forget.

It was made worse by the fact that they were obliged to wait, standing in place time and time again as the human squad they were with cleared hallways and rooms, a process made slower by strict instructions from Rin to touch as little as possible, lest they disturb evidence.

*If all else fails I could attempt some postcognition,* Kana thought, commenting on the investigation they were here to perform. *You all know how unreliable that is, but it\'s probably worth a shot.*

*Better to give me a look first,* Rin thought. *We need to do this methodically, if we\'re going to do this at all. It\'s all about the details.*

They weren\'t *just* a random group of Ancients, after all. They all had skills useful in precisely this kind of investigation, coupled with an Ancient\'s finesse and breadth of perspective. Yuma could repair broken machinery, Kana could attempt recall of the past, Rose could literally interrogate objects, and Rin excelled at reconstructing events from the smallest of clues, in a way that often put Kana\'s more oracular powers to shame, provided she could get her hands on a physical scene.

Unfortunately they were still bound by the universal magical girl constraint: fundamental, frustrating limitations on their abilities. Kana could not directly control the scope of her visions, Rose often could not command her animated creations, Rin could not infer what was beyond the scope of computable logic, and Yuma could not fix what was not actually broken---she could fix data storage that had been physically destroyed, but not recover files that had been deleted, since that was simply part of the device\'s function. The edge cases could get infuriatingly arcane, especially for girls like them, who had spent centuries wedging their powers into every crack they could open.

They stepped into one of the abandoned rooms, an unpromising box, covered floor to ceiling with the same material as the hallways. Other than that, nothing: no equipment, no furniture, no fixtures.

\"If only every crime scene could have deep space to keep it pristine. It\'s not often I get to look at one nearly untouched like this,\" Rin said, leaning over to peer at a particularly uneven pile of dust.

Next to her, Jeannette hid a smile behind one hand.

\"The drones and troopers touched a bit more than I would wish,\" Rin continued. \"But they know better than to stomp all over everything. Which is a welcome change from the usual Soul Guard squad.\"

Yuma spotted Kana rolling her eyes.

*Nothing much here,* Rin thought, standing back up and clapping her hands. *Looks like it was used primarily for storage, until everything was rushed out. Standard model S‐12 transport crates, and deep space logistics drones from the 2440 generation, judging by the tracks, which gives us at least a lower bound on the date.*

*Nothing much,* Yuma agreed cheekily, allowing Rin to fluff herself up with the understatement.

Rose tapped her foot impatiently against the ground.

They moved on, pausing only briefly to allow Rin to glance over this or that feature of the hallway or an empty room, keeping her thoughts to herself in a way that suggested she had little useful to say. She was a lot more efficient than the classic detective archetype her magic was based on, from a combination of centuries of experience, enhanced senses, and the knowledge that there were more critical things to see---there would be time to come back and dig through the small details, if necessary.

Finally, they arrived at the precipice of one of the more interesting spaces, an unusually long room with a table in the middle, some overturned chairs, and clear damage to the walls, which were made of the kind of higher quality display‐capable material ubiquitous on Earth. The ceilings were also higher, so that Yuma didn\'t have to feel like she was constantly about to run her head into something.

\"I\'m looking forward to *this*,\" Rose said, rubbing her gloved hands together, with the kind of visible excitement some Ancients would kill to feel again.

*If there were Ceph here,* Rin thought, without preamble, *and also Governance Representatives---even if there was a fight, it implies a lot of strange things. For instance, whatever aliens were here, and whatever aliens might be consorting with conspiracies, would clearly be communicating with humans. But there is no other evidence the Cephs have* ever *tried to communicate with us, or even that they can read our languages, even for military advantage. We had thought that they might be deliberately avoiding cultural contamination by refusing to even do the analysis, but this means there\'s at least* some *aliens who have.*

*It could just be the High Command,* Kana thought, as Rin stepped forward to inspect the area. *They certainly wouldn\'t be the first to keep things away from the rank‐and‐file. They might just deny combat troops the ability, for political or ideological reasons.*

*Certainly the combat troops don\'t show much evidence of cognitive independence,* Rose thought.

*You haven\'t seen all the files,* Arisu thought, almost chidingly. *You can\'t really think we\'ve never tried studying their thoughts? We mind‐control them all the time.*

\"Damage primarily from human‐style kinetic weaponry,\" Rin said, standing up abruptly. \"*Very* unusual indications on the floor and table, nothing I recognize, which is odd in and of itself. Signs of a struggle are obvious. It doesn\'t look like whatever fight this was started here---this chair was knocked over by someone falling over while running in from the next room.\"

She walked slowly as she talked, until she stood next to the chair in question. Now she pointed down at the floor dramatically.

\"This floor has been cleaned. The dust lays on this area a lot thinner, which likely resulted from a greater density of cleaning nanites than elsewhere in the room. But the dust is thicker in the middle, where a lot of them were used up cleaning whatever was here. I could drag this on, but there\'s no need to make this more convoluted. Perform a fine‐resolution surface elevation scan with your ocular implants.\"

They did so as directed, walking over and standing still for the slightly uncomfortable process of losing direct control of their vision as their eyes traversed the surface, flashing rapidly through a number of wavelengths.

What they saw, of course, was the shape of a body, superimposed on a shallower shape that was, perhaps, a pool of liquid.

\"A bit oddly shaped for a human,\" Kana said. \"Though obviously, this is a rather inexact method. I don\'t suppose you can do anything with the cleaning nanites here?\"

\"Ah, no, this is not something I can manipulate,\" Yuma said. \"Old, broken‐down cleaning nanites are way too small for my magic. If it\'s outside a body at least.\"

Jeannette reached out, a bright white spark of magic pulsing between her finger and the ground.

\"I thought so. They\'re too broken,\" Jeannette said, with a trace of unsurprised disappointment.

\"Well, let\'s see what the furniture has to say,\" Rose said, reaching for the chair.

A flash of magic pulsed over the chair and table, which shone white three times, reshaping themselves from a bland utilitarian style---one of those minimum‐resource designs that even Governance thought was boring---into antique, dark wood creations from the Spanish colonial period, unless Yuma missed her guess.

Unlike what one might expect, these enchanted objects did not immediately begin moving or talking or raising serious ethical questions about how to treat semi‐sentient furniture. Rose was simply communing, and they knew better than to ask or probe into what it was *she* was seeing---she had always been oddly hostile to the question, and those telepaths that had tried generally refused comment.

*Well!* Rose thought. *Chairs are excitable creatures, not super reliable, but this one saw plenty useful. This is exactly what it looks like. A group of aliens were here on relatively peaceful terms, before a fight broke out somewhere and spilled into this room. One of them died here after being shot numerous times.*

\"Well,\" Yuma said, turning the word into an epithet.

*Given how early in the war this was, it\'s possible this was a clandestine diplomatic effort, especially given the involvement of Governances AIs,* Charlotte thought. *One can only imagine what the aliens thought of us after this. Perhaps the conspiracy\'s involvement here was intended to make diplomacy impossible.*

Again, Yuma saw Rin smile slightly, studying the chair with a thoughtful expression.

*What kind of species conducts diplomacy by side‐channel, while refusing to perform any form of communication by any obvious channel?* Rin asked. As I said, they don\'t show evidence of understanding us anywhere else.*

To Yuma\'s ears the question sounded rhetorical. For someone like Rin, whose wish had been... Holmesian, it implied that she had already followed the chain of reasoning and was leaving a question for the reader, so to speak. Except Yuma couldn\'t shake the feeling that there was more than that, that Rin knew more than she was letting on.

Yuma felt ice grip her heart, but grabbed hold of herself quickly. She had to stay objective; even if a paranoid train of thought like that were correct, it did her no good to show it on her face. She would have to study the issue under better circumstances.

*Who can say?* Rose thought, answering Rin\'s question. *These are aliens. We should not apply our cultural preconceptions to them. Let\'s not spend too long standing here. I want to hear what the next room has to say.*

*Let\'s follow this trail of evidence directly,* Rin thought. *I can try to track this event back to a source. There will be time later to check every room exhaustively.*

There was no objection, so they followed Rin as she stepped gingerly around the area of the chair, towards the threshold at the end of the room where it led back into one of the facility\'s connecting hallways.

At the end of the hallway was an even larger room, large enough to serve as a communal dining area. Here, the walls were faux‐wood paneling, and with some decoration and the right furniture it might even have been described as cozy, if it weren\'t for the fact that the wall was riddled with weapons damage, this time in enough density that it was clear automatic fire had been involved.

It didn\'t require Rin to realize that this room must have been important, and the sheer extent of wall damage suggested it had been a focal point of events. But here the clean‐up job was better done than the previous room---no furniture to interrogate, no telltale traces on the ground. Better done, that is, except for the unrepaired walls.

*They didn\'t have time to do a thorough job, and could only settle for cleaning up the main scene,* Kana thought. *But if that\'s the case, why bother at all?*

Rin bent over to look into one of the holes in the wall.

*Type 7 inert antidrone rounds, but fired subsonic,* she thought. Perhaps a retrofit onto a civilian drone. In any case, this wasn\'t much of a fight---whoever was on the receiving end doesn\'t seem to have fired back.*

She shook her head.

*It was a very messy job, and as Kana said, it makes little sense. If you wanted to conceal what you had done, you either need to destroy the evidence better, or you operate much cleaner. Automatic weapons fire is possibly the* worst *way to do things.*

*Which raises the possibility that someone was* meant *to see this, Yuma said. *But they wanted to leave some uncertainty about that.*

She didn\'t say \"we\" were meant to see this, though the thought had been in her mind for a while now. Even in the age of AIs and Ancients, no one constructed multi‐decade gambits, not for something as unpredictable as this.

Her thoughts were interrupted by Vlasta, who had sent her a mental ping to catch her attention before she reached the room.

Yuma turned around carefully, leaving the others to continue focusing on Rin\'s study of the damage to the room.

\"The forensics team is done with their initial inspection of the main computing cluster,\" Vlasta said. \"They\'ve retrieved the data storage they want for further lab work, but there are a few data crystals that warrant your attention, since they appear to have been smashed without having been deleted.\"

Rin and the others stopped talking for a moment.

\"Well, take me to it then,\" Yuma said. \"Jeannette, you want to join me?\"

Jeannette nodded, striding over after exchanging the briefest of glances with Rin.

They left the rest of the group behind, following Vlasta down a small web of corridors, before reaching a crawlspace freshly‐hewn out of the rock of the asteroid, breaching the seal on a computing cluster that was otherwise only accessible by drone tunnel.

*You have got to be kidding me,* Yuma lamented to herself. She was already feeling claustrophobic, and now she had to do this?

But she swallowed her disquiet and crouched down, getting on hands and knees to move forward by the light of her suit lamp, though she couldn\'t help but reflect that all this would have been much easier if she were just a bit smaller.

She emerged into a pitch‐black alcove just barely large enough for the people there: Vlasta, Yuma, Jeannette, and two others. It too had been hewn out of the rock by the initial drone team, and it was possible to see several other access tunnels.

The members of the forensics team nodded politely, gesturing her towards a tray of data crystals---or rather, what *had been* data crystals, but were now a collection of jewel‐like shards, shot through with metal latticework and iridescent in the lamp light.

\"These are damaged enough that we wouldn\'t be able to recover everything,\" one of them said. \"And that\'s *with* weeks of reconstruction time in the lab. Figure you might give us a bit of a shortcut. We did our best to find all the pieces we could, but we can\'t guarantee anything.\"

Yuma leaned over, letting her suit hold her upright in what would have otherwise been a difficult posture. She took her time inspecting the shards, tilting her head and even picking one up gingerly, feeling its texture through her gloves\' tactile feedback sheath.

She let herself crack a smile.

\"Yeah, that\'ll do. Give me a second.\"

In a way, healing was the purest of magics. Magical girls intrinsically reversed entropy, and healing wounds was almost literally just that, at least in an oddly focused, limited kind of way. Small wonder that light healing was a well‐trodden avenue in power development.

She held her hands out to the tray, allowing her magic to envelope it in a bright green glow, pieces of crystal levitating off the surface to seek their former partners.

Machines were not that much different from biology, indeed simpler, since even the most abstruse of AI‐created designs rarely equaled the messiness of a cell. At first Yuma had only been able to repair mechanical devices she understood, but as Oriko had once taught her, it only took a small change in perspective, a little bit of mental trickery, to think of machines as *injured*. And once she did that, her magic grew a lot more adept at filling in the gaps in her knowledge.

Faster and faster the crystals spun in the air, recalling their original configurations, fusing where they touched.

Compared to repairing a human brain, merely piecing together shards of crystal was child\'s play, an exercise that could have been done in a Governance lab with enough time. The *real* magic was in filling in the pieces that were not there, the atoms missing at the joints, the data lost to the entropy of shattering, the crystal slivers now simply gone, still containing vital data. Somehow, that would all return from the void, much as a healer might restore missing synapses, or missing neurons.

Nearly‐complete crystals now hung before her, still missing a chunk here, a few atoms there, and with one final gesture these sealed shut, gaps filling in with radiant green light.

Then the crystals floated back down, landing on the tray with soft thuds. Inside her suit, small servos moved to place fresh grief cubes near the soul gem on her neck. The process had taken a few minutes, much longer than it took her to heal a human.

\"Well, let\'s take a look,\" Yuma said to the two technicians, who were still mesmerized by the show.

One of them hastened over, raising one arm over the crystals. What looked like a small spigot nozzle emerged from a compartment on the side, tilting over to scan a crystal with a small burst of light.

\"Hmm, still non‐trivial,\" the technician said. \"There is another layer of obfuscation here, distributing information across multiple crystals. Not something you see too much of nowadays---you tend to see either straight‐up quantum cryptography or just not bothering at all.\"

\"Right, but in a situation where you can\'t store keys somewhere off‐site, it\'s not reliable enough security to encrypt static data,\" Jeannette said. \"You still have to store the key *somewhere*, and quantum encryption only guarantees someone can\'t fiddle with it while transmitting without you noticing.\"

\"Yes, with no off‐site storage, they probably didn\'t feel they could put it anywhere safe enough,\" the technician said. \"So they had to do something a bit more traditional.\"

\"How much of an effect will this have on reading the data?\" Yuma asked.

\"It will make it harder, at the very least,\" the technician said, diligently scanning the remaining crystals. \"And even with your, er, contributions, if we don\'t have the pieces necessary to reconstruct some files, then they\'re just lost.\"

Yuma made an annoyed expression, but made sure not to look *too unhappy. This kind of thing was no one\'s fault but the enemy\'s.

\"How long will it take?\" she asked.

\"A couple of hours, less if I take it to a starship computing cluster for processing. However, we can stream the results as they come in.\"

Yuma nodded.

\"Keep me posted,\" she said, turning to leave.

Before she had even managed to bend over to enter the crawlspace, however, she stopped, frowning at a new set of notifications from the cordon ships.

\"What?\" she asked, out loud, long seconds later.

Several human ships had been detected, appearing at the limit of sensor range on inbound FTL trajectories that made it clear they were heading for the asteroid.

For a moment, she had feared the worst---that they had been discovered, that they were about to come under attack, that they might be doomed.

But then, more information had arrived. These weren\'t state‐of‐the‐art military vessels, or unknowns. In fact, Yuma knew these designs well---they were MSY paramilitary, or more precisely, the \"civilian\" designs the MSY used when it wanted to conduct its own operations with teeth, updated versions of the models they had used at New Athens.

And as for what they were doing here...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"What the hell are you doing here?\" Yuma shouted into the connection the instant it was established.

Kyouko couldn\'t help but smile a little at Yuma\'s consternation, projected all over an angry, teenage face she hadn\'t seen in centuries. It brought back warm memories.

She covered her smile with one hand, however. Mirth would have been inappropriate, both because it might make Yuma angrier and... well, the current situation wasn\'t one where she could afford to be careless. Especially after her small flotilla had found it so hard just to establish communications in the first place.

The standard protocol at this range was for starships to exchange a quick series of messages via IIC, establishing who would fly where and who was allowed to approach.

But, lacking a direct IIC wormhole link to each other, that would require routing through a nonlocal IIC node, probably Yenisei---which was a potential dead giveaway about strange activity going on nearby.

There was a backup protocol, usually used by ships with disabled IIC transceivers. It involved patterned FTL sensor pings, and Yuma\'s perimeter ships reacted first, sending a message asking who they were.

Once that was made clear, another message directed Kyouko\'s ships to stop a dozen light‐minutes away, except for a single ship that would fly in and exchange an IIC wormhole pair. A meaningful, but understandable level of paranoia.

Further messages informed them not to be alarmed by gravitational anomalies on‐site---the result of some unexplained site security measure---and for Kyouko to stand by for an open channel once the local IIC connection was established.

In retrospect, she should have expected that she would get an earful.

\"I\'m here tracking a lead,\" Kyouko said. \"Have you checked your equipment? I have.\"

She had to assume Yuma would catch the meaning of that, that they needed to be sure both sides of this local communication had equipment they were sure wasn\'t compromised.

Yuma gave her an appraising look.

\"Yes, of course. I\'m surprised you checked yours. Was it with magic?\"

\"Yes,\" Kyouko said, relaxing. \"Of course. Is there some other way?\"

Yuma seemed to have her attention distracted for a moment, turning to address someone behind her. She appeared to be walking somewhere.

\"We can talk about that later. You were following a lead?\"

Kyouko took a moment to gather her thoughts.

\"Yes. Nadya Antipova was following up on some of Joanne Valentin\'s old travels, which at one point took her to the nearby planet of Yenisei. While there, she heard about a local sighting that sounded very much like Misa Virani. We did not find her, but we did find a mysterious outpost that she had destroyed, invisible to local Governance. From data crystals at the site, we recovered a set of coordinates. And... that\'s pretty much it. I\'m just following up. Didn\'t think it was safe to come out here without a few ships.\"

She could see a look of skepticism in Yuma\'s eyes---she probably thought Kyouko wasn\'t telling the whole truth.

\"Look, I know it sounds pretty coincidental, but that\'s really all there is to it,\" Kyouko said. \"I\'d be happy to share the data files, what little there is, and Nadya\'s here with me, she\'ll vouch for what I say. I take it you\'re here for similar reasons?\"

Yuma stopped walking and crossed her arms, giving Kyouko a laser‐like stare.

After all, what was Yuma doing here? There simply hadn\'t been time for Kyouko to give her any updates on the Cult\'s investigation---not with the person‐to‐person security it took to avoid potential TCF‐related breaches, not given Yuma\'s newfound penchant for travel, spurning her usual haunts on Earth.

Yuma might have come across the same coordinates on her own, but the coincidence involved there was... shocking, to say the least. Kyouko was here, after all, because Misa\'s demolition work---likely assigned by Homura---just happened to spare a couple data crystals.

Did that mean...

She dismissed the thought. Yuma being part of the TCF‐breaching conspiracy, Yuma working for Homura---whether or not these ideas made logical sense, they had been in plenty of crazier situations before, and she had never seen any reason to believe Yuma had anything but the best intentions at heart. Yuma was the one that had warned her about the TCF breach, after all.

That didn\'t mean she wasn\'t up to something, though.

Kyouko\'s ship had informed her that, strangely enough, Yuma\'s transmission was showing minor signal delay, exactly as if standard EM was being used between the asteroid and Yuma\'s perimeter ships. Kyouko couldn\'t imagine why.

Yuma finally gave up her stare.

\"Pretty much,\" she said. \"I was following a lead too. One related to whoever has been breaching Governance security. It occurs to me...\"

She paused rhetorically, letting Kyouko know she wanted her to listen.

\"It occurs to me that I shouldn\'t be so surprised to meet you here. After all, TCF corruption is something that affects us all, and Valentin seemed interested in helping us combat it, regardless of whatever else she was doing. Valentin, or frankly, should we say, Homura?\"

Kyouko blinked, peering at Yuma in her mind\'s eye. Valentin\'s letter had come close to stating the truth outright, but it still felt odd to hear Yuma just *say it*.

She knew, though, what this was about.

\"Yes, Tanaka‐san reported on the letter to me,\" she said. \"It was about Homura, after all, and she thought I was need‐to‐know. Does that bother you?\"

Yuma\'s gaze stayed fixed on her for a long moment, something Yuma had to know was unsettling.

\"Well, yes,\" she said. \"Tanaka‐san knew it was a sensitive matter, and there\'s no official \'share everything with Kyouko\'s Cult\' rule. I don\'t remember agreeing that all my secrets would be shared like this. How am I ever supposed to trust working with one of you again?\"

Yuma\'s wording was abrasive, but she was still talking, and in retrospect, Kyouko could see where she was coming from.

\"I\'m sorry,\" Kyouko said, bowing her head slightly. \"I know how much your secrecy means to you. I just... well, you know, with Homura gone...\"

Kyouko trailed off.

\"We have processes for containing the spread of information,\" she eventually continued, \"and the truly dangerous stuff I\'ve kept to myself. Besides, we never got a chance to sync up. I tried, but you left Earth, and we couldn\'t trust the communication lines, and we\'d been working on this conspiracy stuff together for months already, so...\"

She knew it sounded like excuse‐making, but Yuma still needed to hear it.

\"Besides,\" she said, capping her argument. \"Do you really think we could be behind any of this weird stuff? I thought you knew me better than that.\"

\"Not *that*,\" Yuma said, shaking her head. \"But that doesn\'t mean you\'re not working with someone else. You never told me Mami was paying you visits. What exactly does that magical artifact of yours do to people?\"

Kyouko blinked, then cringed, pursing her lips.

This conversation was too one‐sided. She was the one that had done all the sharing. But... Yuma wasn\'t big on trust. Something that Kyouko understood a bit, at least.

\"I won\'t bullshit you,\" Kyouko said. \"The only answer I can give to you you\'ll dismiss as religious. It connects us to our Goddess, lets Her speak to us, and grants visions, but nothing more, least as far as I can tell. Mami hasn\'t shared what she\'s seen with me, but she saw something. That\'s enough.\"

Nothing she hadn\'t said before, and she half‐expected Yuma to explode at her.

Yuma did looked displeased, but almost rather like she expected it, and surprised Kyouko by continuing the discussion.

\"I\'ve never really pressed you on this, because it\'s a private decision, and honestly, I thought having some meaning in your life, even fake meaning, was worthwhile,\" Yuma said.

She clasped her hands over her mouth, the gesture visible over their internal projections.

\"But I can\'t let that go anymore,\" she said. \"The stakes are too high and there\'s too many people wrapped up in this. How do you know these \'visions\' aren\'t some kind of magical effect? Maybe even someone trying to manipulate you? Remember, it came from Homura. I wouldn\'t put it past her to be able to put together something like that. I hope you\'ve considered the possibility.\"

Kyouko turned the notion over in her head, not so much the idea itself---which occurred to her even at the very beginning---but what it implied about Yuma\'s mindstate.

\"Of course I have,\" she said. \"But even she couldn\'t have put together some of the contents of these visions, and more to the point, we have never been able to find any actual magic on the Ribbon, at least not the kind we can detect. It\'s just... not very likely. If you want, I can send you our records on the matter.\"

Yuma didn\'t look very convinced, but there was nothing else for Kyouko to usefully say. It just wasn\'t that convincing, not unless you had seen a vision yourself, or were naturally inclined towards faith.

\"Look, this is all kinda not the real point,\" Kyouko said, trying to break the conversational impasse. \"This whole thing so far has just been you grilling me about why I\'m here and the Church and Homura and whatever, and I don\'t deserve most of it. I could just as easily ask about how you got here, but I won\'t, because it ain\'t really that important if you don\'t want to share.\"

She made a show of stretching a little, clasping her arms behind her head.

\"So, you want to let us take a look at what you\'ve found? I\'m sure you\'ve already got everybody you need, but another helping hand is always nice. What kind of magic you got with you?\"

She saw Yuma\'s eyes start to narrow, the corners twitching slightly before she got them under control.

\"There\'s no need for anyone else on site,\" Yuma said, shaking her head. \"We have enough security problems as it is.\"

She rubbed her eyes as if she had a headache, and started visibly moving again, perhaps pacing.

\"I hate it, but I\'m going to have to rely on your cult to keep our presence here a secret. Too much rides on it. In return, I\'ll tell you what I find, okay? Just you, though. Tell the rest of your ships to go back.\"

\"No, not just like that,\" Kyouko said, rubbing her own forehead. "Look, I\'ve made enough bad decisions to learn when things need a bit more thinking, and we haven\'t thought about this enough. At least stop and think about this a second.\"

Yuma closed her eyes for what Kyouko worried was an exact, literal second, but when they opened again she could tell the girl had acceded to her logic. The two of them had started interrogating each other almost the instant they came within sensor range, and that just... wasn\'t a good way to make decisions.

\"Now that I think about it, this is really fishy,\" Kyouko said. \"I don\'t know exactly how you were led here, but I\'d bet you scoured some site, recovered these coordinates, and found little else. So either we both got the same tidbit from the big crapsack of secrets these guys don\'t want us to find... or we both got precisely what they *did* want us to find. I know you don\'t believe in coincidences on this scale.\"

\"I don\'t,\" Yuma said, shaking her head. \"But as you say, you don\'t know how I was led here. It wasn\'t in a way that\'s easy to rig. Someone would have had to correctly predict everything we were doing, or track us without being noticed. I don\'t think either is very likely.\"

Yuma seemed to relax bit, eyes softening.

\"Look, I know it feels strange, but I just don\'t see it. Even if this is a set‐up, a set‐up for what, exactly?\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Kyouko admitted, rubbing her cheek. \"An assassination attempt, maybe. Someone already tried against me, once. It\'s been more than once if you count other incidents. And you remember what the Far Seers said, right? Someone has more information about the future than should be possible.\"

*Someone other than us, maybe,* Kyouko thought, but did not say. The Church hoarded its grains of future‐knowledge, carefully gleaned from a too‐miserly Goddess.

\"If it\'s an assassination attempt, that\'s all the more reason for you to head back immediately,\" Yuma said. \"Best not to give a concentrated target.\"

Kyouko blinked once, twice. The logic didn\'t make sense.

\"If you\'re trying to get rid of me, that\'s a pretty stupid way to do it,\" she said, letting real annoyance seep into her voice. \"If that\'s really what\'s going on, we should all be leaving. Leave the lower‐level personnel here to investigate. Kind of a shitty move, but wouldn\'t be the first time we\'ve let others take the risk for us. Not even close.\"

\"What\'s going on here is too important, too sensitive to just be left behind,\" Yuma said. \"And I brought investigation specialists. It will only take a little while longer to finish.\"

\"Well, then I\'m not leaving,\" Kyouko said. \"We\'re already here, and I brought way more firepower than you did.\"

She made sure to look directly into Yuma\'s virtual eyes, a contest of wills carried out remotely.

\"Suit yourself,\" Yuma said. \"We\'ll meet up after I\'m done.\"

Yuma cut the connection, leaving Kyouko to sit there, for a moment alone in an empty room with her thoughts.

\"You finished in there?\" Maki asked, from somewhere outside.

\"Yeah,\" she said, leaning back in her chair.

The door slid open, and Maki stepped through, shaking her head ruefully.

\"When you asked me to come with you, you said there would be some things you had to keep secret,\" Maki said, crossing her arms. \"And I accepted that, since you said there wouldn\'t be that much.\"

\"Yeah, look,\" Kyouko said, kneading her forehead. \"Everyone already knows that Yuma is already there, and she won\'t budge on letting us get any closer. Yet. She promises she\'ll share what she finds. That\'s honestly the main details, but there\'s a lot of stuff on the side that it isn\'t safe to spread around. Even to you. Sorry. It\'s business.\"

\"Hmm, seems like a lot of sneaking around for \'business\',\" Maki said, putting a hand on her shoulder. It was a gesture of familiar intimacy, of a kind that Kyouko wasn\'t really used to.

Kyouko gave a half‐hearted shrug with the other shoulder.

\"These are strange times,\" she said. \"You know about the people who tried to kill me. You know why the Church is here. We can\'t be too careful.\"

She paused, weighing whether to say what she was thinking.

She hadn\'t wanted to bring Maki, of course. The reason was the same as it always was---it wasn\'t safe. As an Ancient, Kyouko could handle herself. She expected the same of other Ancients, mere competency from centenarians, and much, much less of anyone younger than that. This meant that, in a risky scenario, Maki wasn\'t just likely to be useless, she was also likely to get herself in trouble and weigh everyone down.

That was her instinctive reaction, at least. On further consideration, the matter wasn\'t as simple as that. Like most of her generation, Maki had serious military training, simulation time included, something that much of Kyouko\'s generation had opted out of. Kyouko herself had only participated in a \"skinny\" version, focusing on the aspects of command she was most likely to ever be involved in.

Beyond that, if she was honest, there was a certain... reluctance she had to involving Maki in this aspect of her life. It felt like breaching the wall between two parts of her she had always kept separate, between the kooky, profligate persona that she used to destress, and the version of her that had to grudgingly admit that, yes, she was an Ancient, and old as the hills.

She didn\'t like what that meant.

She had to say something, though. These kinds of things had a way of being said eventually anyway, so you were better off keeping control of the matter.

\"I\'m not sure I should have brought you,\" she said, finally, sighing. "I think that\'s fair for me to say? You can see the danger here.\"

Maki nodded once, slowly.

\"Yes, it\'s dangerous, but that doesn\'t mean I shouldn\'t be here. It\'s not like I don\'t have combat experience. I have this new body to thank the labs for, remember?\"

\"Don\'t remind me,\" Kyouko said, nervously rubbing her human‐original hair.

\"Right, so, if you can be mad at me for putting myself in danger, I can do the same. You knew there might be a trap out here. You came anyway. Why?\"

Maki crossed her arms, with the frowning gesture of a mother berating a child.

\"I had to oversee things,\" Kyouko said, flattening her lips.

\"Bullshit. You have plenty of people to oversee things for you---just like you did for X‐25. Mami‐san is the only one of you Ancients with enough sense to delegate.\"

Kyouko started to point out how ridiculous the criticism was, but bit it down, knowing that it was at least *mostly* founded.

\"Fine,\" she said. \"I don\'t like it, but fine.\"

\"You want to stay with me, you\'re not going to like everything,\" Maki said, leaning into her.

They stayed there, briefly, Maki\'s hair coiling into hers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside the asteroid, Yuma was holding a hasty conference with her confidants.

The technician had found something on the healed data crystals, and had insisted Yuma view it immediately, even in incomplete form.

After downloading the small video, a very short, truncated clip of surveillance footage, she had understood what had gotten the technician so riled up, and assembled her magical girl team at the site where events had taken place, conveniently one of the rooms they had already visited.

They stood silently, arms crossed, their implants creating a shared holographic vision of events long gone.

The table was arranged for what was clearly a formal yet somber event, draped with a dark blue cloth and decorated with two pitchers of water. On it, a spherical device balanced precariously, its geometry of obvious alien design.

At that table sat three humans, the avatars of Governance AIs, one of them MG, and two Cephalopods, wearing colorful, cloth‐like material and strange metal adornments, which marked them as distinct from any other alien Yuma had ever seen. The garments most resembled tunics, except with more intricate folds and with obvious allowances for alien physiology.

\"We are here because we think we have been betrayed,\" the device said, in Human Standard. \"There was supposed to be a message delivered, before the war, but we do not think it ever was. There is, we suspect, a third party involved. We wanted to verify---\"

And there the video ended, only a fragment of a file after all. The simulated bodies of its subjects stayed frozen in place, and for a long moment, so did the magical girls surrounding them, digesting the information presented.

\"I told him to get back to Raven,\" Yuma said, \"and to use whatever resources he needed to try to read the rest of the data crystals. I\'ve already risked a transmission back to Nova Terra with the video and a sum---\"

Whatever she would have said next was lost then, as Kana tilted her head upwards, mouth opening as her arms snapped outward, grabbing Rin and Arisu by their arms. Time skidded nearly to a halt as Yuma\'s combat reflexes came online, but even as she transformed, the three of them disappeared from sight.

Her mind hastened to parse the situation, leaning on both her magical girl abilities and Governance implants. Kana, like many of her age and type, had filled out the telecluster at some point and was a capable teleporter, but what was she doing? What could possibly---

The world around her jerked as a telekinetic force sent her flying into the air. She stopped herself with magic, hanging suspended ever so briefly, before a still‐untransformed Jeannette smashed into her.

*She\'s wasting time worrying about Rin,* some part of her reasoned, combat hyperspeed used for an almost mundane thought.

*Charlotte, get them back to the ship!* Kana thought with the same acceleration.

Yuma processed instantly that Charlotte had been grouping them for a teleport, reached out to Rose‐Merline\'s outstretched, oncoming hand, and then they reappeared on the *HSS Raven* that same instant, only fractions of a second since Kana had vanished. Only then did Kyouko\'s messages begin to arrive, leaden with transmission‐delay and loaded with diagrams of two Raptor missiles on inbound trajectories, ones which should have already concluded.

Kana and the others must have handled the missiles, she realized. There was no way they could have ever survived even a glancing hit or nearby detonation.

Raven, already taking off, informed her that Arisu had teleported both missiles beyond the asteroid, engines telekinetically crippled, aided by Kana\'s clairvoyance and Rin\'s magic‐grade computations.

Yuma dropped into a command chair, establishing a connection before most of her interface ports had even aligned.

For a moment, she saw the world with her fleet\'s eyes, picket ships shearing apart under a wave of attacks from an unseen assailant, until whatever sensors she was using vanished too.

Squid, she thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko turned her head, adjusting a mental dial that controlled perceived helmet transparency. As she looked over the rest of her MagOps squad, their faces faded slightly, blending into the absurd color and pomp of transformed armor.

They sat in the hold of their ship, in seats laid out in rows along the two walls, which were tuned to a soothing blue to conserve power. The half‐dozen or so veterans were silent, expressions stoically bored. The odd one out was Amane, one of their barrier generators, who seemed to be sharing a private joke with the girl next to her, the both of them smiling.

Simona, on the other hand, looked jittery, clasping and unclasping her hands.

The ship shook, throwing them briefly against their harnesses and sending their bones rattling with a cracking noise that seemed to echo in their skulls. Simona held onto her harness with both hands, eyes closed.

Something had glanced against their shielding, but there was no serious damage.

Ryouko sighed, rubbing her hands to relieve some of the tension.

No plan in war survived contact with the enemy. So it proved, when the pioneer ships had immediately run into a thin shell of small, carefully‐spaced transition metal asteroids.

In human terms, they were puny---individual rocks at most a few centimeters in diameter, spaced an average of a tenth of a kilometer apart.

In astronomical terms, that was unnaturally dense, and the speed of the orbit meant that an inopportune collision---for instance, into a rock traveling in an anti‐parallel orbit---involved the energy equivalent of a moderate‐size nuclear weapon. Hazardous for navigation by magical girl and frigate alike, and not safe to pilot human cruisers into.

It had been expected that the pulsar would have long ago cleared its inner orbits, or if it hadn\'t, that the aliens certainly would have---a cloud of relativistic debris was no one\'s idea of safety. Long‐range gravimetrics had seemingly borne that out. But while Asami\'s data had proven remarkably accurate on the whole, it hadn\'t been precise enough to detect the debris\' scant total mass.

Fortunately, someone in the bevy of planning AIs had thought of this possibility, that the aliens would introduce an asymmetric environmental hazard---for example, by sacrificing their space‐time cargo cruisers as suicide missiles. With home field advantage and better shielding, such a tactic would give the aliens a temporary leg up.

The fleet had thus been able to adjust its approach immediately, its cruisers pulling back to give priority to an assortment of specialized defense frigates and drones that would clear out orbits. There could be no delay, no time wasted regrouping.

For a moment, Ryouko had even thought they had the problem handled.

Then the aliens deployed their second defensive measure.

*\"I have to hand it to them, they are extremely creative,\"* Simona transmitted, eschewing her suit\'s speaker system, perhaps because she didn\'t trust herself to speak.

Ryouko didn\'t respond right away, clinging onto her straps as their frigate, the *HSS María Orosa,* lurched sideways.

Rather than defend the pulsar\'s inner orbit conventionally, the aliens had somehow turned the gravity modulators themselves into weapons, emitting massive pulses that sent everything in orbit---ships, debris, alien attack drones---into chaotic, spiraling trajectories, making it a struggle just to avoid getting too close to the star or hurled into a hyperbolic orbit. Magical girls that had been caught outside their ships had been flung away---some had not made it back, and their fates weighed on the mood of the fleet.

It also meant that Ryouko had to wait here, effectively useless, as her ship lurched this way and that to control their trajectory among a hailstorm of debris and gravitational distortions. They couldn\'t even watch---the ship was far too busy to feed them real‐time updates, updates they couldn\'t even understand without extensive cognitive offloading to their TacComps and suits.

*\"We\'re losing time,\"* Simona added. *\"This is supposed to be a lightning operation, and we\'re just bleeding sitting here. We give them time to get external reinforcements and we\'re* toast. *We might not even be able to leave.\"*

That last comment referred to the effect the gravitational anomalies might have on opening the wormhole to go *back*. If they needed to destroy the modulators just to open the wormhole again, then that meant the mission was win or die, a notion that cast all they were doing in sharp relief.

\"The fleet knows that,\" Ryouko said, simply. She knew where Simona was coming from, the nervousness of being in your first, *real* combat operation, surrounded by veterans who seemed preternaturally cool.

Their MagOps team was the only one still on standby. It was mission‐critical that the two of them stay together with Asami, who was needed on the bridge, wired into the Command Gestalt so she could relay what she saw with her magic.

The rest of the fleet had begun operations, despite the conditions. Ships began attack runs, teams with teleporter support began to insert, names Ryouko knew: Azrael, Mina, Annabelle...

But they waited, even as the casualty numbers slowly climbed. The veterans took it in stride, but it wore on Simona and, honestly, Ryouko too.

\"The waiting takes some getting used to,\" one of their squadmates said, as if following the train of thought. \"But the fleet knows better than any of us, and so we have to just trust them.\"

The girl shrugged, then gestured with her helmet at the girl beside her.

\"I can\'t even say I disagree with the fleet about staying here. We were assigned to you VIPs for a reason.\"

That was Zheng Ying‐zhi, an alumnus of the wormhole stabilizer mission, and one of the few familiar faces on Ryouko\'s team. Reputation and experience meant that she was the squad leader, the chains of command clear despite their hodgepodge of nearly homogeneous ranks and physical ages, all around eighteen.

\"That being said, I do believe they\'re about to free us to deploy.\"

\"About time,\" Amane said. \"I\'m tired of sitting here watching these two lose their minds. Getting outside will be good for them.\"

\"They\'re not your *kids*, Amane.\"

\"Are you sure? Don\'t be misled just because they look like adults.\"

Simona chuckled nervously, and Ryouko shook her head in feigned dismissal, closing her eyes to check her fleet uplink.

She took in the full cost‐benefit report from the fleet, the information surging into her local implant memory faster than her synapses could have normally managed. She appreciated, briefly, the extra processing Clarisse now had access to, even if it came at the cost of the body she was used to.

The alien\'s tactics had delayed them substantially, and only five of the twenty‐four gravity modulators had been crippled so far. At the current rate, they would not finish before alien reinforcements arrived, and would face a nightmare: sacrificing much of the fleet for a long shot pulsar glitch or, lacking a wormhole, simply dying, without hope for even a suicidal victory.

As such, the fleet needed every last insertion team in action, and they were the best---a strike force with humanity\'s premier gravity mage and teleporter could do a lot of work. Everyone else would just have to do without Asami\'s command chair input, and traverse the gravitational chaos on their own.

Ryouko was standing up before she had even finished digesting the report, her squadmates doing likewise, grouping around her.

Asami appeared moments later, visibly unhappy, the sour expression strange on a more adult face. Ryouko had *almost* gotten used to how much older she looked now, but it still felt weird.

\"It\'s happening, we\'re cleared to engage,\" Asami said, stepping into place for the teleport.

She took a deep breath.

\"Alright then, let\'s... go and get ourselves killed, I suppose.\"

Amane grabbed her by the shoulder, the slap of gauntlet on suit making an audible thunk.

\"What you mean is, let\'s go and save the human race,\" she said, making it sound almost like a rebuke, before softening her tone:

\"You\'ll be fine out there,\" she said.

Asami smiled faintly.

\"Thanks, Amane.\"

\"We have a job to do today,\" Ying‐zhi said, reaching out to tap her fist against the shoulder pads of the newer magical girls. \"In our souls we know that we\'re going to do it right and do it well. That\'s all there really is to it. We *are* ready for this.\"

It was a speech in miniature, sappy without magical glamour to support it, but it did some of its job, lifting spirits by the sheer fact that someone was willing to *say* it, and even seemed to believe it.

It reminded her of something Clarisse van Rossum had done once, even if it felt like a lifetime ago. Had she grown since then?

Asami managed a slight smile, and Simona looked less shaky, so Ryouko decided it was a good time to close her eyes and concentrate on the ensuing teleport. She controlled the unofficial countdown, synchronized over their combat interface.

She took a breath, accepting a set of coordinates from the ship AI, catching the briefest of glimpses of where they would land. It was deep within the bowels of an alien station, near the center of a small, habitable pocket of rooms.

What happened next was fast even by their standards.

As she arrived, kneeling to recharge her soul gem, her teammates laced the perimeter with a killing density of magic, fire and shield wall coupling with a distorting blast that locked the world around them briefly in place. This was no stealth insertion.

Then it became apparent that the effort had been mainly overkill, and there had been no meaningful defenses lying in wait. Instead, the corpses of alien personnel lay where they fell, only a few in armor. It seemed even the aliens couldn\'t saturation garrison everything, especially not when it came to numerous kilometer‐size installations far in the rear.

It felt... anticlimactic, somehow.

Ryouko frowned as she stood back up. Asami and Simona moved immediately to the side of the room that connected with the gravity modulator, while the others fanned out to guard the entrances and clear the hallways. At the wormhole stabilizer there had been nuclear devices embedded in the base itself, ready to sterilize any surprise insertions---no one around the pulsar had yet encountered anything so potent.

Ryouko looked around at the bodies around her, the rounded alien architecture, the odd clothing some of them wore. It wasn\'t quite like the simulations---she had been presented with no chance to kill anything herself, and lacking that bloodlust she felt only a strange pity.

She watched Asami set to work, summoning a black hole and sending it directly into the wall, through which it tore an efficient fist‐sized hole. The simulations had frequently included a beautiful transparent viewing panel, and Ryouko found herself sad that she wouldn\'t get a chance to see the modulator directly---reportedly, it looked less like an FTL core, and more like an elegant orrery.

Ryouko knelt down again, inspecting one of the alien bodies at her feet.

How ordinary it looked! It was strange to say about what was, after all, an alien race with four arms---or rather, tentacles. But the creature lay prostrate on the ground, and while the skin was a rubbery gray‐green, the eyes had pupils, and it had died grasping the leg of a chair with, basically, hands. Ichor, smelling mostly of copper, painted the scene in the color of her soul gem.

In truth, that was all familiar. What was less familiar was the robe‐like garment it wore, covered in blue and green curlicues with a brown border, a design wholly unlike the utilitarian designs she was used to.

Looking down at it all, it was hard to be intimidated. She found herself lifting one of the arms. To a magical girl, or even to a human soldier, it was like lifting a small furniture cubelet.

Briefly, she imagined throwing the body into the wall. Perhaps that would get her into more of the combat mood.

Then she spotted Simona looking at her, and stood back up.

\"Something seem wrong?\" Simona asked, with a trace of nervousness.

\"No, I\'m just musing, I guess,\" Ryouko responded.

She felt a strange guilt, knowing that it wasn\'t really an answer, and that Simona was uneasy. In her shoes, she would have wanted some more details.

\"It\'s just, I find it difficult at times like these not to think how similar they are to us. They\'re not like Incubators, they clearly have technicians and all that. And yet...\"

*And yet they came to kill us,* Amane thought, eavesdropping on their conversation from across the room. *I\'ve wondered these things too, but in the end it doesn\'t matter. Even if the squid* did *deign to talk to us, what would it change?*

\"It\'s a shame,\" Asami said, oblivious to the conversation behind her. "Imagine what we could learn if we could just take one of these home.\"

She was referring to the gravity modulator, of course. By now they were used to these kinds of comments, so they said nothing, Simona with her hand on Asami\'s suit to add power, Ryouko standing by for the extraction.

To Ryouko, Asami seemed even more detached than usual, eerily focused on her task---her way of coping, perhaps, with the tension of the situation.

She felt a wave of nausea, and glimpsed the world around her stretching* slightly, or maybe it was her own eyes. It passed before her implants even needed to recalibrate.

*Gravity distortion,* Clarisse thought, even though she had already been fed that information subconsciously. *Clocks went wild for a second too, we were at ninety percent reference clock speed for about four hundred milliseconds, local.*

*That\'s normal,* Ryouko thought, comparing against the telemetry from some of the other teams.

\"I\'m done,\" Asami said.

\"Then let\'s get out of here,\" Simona said, somewhat unnecessarily, as the rest of their group gathered around Ryouko.

Ryouko couldn\'t help share the sentiment. Something about this place unnerved her.

They returned to their ship then, after as clean an engagement as they could have possibly hoped for.

But unlike even some of the more pessimistic scenarios envisioned in the simulations, they weren\'t able to operate outside the ship, which made insertion a slower, more delicate task. As envisioned, they would have had the luxury of spending *some* time spaceborne, using randomized sequential teleports to make their approach and target much less predictable. Instead, that had to be done purely through ship maneuvers, which took longer to achieve the same effect.

For better or worse, that gave her more time to think, as the group cleansed their soul gems and reviewed the state of the operation as a whole. Fortunately, the loss of six more modulators---to make eleven so far, just under half the total---meant the aliens\' gravity hurling effects were weaker, and they didn\'t need to strap in just to avoid slamming into bulkheads.

After all the simulations, after an extremely tumultuous insertion, that modest turn in their favor felt surreal, even if, in some sense, they had *needed* that breakthrough in the battle. They had needed it to be the case that further gravity modulators could be picked off in more‐or‐less rapid succession, without punishing losses. Now, they simply needed to maintain their new pace.

Did that mean they had things under control, or that they were desperate?

\"You\'re looking melancholy,\" Amane said, appearing next to her.

She looked up. Amane had her helmet off, smiling as she lifted what had once been a Breaker laser cannon, magically transfigured into an assemblage of brass and moving gears that... still did pretty much the same thing, just with magical girl fire rate and specs. As she watched, it vented a bit of steam.

It looked picturesque, she thought. Almost as if it were out of a movie. Helmet off, winning smile, the backdrop of the ship\'s armory to fill in the negative space, racks and racks of conventional infantry weapons, should they choose to bring any.

Except...

\"Shouldn\'t you have your helmet on?\" Ryouko asked. \"I might need to do an emergency teleport at any time.\"

Amane shrugged, the embellished smile fading.

\"If that were really a concern, we would be standing together, not scattered about the ship. Besides, don\'t you trust a barrier generator to be ready for this sort of thing?\"

She made a flexing motion with one arm, as if it was even possible to see anything under the layers of armor. Ryouko made sure to roll her eyes slightly.

\"Really though, I\'d like to know what you\'re thinking about,\" Amane said, leaning over. \"You seem off.\"

Ryouko thought about it, feeling a trace of annoyance.

\"I guess I\'m just a bit overwhelmed. Am I supposed to look happy or something? Why don\'t you ask Simona or Asami? They look more nervous than I do.\"

The girl\'s smile faded entirely. With a flash of magic, her weapon shrunk in size enough that she could sling it on her back.

\"Yeah, I guess I\'m overstepping a little, but *their* reactions I understand. You, you\'re just sitting here. That\'s a new one for me.\"

Ryouko couldn\'t give the whole truth, about the visions or the foreboding, or the thoughts she had to entertain about possibly being protected*, even while the others weren\'t. She couldn\'t *quite* feel the same as them.

\"Despite my reputation,\" she said, the words sounding strange even as she said them, \"I have not been in that much combat. Not really, only a few missions. I don\'t know what to do with myself. I know it\'s not supposed to be a great time or anything, it\'s just... tense.\"

\"I\'ve read your files,\" Amane said. \"And I know you know that. If that\'s all it were I wouldn\'t be saying anything.\"

She seemed to mull over what to say, then put her helmet back on, the interlocks closing silently.

\"I\'m not as good at reading people as one of the older folks,\" Amane said, through her speakers this time, \"but if I had to guess, you feel like we expect you to be a hero, after what happened at Orpheus. Trust me, you don\'t have to live up to that. All we see is a kid on one of her first missions. You don\'t have to prove anything---just stick with us, and we\'ll see you through this. That\'s all we expect. Let me and Yingling take the pressure.\"

Ryouko nodded, as if she agreed with the sentiment, feeling like a liar. There was no way she could really explain.

\"Call me that again and I\'ll throw you into the star myself,\" Ying‐zhi said, marking her entrance with a pantomimed punch into Amane\'s gut. \"Who told you about that nickname?\"

\"I have my sources,\" Amane said. She put both hands over her stomach in mock agony, winking at Ryouko.

\"How about this?\" Ying‐zhi asked. \"No more nicknames for the rest of the mission, and I\'ll bail you out of this conversation. Give Ryouko some real advice.\"

\"Sounds like a lose‐lose to me,\" Amane said. But she left the armory nonetheless, giving Ryouko a wave goodbye and taking a pistol off the far rack.

Ying‐zhi turned to look at Ryouko, and Ryouko wondered if there was a non‐awkward way to ask her not to take off her helmet, or if it was safer just not to bring it up at all.

\"I heard what she said,\" Ying‐zhi said. \"She\'s not wrong, but I was with you on that mission. I know there\'s another side to you. I\'m sure you\'ll find it.\"

She gave Ryouko a reassuring shoulder pat, and this time Ryouko shrugged vaguely, again concealing her true reaction.

*A different side?* Ryouko thought. *I mainly just remember going berserk when a teammate died.*

*I don\'t have to tell you you\'re letting it get to you too much, Clarisse thought. *You shouldn\'t brood like this.*

Clarisse\'s tone was neutral, but Ryouko heard the rebuke anyway. Perhaps a bit of worry, too, not quite tucked away. It was harder to tell with Clarisse out of the hologram form that had become so familiar on Adept Blue.

\"I\'ll do what I need to do,\" Ryouko said, standing up. The decisiveness was even mostly authentic.

\"That\'s my girl,\" Ying‐zhi said, smiling and raising her hand, on top of which appeared... what seemed to be a cartoonish hologram of Ryouko herself, giving a thumbs‐up sign.

\"I found this on the net,\" she said. \"You have fans out there. Don\'t take too long. We\'ll need you soon.\"

*They seem to have totally different ideas of what you need,* Clarisse thought, as Ying‐zhi restocked and left the armory as well. *I suppose that\'s fair, since you don\'t really know either. You may as well head out; it\'s nearly time.*

As she stepped out of the room, she nearly collided with Simona, who jumped backward in surprise.

\"Sorry,\" she said, as they instinctively tried to make eye contact, and then immediately broke it.

Ryouko turned to join the others, and Simona followed.

*It\'s not easy, being out here,* Simona thought. *I thought I knew what it was like to be in dangerous situations, but the waiting, the tension, is something else. I... envy you your place in things. Me, all I can do is pick a single green light to guide me.*

Ryouko blinked, glad Simona couldn\'t see her expression. The subtext was, well, obvious, and it took her a moment to notice what Simona had said about envy.

\"I\'ll try to live up to those expectations,\" she said. \"Most of them, at least.\"

Yet again, she couldn\'t admit the truth. She had some idea of what her place was in the world. It just hadn\'t made things much better.

That was a scary thought.

It was with relief that she remembered that the mission timer in her subconscious was running out. The jump window was brief; it was time to go.

They stepped into the rec area, where the other girls had gathered.

\"We all ready?\" Ying‐zhi asked simply.

When there was no objection, she raised a hand, and they grasped each other\'s arms, forming the necessary chain of contact for Ryouko\'s teleport.

Then they were there, and like the previous run, it was a slaughter, even if this time the aliens seemed better prepared, with more soldiers, fewer civilian personnel, and a better drone complement near the modulator.

When the bedazzling display of color was over, their barrier generators dropped their shields for a moment.

\"Ugh,\" Ying‐zhi vocalized, restoring her barrier almost instantaneously as a flash of pain rippled through them, internal radiation alarms blaring. Amane added her own, only a fraction of a second later, a wall of steam settling into place.

Blasting an area with radiation was by this point in the war a classic anti‐magical girl tactic, effective at penalizing magical girl teams who lacked appropriate defenses. It was so classic that they had come totally prepared for it.

Ying‐zhi\'s golden barrier shimmered and flashed as it absorbed the invisible punishment, then an accompanying blast of deliberate gravitational stress, also anticipated. Some barrier generators were not capable of sealing out something like *gravity*, but Ryouko\'s protectors were, and Asami was able to donate some protection as well, even if it didn\'t come in the form of a visible wall.

Outside the barrier, corpses and equipment flung around the room with violent speed, powered by the gravity modulator itself, and some slammed physically into Amane\'s barrier, disintegrating on contact.

\"Damn, they\'re getting better at this,\" someone said.

\"They\'d be stupid not to, or I\'d think it\'s getting too easy,\" Amane said. \"Come on, let\'s do this.\"

The radiation subsided soon after---not the easiest thing to generate persistently---but the gravitational oscillations persisted, forcing them to move towards the side of the room facing the modulator with barriers up. There was at least one benefit: the usual onslaught of alien infantry and drones could not proceed, so in a way all they needed to do was keep their barrier generators fed with grief cubes.

The immediate danger had passed and now, against her better judgment, Ryouko couldn\'t stop thinking about Simona\'s situation, and hers. Perhaps it was time to ask.

*So I wanted to ask,* Ryouko thought, directly to Simona.

*What?*

*What do you think of the Goddess?*

There was a palpable silence, partially explained by Simona focusing on helping Asami with her task.

*Nothing much, really. I certainly haven\'t seen her in my life. But I\'ve followed you enough to know that you seem to think you have. It must be nice.*

The tone of the thought was unexpectedly bitter, and Simona seemed to realize that, adding:

*Look, like I said, I envy you. And admire you, of course. It only stands to reason a Goddess would pay attention to you, and not to me. That\'s probably why you\'re not very nervous.*

Again, the tone was biting, but Ryouko found that she couldn\'t begrudge it.

*From her perspective, having a sublime and merciful goddess controlling your life must seem like quite a step up from having a shadowy conspiracy doing the same,* Clarisse thought. *No visible strings.*

Almost *no visible strings,* Ryouko corrected.

*Wait, but do you think she\'s real?* Ryouko asked, addressing the hole in Simona\'s statement.

Again, Simona waited to respond, but before she did, a streak of concern from Asami cut her off.

Ryouko sent Asami an inquisitive ping.

*Something wrong? They have extra defenses somehow?* Ryouko asked, though she struggled to imagine what kind of non‐magical defense could stop a mobile black hole.

*No,* Asami thought. *I\'m feeling something... strange. Something is wrong. Not with us. With the operation. I need to focus. Just give me a moment to finish this.*

Her sharp sense of worry pervaded the team\'s shared telepathic connection. As one, they turned to their connections to Command, checking for updates.

The notification came through before they could even ask.

*There is a tremendous amount of gravitational flux near the southerly magnetic pole of the pulsar,* Clarisse thought, having parsed the material first. *From what we\'ve concluded is their actual mining infrastructure. It is difficult to say what this means, since the fleet has been unable to build a solid model for space‐time mining, despite the hardened probes returning good data.*

She didn\'t say it, but there was other bad news. A large alien response force had blinked in just outside the system, and elements of it would be back online soon. This they had known would happen, but that didn\'t make it any better.

*There were a few scenarios we ran back during the simulations, where the mines dumped their stores of space‐time, or blew themselves up, or triggered a pulsar glitch,* one of the other team members commented.

*A lot of possibilities,* Clarisse agreed. *Whatever it is, it can\'t be good, and what are we even supposed to do? Send teams to attack it? Run?*

*Well, they better make a decision quickly,* Amane thought. *We definitely can\'t just* wait.

This time, when Asami breached the inner containment, they had barriers up, so the ensuing space‐time ripple passed by them harmlessly.

The space station shuddered, as expected. But then the tremors didn\'t stop.

*We need to get back to the ship,* Asami thought, with a tinge of desperation. *Something big is going on. It feels like the aliens are tearing *into the space near the pulsar. I don\'t know why. We need to get back. Please cover me.*

Without explanation, Asami blinked a few times, then gained the glassy‐eyed look of someone immersing themselves more deeply into the fleet gestalt, but who didn\'t want to close their eyes.

*Ryouko?* Ying‐zhi asked.

*Working on it,* she thought.

Asami blinked rapidly, her expression darkening with worry as she seemed to wake up again.

*Something* else *is wrong,* she thought, with combat speed. *And it\'s close to us.*

A sickening feeling gathered in Ryouko\'s stomach, as the congregated magical girls looked at her in confusion as nothing happened.

*I can\'t teleport,* she thought, her soul gem shimmering. *I\'m being blocked. I don\'t know how that\'s possible.*

*Are you sure?* Ying‐zhi asked, telepathy like a razor. *What if you---*

*I\'m sure. Magic instinct.*

Asami closed her eyes for a long few seconds, searching for something.

*I know what they\'re doing with the mines,* she thought. *They\'re ripping our wormhole back open---it\'ll be torn apart if I don\'t get back.*

## The Dying Light, Part One 

> Like the naval destroyers of old, starships of the nebulous \"standard frigate\" type are the least glamorous fellows in the fleet. Unlike their stealth frigate cousins, they rarely make individual headlines or attract the attention of celebrity rumor mills---but as a whole they take pride in their versatility, in their unshakeable élan, and in their sheer numbers. Across every far‐flung outpost and shipping lane of the Human diaspora, and through every nerve and sinew of the Navy, standard frigates have made themselves at home, confident, and thoroughly indispensable.
>
> Part of the secret behind the standard frigate\'s versatility is that, like all generalist terms, \"standard frigate\" is a misnomer, a historical, colloquial term that elides the diversity of an incredibly broad class of people. There is no single frigate who can do all the jobs which frigate‐type starships are asked to do. Often, the categorization reveals little more than the ship\'s approximate tonnage, with the term \"standard\" indicating a lack of special stealth or magical girl association.
>
> A frigate\'s formal class is thus much more useful in establishing their role, ranging from the sublight orbital‐bound Defenders, to the patrol and escort Exquisites, to the anti‐fighter/bomber Valiants, current mainstay of the Fleet. A standard frigate might protect a planetary surface from bombardment, guard a civilian or military convoy against a Cephalopod raid, screen a deep‐space installation, or brave a withering storm of alien fighters, bombers, drones, and missiles amid large‐scale fleet operations.
>
> Each class of standard frigate represents a unique design intended to fulfill a specific mission suite. Classes are then further subdivided into variations specialized for certain subtasks or local celestial environments. Missions run the gamut, including shipyard defense, carrier bomber screening, intrasystem surveillance and reconnaissance, orbital fire support, landing craft escort, suppression of enemy space defenses (SESD), \"drone swatting\", mine clearing, and so on.
>
> \[...\]
>
> From a logistical and economic point of view, these frigates range widely along the tradeoff between flexibility in service and expense of production. Valiant‐class frigates are expected to be among the fastest ships produced, accompany the deep‐space fleet on operations, and serve passably in almost every space‐based environment. As such, they are produced at great expense primarily in Core World shipyards, at the end of long supply chains in metamaterials, nanites, and precision electronics.
>
> At the other end of the scale, Defender‐class frigates solely focus on planetary orbit, and could nearly be classified as unusually‐mobile orbital platforms, if they\'ll forgive my saying so. They could be manufactured en masse from an orbital foundry using little more than some asteroid matter---though, when possible, extensive customization is added for local planetary conditions.
>
> \[...\]
>
> Pitched deep‐space combat is thus dominated by the difficulty of targeting. The lack of independently‐FTL weapons on both sides---aside from the dreaded, but quite costly Cephalopod Raptor missile---means that tracking and hitting a target moving at relativistic speed is often impossible. Effective attacks therefore rely either on saturation*, extensive use of guided missiles, or, most riskily, matching velocities with a target. Short‐range FTL use is possible but rare, impeded by the difficulty of establishing an FTL bubble and ramping up to speed in a crowded, contested, oft‐interdicted environment.
>
> Velocity‐matching is the hardest scenario to discuss, so we dispense with it first. To start, it must be said that this sharing of trajectories is usually at the relativistic scale only, and two ships with \"matched velocities\" can readily engage in elaborate maneuvers involving, in absolute terms, considerable differences in speed, distance, and direction---enormous differences in any other environment.
>
> Next, it goes almost without saying that matching velocities with an enemy to achieve better targeting also gives that enemy *better targeting on you*, and so such fights between even opponents tend to be short, violent affairs, with enemies sometimes helping achieve the velocity match, effectively consenting to the \"knifefight\". Combat here is dominated by the use of short‐range but hard‐to‐dodge lasers.
>
> This is between even opponents. In practice, knifefights are principally used to an attacker\'s advantage, typically against a victim too damaged to escape or fight back effectively, or when one side has a sharp local advantage in numbers. Cephalopod dominance in the field of laser weaponry, particularly in the superior range of the Sarissa* laser system, ensures that Human frigates grant their opponents a healthy degree of respect.
>
> Leaving aside these close encounters, guided missiles, then, provide the bulk of the effective frigate‐to‐frigate firepower on both sides, ameliorated by extensive anti‐missile capabilities, again on both sides. Fired from advantageous trajectories with a substantial store of onboard fuel, they can track and kill even the most evasive target---provided they are not intercepted by anti‐missiles, defense drones, clouds of smart dust, or even well‐placed relativistic exhaust. The opening phases of many fights are thus characterized by a massive deployment of both missiles and missile countermeasures.
>
> A special comment must be made here about the alien FTL *Raptor missile (not to be confused with the alien sublight *Ravager missile), though they are rarely deployed by alien frigates themselves, but rather by bombers, larger ships, and fixed batteries. Essentially a miniature, intelligent starship, these weapons strain the limits of detection and evasion for a standard Human frigate, and can pursue one into FTL for an appreciable length of time. Raptors play a fearsome opening role in fleet combat and hit‐and‐run raids alike, as the aliens often seek to seize a solid initial advantage. Fortunately for us, however, even the Cephalopods are hesitant to sacrifice FTL engines in great number, rendering Raptors a less‐than‐constant threat.
>
> Finally, there is saturation. Widely regarded as the least effective of approaches---space is a big place, after all---it is nonetheless always used simply because it is cheap. Missile complements eventually run empty, but a battery of kinetic guns firing clouds of proximity‐triggered guided projectiles, or disruption drones, or corrosive smart dust, can keep going almost indefinitely---and even rocks can be deadly at relativistic speeds. Standard frigates work hard placing swathes of these constant hazards throughout or before enemy zones, seeking to confuse, disorient, and overwhelm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chaos raged around Yuma, a storm of violence impossible for even the most heavily‐augmented soldier to follow. Spasms of hard radiation, missiles sailing by in glowing infrared, blossoms of smartdust, all against the backdrop of the starry void.

Yuma took a deep breath, filling her lungs with the recirculated air of her suit.

She dove, propelled forward through that frenzied void by a burst of red and green magic, some of it her own, most of it donated distantly by Charlotte. The physical hazards of the situation didn\'t bother her---she traveled with a phalanx of companions, a hundred spiraling hammers, each capable of engaging and destroying any drones that dared attempt to reach her. For the radiation, there was her zone of healing, a wave of green magic that could rebuild her almost immediately from anything short of an antimatter detonation.

She knew she cut out a striking profile, a streak of bright green tracing across the stars, obvious to every Ceph sensor in the area.

It didn\'t matter if they saw her, since they couldn\'t stop her.

Yuma summoned a hammer, a cat‐eared design she hadn\'t used in a long, long time, then multiplied its mass a thousand‐fold so that it would hit like a truck---if trucks traveled at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

As she flew, she passed the shattered hulks of her former picket ships, dead to the early Raptor barrage. She weaved her way past infrared missile streaks, marked by the gestalt as heading not for her, but for Kyouko\'s still‐distant ships, and briefly joined a couple friendly missiles heading the other way, providing them cover.

Finally, she vectored toward the nearby sparks of radiation and gravity distortions, where alien frigates swarmed around a fragment of the former asteroid, now animated by Rose‐Merline into an ad‐hoc defense platform.

What she saw---what her sensors saw, what Arisu\'s clairvoyance saw, what the gestalt saw---would have been dizzying to most, but not to her. The thoughtspeed of a magical girl, the expertise of an Ancient, the custom lace of cognition‐supporting implants she had installed---these guided her to her target, an alien frigate caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Part of her considered the possibility of shouting out her attack, à la Mami‐san, but even if no one could hear her...

She braced for impact, reinforcing her body with a surge of magic as the silhouette of the frigate filled her vision.

She slammed into its shield with an explosion of energy, telekinetically forcing her hammer home. Her body braced against the impossible strain, and a blast of radiation dazzled her eyes in every spectrum.

But the predominant color was green.

The shield failed an instant later, optical distortions spasming outward like a funhouse mirror. Yuma barely slowed as she smashed into the hull, cutting through the reinforced nanocomposite like so much paper shoji.

Yuma halted herself at an internal corridor, only her magic preventing the ship from buckling where her feet hit the floor. That magic flowed sinuously into the cracked composite beneath her, a sickly green hue soaking into the alabaster walls, the ceiling, and two unlucky nearby aliens. At her command, they collapsed to the ground, bodies decrepit and shrunken.

She left everything else as it was, even the support drones scurrying away in alarm. Her allies needed the ship intact.

Rin dove through the new hole in the roof soon after, spinning into a kick off the wall that sent her storming into the bridge. Rin\'s powers derived from a detective proficient in martial arts, and *that*, amplified by magic and power development, was a derecho of fist and foot.

Yuma charged after her, Jeannette in tow, but their support was unnecessary---the pilot was already dead at the helm, all but broken in half. The other personnel were in similar condition.

She and Jeannette kept moving, turning immediately towards the engine room in one smooth arc. They had to be done before any surviving personnel or the ship AI could attempt, say, an emergency self‐destruct.

Jeannette thrust her hand *into* a console, phasing through the surface to pulse in injections of white magic. An ornate set of binary digits spewed into the air, trailing sparks, as she rewrote the alien AI.

She relayed Yuma a mental map, and Yuma followed it to the frigate\'s forcefield generator. They needed it back online before the rest of the alien flotilla realized the ship was being commandeered.

She placed her hands on the surface of the machinery, reaching into it with her magic to understand what ailed it.

As she had thought, the generator wasn\'t damaged; it was temporarily out of power, drained from the burden of trying to prevent Yuma\'s entry. It just needed a recharge to come back online. That was something she could provide.

She had her suit queue up more grief cubes as she began pumping in power. The simple task gave more of her cognitive shards time to evaluate the battle---they had been too occupied just managing its present.

Surviving the opening fusillade of Raptor missiles had been a near thing, a feat worthy of magical girls their age, but other than *HSS Raven*, Yuma\'s security escort had been too distant and too vulnerable to save.

Still, those mostly uncrewed ships, controlled by AIs with regular backups, had bought valuable time, nearly twenty seconds, enough for Charlotte to teleport the Spec Ops teams and other mundane personnel off the asteroid before its destruction. Furthermore, by absorbing the Raptor missiles, the primary payload of the Ceph bombers, they spared Kyouko\'s more valuable outlying fleet, which was only a little less vulnerable to Raptors.

In the usual pattern, a bombing was the end of it---the target didn\'t typically survive---but this time, the bombers\' escorts had lingered behind for clean‐up. It seemed the aliens knew they had valuable, wounded prey.

Indeed, the situation was poor. Yuma\'s fleet was down to just Raven and a few of her support drones, and Kyouko\'s approaching squadron of MSY ships couldn\'t match or escape alien fighters and frigates. If either Kyouko\'s fleet or Yuma\'s team suffered many more casualties while separate, they\'d be enveloped and annihilated.

Nor could they count on reinforcement. There *were* reinforcements scrambling from Yenisei, but they would likely arrive far too late to matter.

At least Yuma could discern the contours of the alien escorts\' plan, now, hidden in the ephemeral vectors and formations of their attack. Once seen, it was simple, even obvious---keep Kyouko from linking up with Yuma for as long as possible, and rely on simple attrition to do the work. The odds were stacked in their favor.

The countermove was obvious too: use brazen attacks to make the squid focus on Yuma\'s Ancients and Raven, wait for a thus less‐scathed Kyouko to link up with them successfully, and don\'t die in the process.

Luckily, that had been her first instinct.

*Done,* she thought, pulling her hands away as the ship\'s forcefields came back to full power.

By then, Jeannette had successfully taken over the ship\'s AI and helm. It was a brutal affair, seizing control of a sentient being, but Yuma could find poetic justice in it. Someone had done the same to MG, after all.

*It says a lot that they managed to bring frigates to this attack,* Rin thought, as Yuma returned to the bridge. *Frigates are not generally equipped for raids. This was a complex operation, something like Spec Ops. Which means they know what they\'re here for.*

Yuma frowned, dedicating one of her cognitive shards to Rin\'s point, unwilling to shift her primary consciousness away from the battle.

*Jeannette says the armament of this ship is unusual,* Rin commented. More hard radiation bombs, less anti‐ship weaponry. Lots of novel adjustments. Either this is a new model, or they came equipped to bear.*

*I take your point,* Yuma replied, in the clipped tones of accelerated thought. *But there are other deductions to be made. It suggests that the human group infecting the TCF doesn\'t have as much influence in Governance as we thought, if they have to resort to calling aliens for help.*

*Not necessarily,* Rin thought. *An alien attack is much more deniable than an attack by human vessels, even drone ships. And it would have taken a lot of drone ships to take us down.*

*Yes, but it still suggests they care to keep it deniable,* Yuma replied. *Whatever the case, they miscalculated. This isn\'t enough ships. Not if they wanted to be one hundred percent sure.*

It was a bold assertion to make, given their desperate situation, but she meant it. They had a fighting chance---which was sloppy. Any well‐executed operation would have made sure they had no chance at all.

*Perhaps Kyouko wasn\'t meant to be here,* she added.

Her cognitive shard fired an alert then, a machine memory of Kyouko replaying itself at the edges of her awareness, abbreviated to save time.

*...following up on some of Joanne Valentin\'s old travels... a local sighting that sounded very much like Misa Virani... ...Tanaka‐san reported on the letter to me... ...it was about Homura, after all...*

She filed the insight away, tagging it for upload to an MG‐controlled server as soon as battle conditions permitted.

Then she reclaimed the resources, turning them back to the battle at hand, as their stolen ship narrowly evaded a barrage of laser fire, pulling up violently and threatening to flatten them into the floor.

This battle---really more of a brawl---defied the neat three‐dimensional patterns of major fleet combat, or even the rhythmic patterns of orbital combat. The gravity of the broken asteroid was negligible, the ships small and fast, and that had meant combat degrading into a frenetic scrum around Yuma\'s remnant, the alien fighters darting in and out of their frigates\' drone cover, difficult to intercept, while Rose\'s Ancient‐fortified rock dodged, diverted, countered, or absorbed blow after terrible blow.

Arisu and Charlotte were aiding Rose; Kana reinforced the nimble Raven. Beyond all of that, long‐range exchanges raked the enormous zone preceding the mass of Kyouko\'s approaching ships, who were sticking close together to provide mutual support.

Well within the brawl, Yuma\'s commandeered frigate blasted a spread of flak and dust across the projected flight paths of several fighters, making itself felt in a combat environment that was otherwise alien‐dominated. Jeannette\'s magic helped tremendously---reversing the squid munitions\' understanding of friend and foe would have otherwise been impossible, even with a lab and a decade of Governance funding.

They had results immediately, a curtain of programmable matter chewing through a squadron of drone escorts in time for their flak to rupture the forcefields of a passing fighter. Bereft of its own drone support, it was blinded by a barrage of EM pulses from a set of Raven\'s drones flying nearby. The alien fighter then began a series of frantic evasive maneuvers, failing to spot a missile that soon smashed straight into its belly.

Taken altogether, it seemed choreographed, but it was really a series of flukes, a phalanx of statistical measures and countermeasures that today, for less than a second, this particular alien fighter had rolled poorly on.

There was no time to cheer a small victory, as their stolen ship continued to weave its way away from the other alien frigates, unloading everything it had. To survive, they needed to make everything out of these initial moments.

That was a challenge complicated by the frigate\'s lack of a human‐compatible command interface---everything relied on the ingenuity of the AI Jeannette had enslaved. There would be no integration into the combined‐fleet Command Gestalt, a disappointing constraint when that gestalt was already so dangerously overstretched.

With that thought, part of Yuma\'s mind splintered off, joining the considerable chunk already given over to Command.

Then that chunk requested a bit more of herself, just a little, to watch Vlasta deploy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vlasta\'s squad exuded a kind of honed anticipation---anticipation not in excitement, but in grim stillness, the kind that watched a bloody fray and simply waited silently.

Emotional suppression was strictly off---it wasn\'t necessary, not yet.

They were waiting for Kuroi Kana to teleport them to an alien frigate, the second to be targeted after Yuma\'s. Human Spec Ops squads like Vlasta\'s were meant for ground combat, normally, but here every warm body *had* to be put to use, and if they could pretend a frigate was a ground command bunker, then that\'s where they would go.

Still, they were nervous. Not because of the sense of impending combat, or even the mismatch between their training and the target, but rather the sheer *uncertainty*.

Their implants ensured that they knew, on the level of instinct, when the *HSS Raven* would finally pass close enough to perform the teleport. The problem was, that instinct wasn\'t quite *right*. Not when a last millisecond change in the conditions of battle---the target ship changing course abruptly, or Raven herself needing to evade---could scramble the timeframe, or even cancel the insertion entirely, something that had already happened twice.

And this was all assuming, of course, that the Raven would stay intact through the final approach, a dicey proposition in and of itself. Raven\'s complement of drones was nearly depleted, and even at a distance she now relied heavily on Kana for defense. That meant Vlasta\'s squad would be on their own once deployed, and moreover that it\'d be some time until Kana and Raven were back in a position to teleport them out.

So they waited, in an awkward circular formation only regularly used by MagOps to fulfill the needs of certain kinds of teleporters. Two of them had their weapons raised, two others knelt to give their comrades clear firing lines, and Vlasta crouched as part of a trio, intending to vault into a new position the instant after the teleport. Sets of drones clutched to their legs and sides, attached with a variety of arms and coils.

Kuroi Kana was seated a small distance away, cross‐legged, eyes closed, and completely still. Having no innate sense for magic, it was only Vlasta\'s combat interface which put the lie to the statuesque image: the Ancient was fighting off the squid, claw and tooth, with every ounce of her ferocious might.

As the time approached again, a ring of black magic bubbled up through the solid floor. The bubbles accumulated and undulated until they surrounded all the Human Spec Ops, bathing them in an eerie glow.

Vlasta felt the familiar rush of combat hormones burning through her, energy‐intensive support systems spinning up all at once---shock absorption, fine‐grained circulatory regulation, advanced reflex augments, subjective time dilation. These would integrate with her suit, some even drawing on it for auxiliary power.

Many thought they had sacrificed a piece of their humanity for what they did, that their combat enhancements diminished their soul, every new chemical or computer knocking off another chip.

What a laughable notion.

*Go,* Kana thought, and the world churned in a sea of black, until Vlasta glimpsed somewhere new through the receding froth.

Alien personnel were standing at their stations around a frigate\'s bridge, as yet oblivious, the dream‐like details smeared.

Then the world snapped into focus.

Vlasta slammed herself directly into a passing crewman, crushing it---him? her?---into the wall with killing force. Around her, a roar of firepower and precision grenades---projectiles equipped with the minimal guidance necessary to *latch onto* a target and shred it into a fine foam---tore through the bridge. In front of her, two of her drones applied similar devices to passing alien drones, blowing them apart in a shower of metal and sparks.

She knew without looking that the room was clear---more than that, she knew the exact position and status of every squadmate and every drone and all that they saw. It was a situational awareness that was as natural as breathing, and strained the relevant regions of her brain to the point of light damage.

So before she had finished slamming into the bulkhead, she was already redirecting her momentum, turning it into a roll behind the portable cover deployed by another pair of drones. From there, she could cover her team on the angles she knew were exposed.

As she and the others found transient safety, explosive charges blasted the AI\'s central computing clusters, crippling the ship in a way that just killing the bridge officers wouldn\'t. That completed the first phase of the attack.

But as she brought her weapon up over the deployed cover, she knew things hadn\'t gone quite to plan. The AI was crippled, but an unexpected internal forcefield had sprung up around the engine room, barring their way to the FTL core and the most natural way to destroy the ship.

Their combined computing power quickly decided that attempting to overpower the forcefield was too ambitious. Instead, they had enough explosives to take out everything else of value. Once Kana pulled them out---hopefully beating any potential self‐destruct sequence---what remained of the ship would be at best a drifting FTL core enmeshed in a forcefield, a meaningless soap bubble, even if some of the crew still survived in the engine room.

Assignments rippled across the local network. Three members of the squad sprinted out to plant charges, advance drones clearing the way. Their targets included weapons control systems, the stealth generator, and several choice segments of hull in between. They would set the explosives on short timers, then get the hell out.

Even as the explosives were being set in place, they received bad news.

*\"Your ship\'s forcefields are down,\"* Kana transmitted, verbal message appended to the more straightforward machine language. *\"They must have somehow drained the power. You\'re being targeted. Raven\'s trying to fly back while keeping us in between you and the nearest enemy fighter, but her modeling says you have just seconds before another one\'s in range. I\'ll try to interdict them too, but it won\'t be easy.\"*

Callously sacrificial tactics were a squid specialty, of course, but knowing about that helped them little. With the barest minimum of warnings, and an accompanying overlay of anticipated zones of impact, they braced themselves, getting into safer spots and activating internal damage control modules.

In truth, even the most extensive of implant modifications could do little against the violence and speed of an unguarded starship strike.

She lost two members of her squad immediately, Dobrica and Wulandari, shredded so quickly even her augmented mind couldn\'t resolve the intermediate steps---one frame they were whole, and the next they were not.

There appeared to be no nearby hull breaches, but the shattered inside of the ship made it clear they had died to spalling. Not that it really mattered what had killed them: there was no tactical adjustment to be made, no real way to respond.

She was damaged too, her implants had informed her.

*\"---barely able to deflect the attacks,\"* a garbled transmission said, missing the critical command header that should have preceded it. "Able to miss FTL core. Will try my best. I\'m sorry.\"*

The voice pounded in her head, resonating with an unfamiliar pain, dulled to a distant roar by a healthy dose of implant‐mediated pain control.

*At least that\'s still online,* Vlasta managed to think, getting back on her feet, painfully aware that she and the four other surviving members of her squad were in bad shape. Besides the fact that her own internal diagnostics weren\'t entirely online, what she *could* see was terrible, ranging from the fact that her legs were operating by backup wire rather than nerve, to her sudden lack of one lung, to the rather large piece of metallic composite that had disabled her right arm. It would have all been much more distressing, were it not for the emotional suppression, which had turned on nearly full blast.

Though the rest of her team was already regrouping on her for a potential teleport---some carrying others---she reached a decision, one she knew her squadmates all agreed on.

*\"You need to leave us,\"* she transmitted. *\"It\'s not worth the risk to you or Raven.\"*

There was no response, and she couldn\'t even be sure she had been received.

Then the room lit up again, a warning red overlay signifying that local data sources expected them to be impacted across nearly the entire port side of the ship. Underneath the emotional suppression, she found herself apathetic, almost amused. Her connection wasn\'t good enough to communicate, but it *was* good enough to let her know how screwed they were.

She wasn\'t surprised, then, when the world went pitch‐black before her, and it took her a quarter‐cycle to realize that she was not yet dead.

It took another quarter‐cycle for her to realize that her optical implants hadn\'t adjusted yet, and she was actually floating in space, her immediate view blocked off by Kana, who was floating in front of her with hands raised, and Kana\'s magic, which had blotted out the stars.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To say that Raven wasn\'t really built for straight‐up fleet combat was, at best, a mild understatement.

There were stealth frigates that *were* intended to participate in fleet combat, of course. But even those inelegant brutes were intended to stay hidden and move quickly, deploying a critical mass of magical girls at critical locations in a battle.

Raven wasn\'t one of those, let alone a standard frigate *actually suited to this battle, and while she enjoyed the quality of her stealth drive, and didn\'t back away from fights, she could have used a bit more muscle right now.

She lived for battle. It was just, she preferred the part where she swooped over the corpse of an alien ship and gathered up her team, sending off a parting pair of clean‐up drones for good measure, where she gleefully imagined that they\'d peck out the eyes of the shattered squid vessel. So much more elegant.

In this fight, unfortunately, the squid were having most of the fun.

She wove her course into an intricate helix, strewing the area behind her with as much relativistic exhaust as possible to try and shake off the drones tailing her. With so many course corrections, it\'d be hard for anything to match her velocity, making her targeting cross‐section small indeed.

It was standard small ship tactics, dosed with desperation. She had very little left from her own smartdust and drone reserves, but still had plenty of fuel---the aliens had plenty of drones and firepower, but would have to conserve fuel if they had any intention of returning home from this deep in human space. Thus far, they had not shown the kind of aggressive maneuvers that suggested they had given up on that.

Pulling out of her maneuver, she fired her main kinetic batteries at the nearest alien frigate---while she would have loved a hit, realistically she just wanted the bastard to move. Captain Vera and the rest of Raven\'s crew were counting on her to stay alive, and that meant staying out of any close‐quarter laser knifefights.

On her own, she wouldn\'t have minded going out like this---she had already died once, after all, it wasn\'t so bad---but her captain and crew weren\'t inorganic enough to have backups.

She had finally found a good nickname for Vera, too, even if Vera hadn\'t yet figured out why she was \"Virginia\".

Her close‐in gunners, firing spreads of proximity mines, strafed the nearby area with complete abandon, knowing that here, so far away from Sakura Kyouko\'s support ships, there were very few friendly drones to accidentally take the hit.

As she expected, the alien frigate evaded her fire---but as it moved, it revealed a pair of Ravager anti‐ship missiles, launched from within its sensor shadow.

That was not a novel gambit---few things were in the relentlessly optimized field of ship‐to‐ship frigate combat---but there was little she could have done to guard against it, with her complement of defensive materiel so low. There simply hadn\'t been the resources to release anti‐missiles prophylactically.

But, she *had* pre‐gamed potential scenarios, and did what she had to---release the remainder of her defense drones and fire three point‐defense missiles behind her as she continued to evade. That would empty her reserves, but her tactical models suggested that it was the bare minimum action for a reasonable chance of survival. As the fleet mantra said: resources exist to be used.

Even if there were other threats soon to follow.

She didn\'t spend much of her sensor attention watching her back, as her final drone flotilla provided that crucial coverage. Instead, she scanned her way through the field of potential enemies in front of her, where her drones could and would not follow. Some enemy ships were engaged in longer‐range fire with Kyouko\'s ships, but others were clearly changing course to attack what must have looked like an easy target.

Unfortunately, unhappily, she didn\'t really think they were wrong.

Something flashed across her flank, burning through a sector of her forcefield and searing a scar across her armor. Not quite enough for a breach, but painful, forcing her to isolate the destroyed circuitry.

A *Sarissa* medium‐range laser, which she hated like all other frigates, because they were difficult to dodge and because human technology had no equivalent. Without smartdust, Raven\'s forcefields would be taking unmitigated hits from now on.

But she was still up, and that\'s what was important.

The way things usually worked for a stealth frigate in combat followed a specific pattern---get in close, endure inevitably being detected and having to go hot, drop off your cargo, stick around long enough to pick them back up, then make your way back as fast as possible to friendly ships. After that, you would refill drones and other materiel from a supply ship or capital ship, then go in for another run. It was risky work even at the best of times, but it was worth it for the occasional takedown of a major alien vessel.

In a way, what she was doing still fit in with that. She was in the "recovering cargo\" stage, working towards recovering Kana and the others before breaking contact.

But that was only in a way. She wasn\'t exactly in a situation standard doctrine covered: firstly, there wasn\'t a supporting capital ship in the picture, only a few of Kyouko\'s ever‐forthcoming supply vessels. Second, she had been revealed from the start: her state‐of‐the‐art stealth systems might as well have been a decorative collection of scrap metal. Thirdly, she was relying on Kuroi Kana for protection, which was both embarrassing and downright terrifying. Fourth, she should have been delivering a Magi Cæli team, not mundane Spec Ops. Finally, rather than attacking capital ships, they were attacking frigates, which threw the usual cost‐benefit analysis right out the rear airlock.

The riskiest bit was almost over, though. She had almost caught up to Kuroi Kana, who had split off a few seconds earlier to retrieve what Spec Ops she could, and once she teleported back on board, they could finally retreat towards Kyouko and resupply.

Then she sensed two alien fighters coming in for another pass. She had nothing meaningful left for them; they had been too fast, and were now too close.

She felt angry, and just a bit numb.

*That was it, then,* she thought, even as she turned to minimize the damage, activated what damage control she could, and sent her crew complement to their prearranged shelter stations.

She broadcasted a smoldering diatribe at the squid---not that they would, or maybe could, read it---and then emptied her mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Captain Vera didn\'t waste any time pondering the remarkable fact that she was still alive.

Many of her ship\'s systems were even still responsive, falling back onto less‐sentient decentralized subroutines. Even part of Raven\'s AI was still operating, individual modules that could still provide some value, even if they no longer formed a coherent personality.

Vera felt sorry for that, though she had every reason to be a bit preoccupied at the moment.

She pushed herself off of the ground with both arms, realizing then that both of her auxiliary wrist ports had stayed stubbornly connected, explaining how she was still tenuously connected to her ship---there was no way wireless would have provided the necessary bandwidth.

She leaned on her arms against a console, glancing at the shards of AI core which had cut across the room and at the ruined command chair she had once sat in. It was a minor miracle the circuitry still worked well enough to tie her in, one that she couldn\'t spend any time appreciating. Nor could she mourn the loss of Raven, the friend she had known for only a short while---even if she had every reason to expect to meet Raven\'s backup in due time, *if* she survived.

By artful evasion and nearly blowing out the forcefield power systems, they had mitigated much of the bombardment from the fighters, enough that the armor had been able to absorb most of the damage. Over half the crew was still alive, and most were already working on emergency repairs, while several complements of drones rushed to a major hull breach in the front, temporarily patched over by a forcefield.

With Raven gone, they were much less of a contributor to the Command Gestalt. With their drones and smartdust gone, they were no longer capable of meaningfully defending themselves or escaping. Having some forcefields and some weapons hardly mattered at that point, and in the ordinary course of things she\'d be considering a suicide tactic, converting the ship into a pseudo‐SHERMAN round by detonating the exotic matter in the ship\'s drive core and impeding alien navigation---anything was better than simply dying in place.

But they weren\'t out of cards to play yet.

Kuroi Kana teleported into the staging area of the ship then, bringing with her the survivors of the Spec Ops team.

*\"Well I\'m glad to see you,\"* Vera transmitted, with the kind of dry understatement that so often vexed Raven. *\"We could use some help.\"*

*Shit,* Kana thought.

She sat down on the floor, closing her eyes and steadying herself with almost inhuman speed.

*Bring me your wounded,* Vera heard her think. *I can help them, but they need to be closer.*

The message echoed into the ship\'s comms, even as Vera focused on taking over the duties of the ship\'s dead pilot. With the lack of a ship AI, that seriously drained her command attention, but right now navigation was more important than anything.

She changed the ship\'s course, steering it hurriedly and evasively toward Kyouko\'s onrushing vanguard, trusting Kana to use whatever magic she had to attempt a defense.

According to the calculations, trying to save Vlasta\'s team had been a justified effort, a dose of added risk to recover an asset that might still be useful in boarding other ships. Combat was an endless series of informed gambles, and sometimes, you got burned.

With the eyes that had once belonged to Raven, Vera looked at the stream of drones and magical girls that stretched outward to receive them. Her fate---the fate of her ship and its crew---rested with them now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ceri Jordà was one of the few experienced flight leaders in Kyouko\'s force.

The best of the Magi Cæli, those with training and experience, were naturally almost all at the front, not lurking somewhere where the Church of Hope could easily request them for even the shortest of missions. *She* had been on leave, hard‐earned after a year of patrols culminating with the Battle of Orpheus---and even after that, weeks spent helping shepherd alien remnants not‐so‐politely out of human space.

The truth was: returning back to civilian life, staring into the abyss of the family she no longer had, roaming the bars for companionship, or blankly trawling the internet or Grapevine, simply hadn\'t felt like much of an improvement to her. Even the blandishments of her MHD shrink, which had been so warm and empowering in the early years, had felt hollow and distant, the subtle telepathy powerless to really make a mark on her.

Somehow, when Sakura Kyouko herself had come knocking, she could tell in the old woman\'s eyes that she understood what it was like to feel no taste for life, a sort of desperation for meaning.

She had joined the Church for *that*, not for a strange doctrine about an illogical Goddess and her fervent followers.

She hadn\'t expected she\'d be back out here so quickly.

*We need to get over there and in front of Raven,* she thought. *It\'s not going to last much longer unless Kuroi pulls a miracle out of her ass.*

*Not all of us can make it that quickly. Is this really wise? We\'re going to be strung out.*

*It\'s not so much a matter of wisdom as whether we really have a choice,* she thought. *Kuroi Kana is a crucial asset. Those on board the ship are valuable personnel, if we can just get them back intact. We can take a little risk.*

With that, she gathered herself and sprung forward, adding to the acceleration of her suit with a hefty dose of her personal magic, which scorched her back with airless fire. She pushed herself far beyond the formation, with only two others able to trail behind her. They would have to do.

She did not begrudge them their doubt. It was natural for a group inexperienced with space combat to misjudge the situation. Up here, the relationship between magical girl and starship was much different than between magical girl and infantryman, in a way that was difficult to instinctively assess.

She arrived in time to find a swarm of alien drones trying and failing to reach the husk of Raven, bobbing and weaving their way through a haunted graveyard of their former brethren, puppeted by Kana with black wisps of magic. The drones, dead and alive, formed an angry cloud of metal encompassing the frigate.

Bracing herself, Ceri dove in, releasing a wave of fire in front of her that carbonized incoming missiles and smartdust alike.

*Finally,* Kana thought, as Ceri pulled abreast of the ship. The Ancient\'s impatience was mixed with relief and even gratitude.

Without preamble, Ceri\'s mind was flooded with what could only be described as visions, imagery of aliens in cockpits, fighters maneuvering, alien combat diagrams.

It should have been confusing, even overwhelming, but somehow it wasn\'t, and Ceri understood instantly.

*They\'re about to make another pass,* one of the other girls, Armelle, thought, arriving next to her. *Lasers only this time. They might be out of Ravagers.*

Ceri smiled grimly, even though this was, at best, mixed news. It accentuated exactly *why* someone like Kana had to be kept alive. That kind of clairvoyance couldn\'t be manufactured in any shipyard.

Ceri felt it was a nice reminder of why her work was important.

She assessed what resources they had, using her own analysis to help spare their overtaxed Command Gestalt.

One mostly crippled frigate, with limited capabilities beyond passive defense and some return fire. Four magical girls: one Ancient, but inexperienced with and not specialized for this kind of combat, not really a combat mage to start with. Two more with distantly relevant abilities---Armelle, an area‐of‐effect ranged attacker, and Amaranth, who could turn incorporeal. Both useful, but not directly suited to the moment, more so because they were also *inexperienced*.

And her, of course.

The four of them, plus ship and surviving crew, would have to face down nearly two dozen strafing fighters, for long enough that the others could catch up. That would not be very long in a human sense, but it was plenty of time for everything to fall apart, if their reactions weren\'t on point.

They faced the problem, then, that while Amaranth and Armelle were capable of eluding and dealing good damage to the attackers, neither was especially suited for defense, a role that would normally be filled by a strong barrier generator rather than Kana. Worse yet, while a group of sublight missiles gave them time to react, deflect, and defeat in detail, lasers were threatening precisely because they gave almost none---and of course each fighter could fire multiple times. They were also tricky for Kana to deal with---that she could divert lasers *at all* with telekinesis spoke to her finesse as an Ancient.

Ceri made the only reasonable decision then, even as her thoughts filtered into the gestalt and their group telepathic network.

*Alright,* Kana thought. *Godspeed.*

Kana provided them advance warning of the aliens\' final attack angles, and Ceri wasted no time preparing, cocooning herself into her fiery wings. Even through her suit, she could feel the heat from the fire, which suffused all she could see with a glowing orange light.

She dissolved into that light, now a pale blue flame that raced outward in a growing ball of incandescence, passing through her squadmates and through *HSS Raven*. She enveloped the area, seeing everywhere at once, with eyes that were not eyes.

Ceri could be a barrier generator, if she wanted to.

*Gotcha, bastards,* Amaranth thought.

The alien fighters were clearly befuddled by the unknown magic---she had fought the Ceph long enough she was sure they had a profile on her type of magic, but this, no alien had ever seen---or, at least, seen and escaped. All but one dove aside, bombarding her wall of fire with whatever weaponry they had on board. One of them chose, or was perhaps selected, to dive straight in.

She felt the sudden roaring heat of her own flames torched white‐hot against the fighter\'s forcefield.

The ship slowed precipitously, completely halted, and then blew apart, its pieces incinerating into magical ash, which wafted away into nothing.

The other fighters did not get off easily---a fusillade of Armelle\'s bright red rockets streaked through Ceri\'s fire and honed in on one, its attempts at evasion seeming hapless compared to the aliens\' usual elegant flight.

The aliens lost three other fighters---two when Kana telepathically seized control of one and slammed it sideways into another, driving them both into Ceri\'s barrier, and the third when Amaranth ghosted in front of it, leaving a small explosive *inside* its FTL core, immaterial long enough to let the starship get some distance.

All of that came at a cost, though.

She was not naturally a barrier generator. Everything that had been thrown at her---kinetic shells, lasers, waves of escort drones, even a number of the hard radiation bombs the aliens loved to use on magical girls---was reflected in the corruption filling her soul gem. In this form she and the fire were one and the same, so all the damage she took had to be healed back. Fortunately, she could use the grief cubes she had been carrying, even in this state. Less fortunately, there was no way for the others to give her any more, and she had already burned through more than half of hers.

Just as she was considering reverting to normal form, Kana signaled a wave of missiles, this time frigate‐launched as a follow‐up to the fighters, who were already circling for another pass---it was so much firepower that it seemed to be draining the aliens\' strength elsewhere.

*Will you be alright?* Amaranth thought, aware of Ceri\'s power state.

*I don\'t know,* Ceri thought, honestly.

There was no need to say more than that. Given the circumstances, they knew it wasn\'t worth the risk of Ceri dropping her barrier, and whether Ceri consulted the gestalt\'s projection of her magic usage or her own instincts, the answer was the same: *Uncertain*.

Everything now counted on how quickly they could reunite with the rest of their force, and how much damage the aliens could deliver before then. If Ceri could just keep the barrier up *long enough*, then they would make it. Even if she dropped it a bit early, it might still be enough.

The others did what they could, Kana using her telekinesis to force missiles off course, Armelle throwing up a wall of rockets, and *HSS Raven*\'s crew picking two off with well‐placed flak---but that still left a good half‐dozen to burn up in her barrier, which flickered with painful strain.

She cycled through her grief cubes with the avidity of a forest fire through parched grass and tapped dry.

Then the fighters began to return.

This time, they didn\'t just strafe. Instead, they matched velocities with the Raven and its mage escorts, pummeling Ceri even as the others rushed to take them out.

The rest of her team was almost here...

*You can\'t hold this,* Kana thought. *Drop it, drop it now!*

The message washed away for a moment, as Ceri felt her focus slipping. Would it even matter, if she did? There were so many---

She canceled her fire form then, the giant wall of flame contracting into the shape of a phoenix, then the shape of a human.

The alien fighters dove in immediately, and Ceri watched helplessly as their blows poured down on the ship.

One of the fighters then abruptly blossomed into a rose of debris, and fresh colors of magic began streaking into the fight. Backup was here, it seemed.

Or perhaps it was just her mind playing tricks on her, Ceri thought, smiling grimly. It had a bit of an unreal quality to it, the fighters dancing across the stars, the magic taking on the colors of the rainbow---and she had lost track of the Raven.

Then she toggled her soul gem eject, releasing the adhesion between gem and body and allowing her suit to cast it out into the void, away from the fighting as much as possible, for a potential recovery. Her soul gem cover had limited onboard guidance and telemetry---perhaps that would be enough.

Ceri was no stranger to soul gem exhaustion, after all. She knew she was running out of time. She would have to count on her team to catch it---catch *her*.

She felt the swirl of her own regrets blacken the world, and knew there was no fighting it, no maintaining her grasp on reality. It would take her where it wanted, and then she would either come back, or not.

Ceri saw again the images of her childhood---her parents, her siblings, filtered by what even she recognized as saccharine nostalgia.

When the aliens had come, she had been on another habitat, taking in schooling for a specialty in astrophysics, a topic she had once thought she loved.

*When the time came, you wished for vengeance,* the voice said. *You wished to kill the monsters. But you didn\'t wish for your family back.*

\"I damn well know that,\" she said, through lips she knew she didn\'t have. \"Don\'t put me through this shit again. It was stupid, okay?\"

But the words stung. It was impossible for them not to. They came from her, after all.

After all these years, the guilt still gnawed at her, the ghostly apparitions of a happier life, a more normal life playing at the edges of her mind.

She hated having to go through this. In waking life, she was over this---a combination of time and MHD work had plugged up the wounds, even if she still felt uncomfortable in sedate, civilian life.

But that didn\'t matter here. It never had.

\"Well that\'s enough of that,\" a voice said, a searing light that filled her soul.

Ceri\'s mind seemed to clear in an instant, and when she looked up at the woman standing over her, it was with a sense of... surprise? Awe? Trepidation?

She shook her head at herself and stood up from where she had been, apparently, curled up on the ground, taking a moment to pat off her costume. She knew, of course, that a moment ago she had been in combat, and should have just been a soul gem barreling desperately through space.

Instead, she was in a field of starblossoms, a memory from one of the few times she had visited a planet as a child. Looking on it, she felt the irrational sense that, wherever she was, things were going to be fine. Serenity, some might call it.

And as for the woman standing before her, which had replaced the apparition haunting her...

Well, however terrible she was as a member of the Church, she could recognize a psychopomp when she saw one.

\"I don\'t suppose you\'re here to offer me a chance to go back,\" she said.

\"That\'s not generally how that works, no,\" the woman said, still facing away from her. She was holding one of the blossoms and wore a wide‐brimmed hat with a simple white sundress. Whatever Ceri might have expected the hypothetical Goddess to look like, it wasn\'t this.

Well, actually, the pink hair was close.

\"I was hoping for longer than this,\" Ceri said, crouching to pick a flower. \"But I guess that was always a bit silly, given how dangerous my combat role is.\"

She stopped, arm half‐extended, staring at the flower she had intended to take. For a moment, she thought she could see through it, somehow. There was no flower, there was no *her*, there wasn\'t even a Goddess. Yet here she was.

It really hit her for the first time that she was dead.

\"I suppose I should just be glad there\'s anything at all,\" she said. "Before you take me to the next world, can I at least ask how things went in that fight? I died there, after all.\"

The woman turned her head towards Ceri then, slowly, eerily. She found her gaze drawn compulsively to the deity\'s eyes, even as she found herself afraid of what she would see within.

\"Ceri,\" the Goddess said, as she felt the edges of her soul begin to tear open. \"You don\'t need my help for something as simple as that.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuma learned of the destruction of the *HSS Raven* as she was preparing to leave the second frigate she had seized.

Kyouko\'s magical girl escort had gotten to the Raven piecemeal, and too late, but most of them had survived. Kana had even managed to teleport out with many of the humans on board, just in time. The alien fighters had pulled back. But still.

*Not good enough,* she thought, allowing herself a little dismay---just a little. She didn\'t allow herself to check this time how Vlasta was doing.

Yuma took a deep breath, settling herself. With Raven out of the picture, it was only more important she and her Ancients continued to make an impact, eroding the alien advantage as much as possible. Without dying, of course.

*Alright, let\'s go,* she thought, looking at Rin.

They turned and sprinted towards the ship\'s airlock. They wouldn\'t have stayed even if Raven had survived---the two of them did little good just standing there watching Jeannette direct the new ship. Either they needed to go outside and *escort*, as they had with the first frigate, or they needed to go group up with Kyouko. Every second they wasted was potential losses elsewhere, in a fight as tight as this.

Yuma didn\'t spare a glance for the stars visible through a hundred fist‐sized holes in the hull. The wheels in her head turned constantly, interfacing with the gestalt, evaluating their current location, keeping up a constant chatter between her implants and Rin\'s---deciding simply what to *do*.

As the door to the airlock opened itself to pure vacuum, though, they stopped. Having beaten the optimal launch time by a few seconds, a shard of Yuma now took the chance to look out into the void. To human eyes, there were few visible signs of battle---the field of stars was nearly untrammeled, and it was impossible not to hear the voice in the back of her head, the ancient instinct warning her not to jump off the cliff, because she was assuredly *not coming back*.

Most human ships came with a small catapult for just this kind of deployment. Here, it was again possible to borrow Charlotte\'s telekinesis, but it would be better now to let her focus on Kyouko\'s girls.

Rin picked Yuma up and vaulted into space, accelerating nigh‐instantly to an incredible, bone‐shattering speed. Moving so fast it seemed like teleporting was part of the skillset of a martial artist, in movies anyway. That was the excuse Rin had used to develop the power.

Yuma followed the trick with one of her own, summoning her hammer in front of them, growing its mass, then dispelling it, conserving momentum only the *second* time. Newton would not have liked the disrespect to his laws.

She felt a massive pulse of radiation slam into them, and felt her soul gem strain against the effort of healing off the damage. As a group, they had plenty of grief cubes, especially with Kyouko\'s added stock, but this style of fighting was enormously magic‐expensive. It could not be kept up indefinitely.

But then, neither could anything else in this fight---missiles, drones, smartdust, exotic matter fuel---it would all run out eventually, if the battle didn\'t end. At some point, the alien ships would have to turn away to ensure they could even return home. Assuming they cared to, and assuming they lived that long.

They flew in a great arc, passed the living asteroid fortress, and then a series of colored streaks announced that, as promised, some of Kyouko\'s teams were finally managing to reach them. The maroon‐colored streak peeled off, a junior shield generator that would be joining them for another push forward, grief cubes on hand.

The new girl exchanged the most perfunctory of electronic greetings with them as they turned, angling towards another alien vessel, navigating by fleet sensors. There was no question of Yuma and Rin simply retreating to safety within Kyouko\'s arriving fleet.

There was no safety.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Ryouko, fighting without her teleportation was like fighting without an arm. Worse, actually---she would have more easily handled a missing arm. Firing her arbalest only required one of those.

Indeed, she barely did anything at all as her squad bulldozed their way through the station, seeking urgently either the device blocking Ryouko\'s teleports or---less likely---another way to get Asami back to the wormhole before the Ceph could shred it. Ryouko stayed safely in the back as the others did all the work, her usual \"combat mood\" remaining frustratingly out of reach.

As her team advanced with near‐reckless haste, they were forced to simultaneously conduct an important debate.

*Her wormholes are a physical effect,* Asami thought, answering a question. *Like my black holes. For us, the manipulation* is *the magic. Neither of us have managed to generalize it yet.*

*There\'s literally only one teleporter using wormholes!* Simona thought. *Why build a trap* here specifically?

*That may not be the intent,* Amane thought. *For all we know, it\'s part of a system with some other purpose. It may not even be combat‐related.*

So she said, and Ryouko had to agree with the logic. After all, it wasn\'t that her magic wasn\'t *there*, it just... felt like she was out of teleports, like she needed to recharge, only her sense of when she would never drew closer.

She couldn\'t shake the unnerving feeling in her heart, though. It felt* personal.

The group came to a momentary halt, their rampage across the circular doorways and nearly‐cylindrical alien hallways stymied by the appearance of a massive, station‐wide forcefield.

Ryouko looked back on the path behind them, strewn with debris and gutted walls. Caution required that they preemptively destroy every piece of unrecognized equipment they came across, and a controlled singularity was a *very* effective tool of destruction. None of the previous forcefields---powered by local generators---had stood any chance when Asami\'s weapon could carve straight through forcefield and generator alike with little fanfare.

This one was different. The generator was far away---it was not easy to know where---and Asami\'s black hole was not passing trivially through.

The station lurched, once, hard enough to have thrown them off their feet were it not for Ying‐zhi\'s barrier, which rippled warningly. That served as their indirect reminder that they needed to get a move on.

*What kind of forcefield blocks black holes?* Simona thought.

*Alien ones,* Asami thought. *Well, some of them. The main starship ones all give resistance.*

She tried again to force her way through, the collision of black hole and forcefield forming an almost kaleidoscopic lensing effect, the natural lensing of the black hole amplified and magnified throughout the area.

*Well, whatever is blocking my power, it\'s behind this forcefield, Ryouko thought, feeling the discordant hum of her soul gem pulling at her. *Probably not a coincidence.*

It was a dilemma, and one they did not have time to ponder. They were still in the core of the station, buried a full half‐kilometer away from its surface. According to the fleet clairvoyant now tasked to them, nearly all of that remaining distance was solid composite or machinery, and the aliens had blown the more human‐sized tunnels leading to the surface. Getting out the hard way would take most of the few hundred seconds the fleet gestalt estimated they had before their wormhole was unsalvageable.

*Well, we ain\'t got much of a choice,* Amane thought. *This is gonna be expensive.*

She signaled Ying‐zhi and another girl, and the two formed up as Amane fell back, taking over barrier generation for the team. Ying‐zhi dropped her own barrier, and then resummoned it in the shape of a sharp, golden nail.

The other girl pulled out her signature weapon, an oversized metal mallet with a pulsejet engine attached, and as Ying‐zhi\'s nail contacted the alien forcefield, she gave the mallet a roaring swing.

There was a tremendous burning light at the very tip of the impact, accompanied by a reverberating roar that defied description, seeming to transform the entire sequence into a single, silent instant.

Then Ying‐zhi\'s barrier shattered like glass, the mallet slamming into the forcefield. Both barrier and mallet were dispelled before any stray pieces hurt someone, but the healer rushed in anyway to tend Ying‐zhi.

Before they could recover, a message arrived from Command: a MagOps team with a teleporter of sufficient range had been reassigned from a gravity modulator to their rescue, and would be there within two minutes.

Ying‐zhi staggered to her feet and cursed. The fleet could scarcely afford another team being pulled off the remaining gravity modulators.

Ryouko chewed her lip. She had *wanted* to learn what was blocking her, to *see* what was doing it and to prove to herself that it wasn\'t, somehow, directed at her specifically.

But there was no justification for making another attempt on the forcefield. The new teleporter, when she arrived, could pass right through it.

Perhaps, with her help...

Even then, it was hard to rationalize. Not when the aliens were so close to forcing the wormhole back open---close enough that they were getting glimmers of direct contact with Adept Blue. Not when spending any extra time here at all was a needless risk, prodding at a possible trap.

It bothered her enough, though, that she still had Clarisse file a suggestion to the group network, proposing one attempt with the new teleporter to search the station beyond the forcefield. To her surprise, Asami responded before anyone else.

*We can\'t,* she thought. *I know what you\'re thinking. But it doesn\'t make sense, especially when whatever it is actively weakens you.*

Amane, Ying‐zhi, and Simona signaled their agreement, the Command Gestalt signaled *its* agreement seconds later, and that was that. There would be no time to solve the mystery.

They waited uneasily, local space‐time protesting its treatment by the aliens with repeated, amplifying jolts. Finally, their rescue team arrived in a literal thunderclap, sparks snapping through the air around them.

*Let\'s go,* the teleporter, Oda, thought, from behind her winged goggles. Behind her, Ryouko was surprised to see Azrael, and surprised at herself for feeling so relieved at the prospect of traveling with another friend.

They had already received the bare minimum information they needed for the teleport---stand facing Oda, no need to touch each other, the trip would be a bit vertiginous, Oda needed to raise her spear---and with that, they were off.

The experience was entirely different from any of Ryouko\'s trips---rather than an instantaneous transit, it instead jolted them through* the intervening distance, so that they got an intimate view of the inside of alien machinery, composite armor, and finally, space.

When they reappeared in orbit, they were already in an optimal arrangement, individual bodies pointed in the direction of motion, Oda\'s magic having rearranged them as they traveled. Ryouko\'s suit had to make only minuscule adjustments to her velocity and orientation, and Clarisse took care of any potential disorientation, offloading enough spatial reasoning that where they were, where *she* was, was intuitive.

It was, Ryouko had to admit, more convenient than her own magic in that regard.

*I\'ve dropped us into a slightly lower orbit that will take us away from the station. My range isn\'t like yours. Can you teleport now?*

What went unsaid in that question were a number of details filled in by the Command Gestalt: the rescue team had a stealth mage, and so with Asami\'s gravitational protection, the two teams could expect to survive outside a ship where neither could alone. Their current orbit would start making close passes to the *HSS Marianne Rialle* within thirty seconds, close enough to transfer over for protection and transport, but the faster and therefore strongly preferred plan was a follow‐up teleport by Ryouko straight to the wormhole.

*I can,* Ryouko thought, holding her hands over her chest. It was a relieving feeling, enough for her to almost tune out the battle raging around her.

Then she shuddered, turning her head even as the gravity sensors on her suit started alerting.

A quarter‐orbit before them, the sphere of the wormhole\'s mouth suddenly billowed open, its gravitational lensing effect obvious against the emissions from the pulsar. It was unhealthy, whirling erratically, a vengeful specter that alternated between blotting out the stars and glowing eerily in unpredictable parts of the spectrum. Each time it flared, it tossed aside a number of unlucky human starships caught in the wake.

They could only watch for an impatient dozen seconds, waiting for their lower relative orbit to bring them close enough for Ryouko to make a maximum‐range jump, their suits compensating for movement as both teams crowded around her, making for a colorful show against the backdrop of space.

The environment around the wormhole was, impressively, the most dangerous they had faced yet, and when Ryouko finished her teleport, slumping into her suit with brief exhaustion as her soul gem recharged, they did so with Ying‐zhi\'s barrier already up, absorbing a gravitational environment that threatened to tear them apart. Ryouko could have chosen a safer location, but it was imperative that Asami get as close as she could.

The portal through space warped and crackled, emitting sheaves of newborn radiation that hinted at the immense stresses inside. As Asami raised her hands to try and take control, hair swirling under the influence of unseen magic, the surrounding world shifted and stirred, the apparent position of the pulsar skipping below, behind, or above. Through the tortured space around them, it was possible to even observe temporal anomalies, electromagnetic radiation red‐shifted or blue‐shifted unpredictably.

It was no wonder that human ships had hurriedly evacuated the area, after having spent most of the battle defending the wormhole reopening site from alien drones and potential surprise attacks. For now, they seemed very much alone.

The dozen‐plus girls arrayed themselves in a small defensive shell around Asami, Simona settling into the meditative pose she used to enhance others\' powers. Ryouko watched the wormhole with eyes and sensors that were more than human, in more ways than one. Somehow, it looked a bit purple. Was that a natural color?

*This is difficult,* Asami thought, a claim well‐supported by her soul gem activity readings.

For the girls not actively concealing or defending the team, like Ryouko, the only thing to do was to submerge into the gestalt, which was still pondering how exactly the aliens were using their pulsar mines to manipulate the wormhole. The scientist in Ryouko---alongside the scientists of the fleet---was darkly fascinated by the opportunity to see those mines in action, despite the circumstances. To bottle up space‐time, after ripping it away like fruit from a tree, was a profound and inexplicable feat.

Even with Asami\'s contributions, answers weren\'t forthcoming, and the question had to be asked: Was this even worth understanding? Scientifically, of course, but practically it seemed likely they would have to destroy the alien mining infrastructure either way.

Something about it nagged at Ryouko, a vague uneasy feeling she couldn\'t dispel, similar to how she had felt when her teleportation had been inhibited earlier.

*I don\'t think you should ignore that,* Clarisse thought. *Yes, Asami knows gravity better than you, but we\'re standing at the mouth of a wormhole. Maybe you can help?*

Ryouko shook her head in dismay, but not in disagreement. Clarisse was right. What was she doing just watching? She could at least try.

Though, of course, she didn\'t know what *try* meant here.

She jetted her way up to Asami, placing a hand on her shoulder, and fixing her eye on the writhing sphere of the wormhole, searching the depths of her unease, casting about with her magic sense for the nature of what was happening around her.

*I have them at a stalemate,* Asami thought, as the kilometers‐wide opening in front of her seemed to shudder slightly. *But I\'m kind of stuck here, and I need Simona\'s magic just to keep this up. Can\'t quite close it. Can\'t even make it safely traversable. We\'re in real trouble if we decide to abort.*

She didn\'t add that maintaining this deadlock was very expensive, the point accentuated by a few human drones reappearing on their local maps, braving the now‐milder gravitational storms to haul in a supply of grief cubes.

It was a worrying result. But with Clarisse\'s help, Ryouko was making progress on her own front, and inferences were now working their way through her mind. Clarisse had been aggregating physical data on the wormhole and pulsar mines for a while, and coupled with Ryouko\'s magic sense, they could now discern patterns---*familiar* patterns, both in an instinctual sense, and because she still remembered what she had seen in Dr. Tao\'s lab on Eurydome, when she had been teleporting herself to exhaustion.

Whenever she made too many short teleports, it became harder and harder for her to continue, until eventually she couldn\'t at all, leaving her stuck---even if she still had plenty of magic. Something strange happened to space‐time; something that she could feel right now, in sections of the pulsar mines.

In retrospect, that made perfect sense. Ryouko tore at space‐time to make her wormholes, and the Cephalopodan mines tore away pieces of space‐time too---normally for containment and transport, but now just to yank at the wormhole. The initial physical action was the same, so of course the physical *reaction* was the same. There *had* to be a connection to what had blocked her from teleporting earlier.

But there were more immediate applications to work through.

If repeatedly tearing at space‐time made it progressively more difficult to accomplish, then the enormous alien mines were likely working on duty cycles, and a much narrower attack could now be planned, prioritizing only the operational regions which Ryouko could identify.

That was the good news. The bad news was, with this effect isolated, a subtler process could be detected. With Asami and Simona frustrating efforts against the wormhole, the aliens were adapting their approach yet again*. Ryouko had not personally seen a blink cannon in action, but if she understood what little humanity knew about them, then the aliens were building a giant ad hoc one out of the mines. And Ryouko was pretty sure she understood correctly, because Clarisse had been ceaselessly replaying the relevant lectures from Vlad and Dr. Tao at speed in the background of her mind.

*I\'m just doing what needs to be done,* Clarisse thought. *I\'m just helping the association process.*

*No, it\'s helpful,* Ryouko thought. *I\'m just frustrated with the situation. You\'re doing the right thing.*

Ryouko was surprised then by a tiny sense of satisfaction, even pleasure from Clarisse. She had said the right thing, apparently.

Clarisse was definitely helping, of course, and the TacComp\'s recent upgrades enabled her to run a few gravitonic simulations locally. That was enough for Ryouko to pick out a strange relationship between the activity in the alien mines and the oscillations in the mangled wormhole Asami was wrestling with.

And that reminded her...

*...of when you teleported the Orpheus team off‐world, taking advantage of the destabilized alien wormhole,* Clarisse thought. *The aliens are trying to exploit our wormhole the same way.*

Ryouko felt a queasy feeling sink into her gut. That explained how the aliens expected a blink cannon to work, when all past evidence suggested that the energy costs outside of low‐gravity environments were ruinous.

A disquieting thought rose back up from her gut, and caught in her throat: the Cephalopods knew the intricacies of space‐time better than Humanity did. They knew space‐time better than *she* did, even when it came to *her* magic. That magic might cover the absurd energy costs involved, but its tricks were not hers alone---they were also the squid\'s.

*That\'s not good,* Amane thought, in a masterpiece of understatement, as Ryouko\'s last update hit the gestalt. *What do we do now?*

Ryouko gritted her teeth, even as she mentally heard Command shifting teams into an emergency attack on the pulsar mines.

*I can invert the process,* she thought. *Or rather, if they\'re going to hijack our wormhole, I can hijack it first. If we act now, I can teleport most of us from here into the mines immediately. But there\'s no telling what we\'ll find in there, and I... hate to split us up right now.*

By which she meant, she hated the notion that she would take most of the combined team away from Asami, leaving her only scantly protected. More than that, Ryouko hated the notion that they be separate at all, and knew Asami would hate it worse.

There was no space at a time like this for such sentiment, however, and no sooner had she vocalized the thought than the order came through for them to make the attempt. A part of her regretted even bringing it up, but how could she not?

\"The danger is admittedly extreme,\" Ying‐zhi said, using the in‐suit audio. \"We have limited intel, we\'ll be deep behind their lines, and they\'ll be ready for us. But I have high hopes anyway, because it\'s always like this, and we still always come out on top.\"

\"I suppose you can consider the separation incentive to come back alive,\" Azrael said. \"I certainly don\'t expect to die here. Not after I made it out of... where I came from.\"

They were obviously addressing her, and Ryouko felt a cringe of embarrassment. Was it that obvious?

She overcame that, though, when she felt a ping from Asami and looked over. The girl wasn\'t looking back, focusing her attention on the wormhole, and Ryouko was at the wrong angle to see her face.

Still, the emotions that followed conveyed all that was necessary. Asami understood the necessity of splitting up, but she was scared, and angry. Scared for the both of them, but especially Ryouko, and angry at herself, because she was letting the squid do this to them.

Ryouko did manage to see Simona\'s expression---at least, what Ryouko\'s implants claimed it was, through an opaque helmet, for only the fractional second before the girl hid her face---and felt an undefinable guilt.

She didn\'t let herself think too much about that.

It took an unusual amount of time---a solid three minutes---for the gestalt, and the team, to decide on the proper way to divide the magical girls around Asami. They were heading into completely unknown territory, and for all their hundreds of variations, even the simulations had failed to really cover a situation like this. *Couldn\'t*, really. Unknown unknowns were harder than anything.

Both Asami and Ryouko\'s team would require a barrier generator, and there were three to go around, but Ying‐zhi, the one most capable of defending against gravitational effects, would be going with Ryouko. Asami was somewhat capable of protecting herself, after all, and Command could rush reinforcements over, but she would still receive Amane, the more experienced of the remaining two barrier generators.

Azrael would be going with Ryouko. While her natural comfort with three‐dimensional navigation was most useful in space, they didn\'t have any other MGs capable of mind‐reading or attempting mind‐control---versatile abilities when attacking an unknown base.

Where to put Simona was the easiest, yet most painful choice. Her ability to enhance another\'s power might make or break an attack on the mines. But the aliens were fighting as hard as ever to rip the wormhole to shreds, and Asami needed Simona\'s assistance, so Simona would stay with her.

This time Ryouko didn\'t try to catch Simona\'s expression.

Asami would also get the stealth generator, but in the end, no one was making it home if they didn\'t disable the pulsar mines, so the other members of the combined team would be sent with Ryouko.

While this decision was being made, Ryouko spent her time focusing on what she needed to do. She had harnessed an existing wormhole once, at Orpheus. She had a much better understanding this time of how it would work, and could even review it with Clarisse. But this time, there was no Goddess in her ear, giving an implicit guarantee of success. This attempt, and its result, would be hers alone.

When it was time to go, she felt as ready as she could ever be, watching the others assemble around her. At her instruction, they formed as compact a ball as possible, Simona taking the opportunity to hold her hand, filling her with power, but tensing to let go, just before the teleport.

*You\'ve got this,* Oda thought. According to the gestalt\'s battle simulations, Ryouko was disturbingly likely to find her teleportation blocked again after they arrived, and Oda\'s lightning‐based teleportation might have to bail them out a second time.

Ryouko realized, then, that she had almost forgotten something.

She blinked over next to Asami, the universe around her snapping into a new configuration, and grabbed her hand. The suits were in the way, but it would have to do.

*I\'m ready,* she thought, blinking herself back to her team.

She closed her eyes, and stretched herself outward, reaching for the place where the aliens were trying to breach. It was already so, so weak...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Damn it!\" Kyouko snapped, heedless that the others could hear her over the suit radio.

The aliens were tenacious, ferocious, and overwhelming, and the screening groups near her ships were taking the brunt of it, held together by a thin assembly of drones, smart mines, and magical girls. Together they strained to stay coherent and mutually supporting, even as they worked to get into a position where they could lay into their enemies, who were obstinately, annoyingly, staying just out of range. As they did so, the fighters harried Kyouko\'s ships, obviously hoping to kite them to death with their superior reach.

This frustrating situation had forced them to continue using Yuma\'s Ancients as risky frontline raiders. They were already amidst the aliens, voluntarily or not. If they got some damage in---and especially if they kept seizing ships---it *really* helped the combat projections.

Things hadn\'t worked out with Raven but, if one tallied it all up like an Incubator, even that had been a fair exchange---a one‐for‐one trade of frigates, and a swap of some fighters and materiel for a veteran magical girl. They could have done even better if they hadn\'t gambled on saving the Spec Ops squad. Then again, they *needed* to do better---this wasn\'t a fair bout of chess, where equal trades would lead to a draw. It was more like a match where they had started off with far too few pawns.

Kyouko gritted her teeth. She didn\'t like that kind of thinking. But they hadn\'t been prepared for this fight. Against Cephalopods, she had far too many magical girls for the number of ships she had. She would have easily traded some for a single military‐grade cruiser.

Her mistake. She had known this was a possibility, and then she had let secrecy and poor communication restrict the scope of her response. Now, out here in the black depths of space, she was losing people.

She spun herself into a new position, riding the point of the giant spear she was using as a platform. As she turned, her hair blasted out a spiral of airless fire, destroying a wave of alien smartdust that had dared to approach.

At least Yuma\'s Ancients were holding up, even if none of them were natural frontline fighters. On top of the ship raiding, they brought a welcome injection of well‐developed magic---long‐range clairvoyance, improved telepathy, multi‐target mind‐control, telekinetic movement, all the general stock‐in‐trade arts of magical girls like Kuroi Kana and Atsuko Arisu.

Even so, Kyouko would have preferred Ancients more like herself, capable of contributing seriously in more... tangible ways. Sending out Ceri\'s group had stretched her defenses, and even with seriously‐in‐advance forecasting from Arisu, a barrage of missiles had just now nearly broken through, absorbed at the last second by a decoy starship, an apparition of Maki\'s magical paint that stubbornly presented itself on every sensor as the real deal.

It took Maki only the briefest of moments to sketch out a replacement, but that was enough time for an enemy drone wave to pierce the perimeter and begin swarming soft targets.

Two magical girls went down---damaged, but still fighting. Recoverable, but only for a few more seconds.

Kyouko swallowed a bitter oath---at Maki for being slow? at herself for not being there?---and launched a wave of javelins instead. They flew out from her in what looked like a standard volley of projectiles, heading directly for the flotilla of alien drones. The flotilla moved to dodge---and then the javelins turned into massive nets of chain, snarling themselves around the alien drones before dissolving in fire.

Kyouko\'s assortment of ranged tricks was limited, but they were all coming in handy.

*What do you think, Elizabeth?* she asked, addressing one of her bodyguards. *You reckon we got the next wave?*

*It will be close,* the girl thought. *We barely kept this one from hitting the ships. But Nadya\'s flank is holding up, and we\'re bleeding them here.*

As if to accentuate that last point, a flurry of yellow arrows flew past Kyouko, honing in on targets somewhere in the distance.

Kyouko returned a confident grin, even as she slashed her spear downward in front of her almost heedlessly, catching a long‐range kinetic projectile mid‐flight and sending it off into the abyss. One might think what was basically a giant alien bullet fired at unfathomable speeds would be extremely visible, but it really wasn\'t---except in infrared, where it glowed white with the heat of firing.

All magical girls had an innate sense for such incoming attacks, but it was nice also being able to *see* them.

Her TacComp informed her that alien fighters had been detected making another approach. She checked the details; the ferocity of the alien attacks was beginning to flag, and the fighters were showing signs of a fixed resources shortage. If her fleet could keep this up, the aliens would have to commit their frigates to decide the fight.

That was a big if, of course.

Kyouko took a moment to concentrate, dialing in a big expenditure of magic.

It was still a bit disorienting, splitting herself into multiple copies. Unlike the simpler *Rosso Fantasma* of her youth, each of these clones brought the full Kyouko, the whole shebang, so to speak. But that meant there was no longer one true copy, and she never knew whose eyes she would end up seeing through---and she found afterward that she had the memories of each one. Even her soul gem, which otherwise could not be divided, seemed to switch back and forth between copies, perhaps explaining why her clones couldn\'t get too far apart.

She never quite got over the experience of looking at herself though, blinking back at what was now a thicket of nearly three dozen copies, each making eerily similar expressions, probably thinking the same thing she was.

*Looking good,* one of them thought, and she almost rolled her eyes.

She formed ranks into a wall formation, her clones arranging themselves into alternating rows that obstructed passage, equipped with nets and fire as well as spears.

Among the Ancients she had always been one of the fastest, and coupled with the exceptional level of coordination she could achieve with... herself, she could compensate for a lack of range. It also helped make up for the fact that she wasn\'t always the best at working with others.

Collectively, she watched the proverbial horizon, thoughts coordinated, information thrumming between implants.

She anticipated an assortment of missiles, but only a few came, easily dealt with by a wave of homing spears. It seemed the most recent attack on Raven wasn\'t a fluke---the aliens were running low on Ravagers.

That meant the fighters would have to come closer.

She---every version of her---froze still for a few seconds, settling into a diamond pattern not unlike the pattern of her own chain wall.

She watched a half‐dozen fighters barrel closer, then smiled wickedly as a barrage of arrows flew through the gaps, courtesy of the twin archers behind her. The bolts of magic whipped her hair, ignoring physics.

One of the fighters blew apart immediately, the arrows bombarding it blinking past its shields and impacting straight into the front hull. It showered the area in a spray of debris and radiation that glowed iridescent in Kyouko\'s vision even as she tracked the others.

Another took a similar impact, but didn\'t explode so gratuitously, instead spiraling off course, barely managing to turn away.

It spun off into the distance, where perhaps it might repair itself and return, or more likely, would just retreat. None of the humans could afford a risky pursuit.

A few other fighters took big hits, and Kyouko noted with satisfaction that this was as much damage as her girls had managed to inflict in the entire fight leading up to now, not counting those with Yuma\'s high‐risk teams. Close range was not doing the aliens any favors.

The aliens had of course noticed Kyouko\'s wall of clones, and they unleashed a lethal barrage of kinetic fire, waiting until they got a bit closer to follow up with lasers and, perhaps, radiation.

Perhaps they thought she would evade or break formation, giving them easier targets and time to close---clumps of clones to blast, or an isolated girl for multiple fighters to focus on.

Instead her smile grew wider as she pointed her spear forward, echoed across the formation as it thrust forward telekinetically, a wall of chains appearing in front of her to seal off the projectiles.

By now there were hundreds of her, replicating outward in an ostentatious display of magic. Nothing in front of her would live, and the aliens were still on inward trajectories.

They quickly realized the danger, and those caught in front tried to turn---but a cloud of drones and mines lined the edges, coordinated by the gestalt, and accentuated by homing arrows from the twins.

As she gained speed, she saw the overwhelming glow of the aliens detonating hard radiation bursts. Surely she made an attractive target, but she had addressed that particular weakness long, long ago, after a politically‐motivated assassination attempt. If the Ceph wanted to try, they were centuries too late.

*Not your lucky day,* she thought, homing in on her prey.

Even the most basic of magic barriers was a better buffer for radiation than one\'s own flesh, and she was a specialist in using her chains to restrict movement in combat---had to be, really, even with centuries of work on her speed. Radiation shielding had been easy to learn, once she had recovered from her injuries.

And as for using a spear against a forcefield---well, there were plenty of magical girls who could project a stronger shield than a squid fighter.

Three of her closed in on a fighter, weaving expertly in between its close‐range laser bursts. She herself got to deliver the killing blow, dragging her spear through shields, hull, and critical components in one gesture that carried her out of the shrapnel zone.

She knew she made it look easy, out here in zero gravity, but on the ground that much force would have overturned a skyscraper, and she had done it *backhand*.

Well, perhaps not *that* easy. The alien counterattack had caused her to lose her bearings briefly, and as she regained them, she spotted one of her clones nearby. More accurately, part of one.

She grimaced as the head dissolved back into the magical ether. Those memories would be unpleasant, but, well, it helped to keep her grounded.

So too did the deaths, a pair of girls who tended the rose garden of her church.

It stung, all of it stung, but they were not truly gone. Few could say that with more certainty than her. The tragedy was the life cut short, but it was not without consolation.

The other consolation was that for now her forces had survived, and even more than survived. The alien fighters were by all appearances limping away, and it wasn\'t clear if they would be coming back without frigate support.

She dismissed her clones, choosing one closer to one of her ships as her new body. As she felt her consciousness draining back into one host, she had one more thought, collectively this time, sharpened into defiance by her losses.

*You want a fight?* she thought, directed at the aliens. *Then come at me, if you dare.*

She peered out into the darkness, waiting to see if the aliens would answer the challenge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko reappeared inside yet another alien facility, only to be hit almost immediately with a sense of *déjà vu*. It was all the same: a sudden uneasy feeling beginning in the pit of her stomach, her magic incessantly warning her that she was stuck, the time until she could teleport frozen at max. The world around her was syrupy, too *tough somehow.

This time, at least, the experience wasn\'t so unexpected.

*Huh,* Azrael thought, when they were done clearing the room. Ying‐zhi had pinned one of the aliens to the floor with her barrier, and a tendril of tar‐black magic flowed from the Cephalopod\'s head into Azrael\'s outstretched hand, bubbling along its length and dribbling onto the floor.

*The aliens are* surprised *by the wormhole suppression effect,* Azrael thought. *Some of it here is natural from the mining, but most was induced remotely right after we arrived.*

*The aliens don\'t always share intel with their grunts,* Ying‐zhi thought.

*Yes, but I\'m getting the distinct sense that this isn\'t supposed to happen,* Azrael thought. *The technology is...*

She paused, the oozing magic in front of her quickening and widening. An ornamental gold ring snapped off the alien\'s forehead and hung in the air, suspended in Ying‐zhi\'s barrier.

*Forbidden somehow,* Azrael finished. *Not in the religious sense. Just, they\'re not supposed to be using it. Not against us.*

She was silent for a few seconds.

*Are you done with it, then?* Ying‐zhi thought. *Not to rush you, but we can\'t stand around waiting.*

*No, I think I\'ll keep this one for now,* Azrael thought. *It\'s magic‐expensive, but I think I got someone useful.*

Ryouko looked around the room. Aliens of various... types, she had come to think of it, lay strewn across the floor in a dozen distinct meetings with death. This wasn\'t quite where the aliens had been trying to work their science, but it was close.

And unlike with the gravity modulators, this room *did* have a viewing window, which glowed an unsettling pale white.

She couldn\'t drop her guard, even with the room ostensibly secured, and when she moved for the window Ying‐zhi and Oda followed her, just in case---and because they, too, wanted to see what was on the other side.

The angle of the window was such that without getting close enough to look *down*, all you could see was the curved ceiling of a large cavity, from which hung a number of tentacle‐like metallic tubes, reminiscent of the manipulators common with both Human and Ceph drone technology. As she walked over, she could see that they were attached to large, oval machines of some sort, which even bore strange, unreadable markings on the side, etched into the metal.

*Fascinating,* Clarisse thought. *The aliens never use their written language outside of display consoles. To see it written out like this is quite unusual.*

Ryouko nodded silently, though they both knew the machines weren\'t the main sight. The glow from the window came from something below the floating machines, something which emitted radiation throughout the spectrum in a way nothing in Clarisse\'s records matched, with no spectral lines at all.

When it first came into view, her eyes failed to truly *see* it, a soft‐edged white circle that was just *there*, with no visible texture, no connection to its surroundings, nothing that gave it away as more than two dimensional, other than simple binocular depth, like a graphical glitch in VR. She couldn\'t even be sure how far away it was.

Only as she got close to the glass did her suit sensors start to verify that, yes, some of the strange gravitational readings in the area seemed to be coming from the object, if it *was* an object.

Not all of the readings, though.

One of the machines started to move languidly, and it took a few seconds to register what was strange about its motion, and why its color seemed to shift as it progressed---its time was unstable, relative to their room.

*So? Any ideas on how to destroy this thing?* Oda thought. *I don\'t fancy trying to ride a bolt through an environment like that, and we don\'t have a black hole to just fling at it. Wish Asami didn\'t need to maintain those, we might have got one for the road.*

*We don\'t have to destroy the thing itself, only the machines around it, if I had to guess,* Ryouko thought. *An anomaly like this couldn\'t possibly be stable on its own. The real question is, do we still want to be here when it becomes unstable?*

*How far away can you get us if we need to bail?* Ying‐zhi thought, directing the question at Oda, rather than Ryouko.

*Maybe ten kilometers, it depends on how much time I get,* Oda thought, leaning onto her polearm. *And how much local conditions affect me. The paths here are not ideal, too much magnetic energy twisting every which way from the pulsar. I\'d do better in air or simple vacuum.*

She paused, making sure the others got that point. As pulsars went this one was tame, but its magnetic field density was still appreciable, even at several hundred kilometers.

*Any idea what this thing is?* Oda asked, finally.

*A topological discontinuity, a lack of space‐time,* Clarisse thought, filling in for Ryouko when she didn\'t immediately say anything. *It stands to reason, if they\'re mining out pieces of space‐time, though why they\'d keep the hole around is anyone\'s guess.*

Ryouko was as surprised as anyone at Clarisse\'s statement, but it rang true to her when she heard it. Staring at the object---if it could even be called that---she had the distinct sense it could not be teleported into, not only because she was blocked or because it was unsafe, but because there simply wasn\'t anywhere *to go*.

Still, the anomaly wasn\'t what was interfering with her teleportation.

By now, the rest of the team had started to clear the corridor outside. It was one thing to talk about destroying the machinery in front of them, quite another to do it. What was the best approach? By hand? With a PAYNE device? What knock‐on effects could result? Could they escape? These were the imponderable questions they and their TacComps had to answer, and that consumed precious time.

*Uh, is it just me, or is the wall on the other side doing something? Oda asked.

It was not just her---the side of the chamber opposite their window, past the tentacle arms of the machinery, had clearly started to change shape, visibly distorting in a way that didn\'t seem correct for what had until now seemed like a solid surface.

*I\'m not sure I want to find out what that\'s about,* Ying‐zhi thought. We should---*

Ryouko\'s combat reflexes triggered, faster than she or Clarisse could even register what the stimulus had been. Neither of the other two had reacted, and their dulled movements seemed almost stationary as Ryouko found herself shoving Oda bodily towards Ying‐zhi, then ramming both of them towards the corridor doorway with sheer force.

Deprived of her teleportation, she improvised, the arbalest on her wrist materializing and firing an achingly slow bolt at the wall next to the rounded hall entryway, trailed by a length of magical string. Another arbalest materialized on her other wrist and followed suit, all of it taking place so slowly that she could watch the magical components appear one by one.

And as she retracted the string, using her crossbows to grapple them towards the exit and rest of their team, Oda and Ying‐zhi grabbing onto her instinctively, Clarisse was finally able to register that the apparent slowness wasn\'t *all* combat reflexes---they were, in fact, slowed down significantly compared to a tidal wave of confused signals arriving from the others.

The iris door to the corridor opened with ludicrous speed, one of their melee specialists moving in and out of the threshold in a blur, backing away from the distortion zone.

Ying‐zhi\'s barrier flashed into place and its leading edge passed through the exit, smoothing out what would have been a catastrophic transition back to normal time. As the world outside the observation room started to slow down to their speed---or more accurately, as they sped up to match the world outside---Ryouko released one of her grapples, spinning so she could see behind her.

In the viewing window, the not‐object loomed enormous, closing rapidly nearer, clearly about to pass through.

*Alright, so no more niceties,* Ying‐zhi thought, as they touched ground in the corridor and quickly began retreating down its length, moving fast enough to gain some distance from the void anomaly. *Where is the key support machinery?*

*The inner walls of the chamber we saw,* Azrael thought, still dragging along her alien thrall. *We can try reaching the access hatch, or we can try cutting straight through the reinforced outer walls. The machinery is heavy in exotic matter; the cuts would have to be precise in depth.*

Ryouko sensed something at the edge of her perception, and the discussion ended abruptly as they took evasive measures. She slammed herself flat against the ground, and minute fractions of a second later, a fusillade of lasers seared through the air above her, Ying‐zhi\'s emergency barrier catching a fraction of them just a tiny bit late.

*Great timing,* Ying‐zhi thought, as they assessed the group of alien infantry deploying at the far end of the corridor, in the direction they had been trying to run from the ominous, oncoming white disc.

Muted telepathic cursing came through a moment later and Ying‐zhi was at Azrael\'s side in a flash.

The combat readouts made the story clear---distracted by the concentration of maintaining a thrall, Azrael hadn\'t dodged fast enough, and a laser had clipped her on the side of her neck, severing a major artery. It had sealed itself almost immediately, but the smell of blood started to fill Ryouko\'s nose, before Clarisse tuned it away.

Ryouko doublechecked her surroundings. The circular corridor provided no side passages, no viewing panels, and no sign of the display walls that were ubiquitous in human facilities and not uncommon in squid facilities. Instead it was just... one long walkway, with alien infantry already entrenched in front, and the white void approaching behind.

She pushed herself up off the sand‐textured floor, joining the others with ranged weapons in suppressing fire. She lobbed a triplet of exploding bolts with one arm, spinning herself into a crouch. As she did so, she spotted the alien Azrael had mind‐controlled dead on the ground, some suicide implant having seized its opportunity.

Pinned, the strain of combat focused their minds. Azrael\'s telepathic input indicated that the force of aliens before them was substantial and in‐depth, presumably loaded with the kinds of tricks that attrited magical girls---swarming attacks, high explosives, too much firepower to dodge. They might take losses if they tried to move forward, and for a team dependent on synergy, a couple losses could easily cascade into complete disaster---a lesson mission simulations never let you forget.

At the same time, though, they couldn\'t stay still. The space‐time distortions contorting the corridor would reach them very soon.

They kept up their fire on the aliens, secure behind Ying‐zhi\'s shield, relying on the fact that *their* projectiles---homing, explosive, piercing---were superior. Azrael stood back up, part of her neck an apparition of Ying‐zhi\'s magic, glowing golden. She reached across the gap, freezing muscles, sensory organs, and minds in place with a piercing ooze that rose out of the floor.

And as the white disc behind them moved inexorably up the corridor, their melee specialists turned on the wall next to them, carving into it with ax‐hammer, spear, and sword with an implausible level of efficacy. Once a sharply‐defined block had been excavated, Oda touched it, teleporting it directly behind the shield barricade the aliens had tried to set up, right on top of the generator.

That was not the main point, of course. Alien equipment now lay partially exposed, tubes and wire and alloy, filled to the brim with exotic matter. There was no need to speculate what would happen if they destroyed it.

*Gather around me,* Oda thought, as the girl with the sword readied one, last destructive slash, outlined in a disquieting white.

This time, when they teleported out, Ryouko could directly perceive that Oda\'s teleportation wasn\'t at the speed of light; she could tell without looking that they were being chased by a tremendously destructive explosion, heavily dosed with spatio‐temporal effects. She could even tell what Oda had meant about magnetic energy density---they were clearly straining against *something* to move.

The journey was tight---length and time convulsed at their heels, far beyond the radius their TacComps had estimated, following them even into the depths of space, and it began to seem inevitable that the rising maelstrom would overtake them.

It was hard to even feel fear under the circumstances.

Then they finally found respite within another shielded mining station and reemerged back into real space, Oda dropping to one knee as her soul gem recharged.

The others raised their barriers and began prophylactically clearing the area, but quickly stopped---it was empty of hostiles, and they had destroyed what appeared to be several drone maintenance hubs.

They relaxed, slightly. It would be at least possible to catch a breath here. Alien work on the ad hoc blink cannon must have been set back temporarily. And since Oda had been forced to target a location more or less randomly, there was no intel or detailed plan beyond that.

Work drones scurried away from them in alarm, making it clear that this outpost in the Ceph\'s archipelagic mining infrastructure didn\'t even have automated defenses. Suit sensors and magic indicated no local "topological discontinuities\" either, probably not a coincidence.

Still, the station rumbled around them, gravitational echoes of their earlier work, and most of the girls carefully surveyed their surroundings---drab nanocomposite walls, low ceilings, rows of drone hubs, and almost no lighting.

Ryouko, though, was focused on something else.

She still could not teleport---the effect was following her, she was certain now---but, by some fluke of magic or luck, they were nearly atop that problem\'s source, probably less than two hundred meters away. Not in this drone nexus, but it might very well be in the opposite half of the room below.

*I know it\'s not our main priority,* she thought, forwarding this information. *But if we could take it out, then I could teleport again, and we could be a lot safer.*

*Also, if I may point this out, any device that\'s capable of blocking wormhole formation is worth at least a passing glance,* Clarisse thought. *It might be valuable technology.*

With Oda still recuperating from the emergency teleport, the gestalt finally acceded to Ryouko\'s request, which now fit neatly within MagOps doctrine---once you were loud, you had to stay loud. No sense in loitering when the enemy knew both your location and much of your power lineup, and nothing else nearby offered higher prospects as an interim target---they had plenty of essential mining infrastructure left to destroy, but not nearby.

Without teleportation, though, the exact approach here mattered. Using the hallways risked another pincer trap, among other dangers, and was simply slower; far better to cut directly through the floor.

When they dropped down, accelerating sideways midair to confuse any defenders, it was to a silent reception---the few short seconds since the teleport had been enough for the Ceph to react. In the midst of what appeared to be an automated fabrication facility lay a circle of dead bodies, rapidly cooling in Ryouko\'s infrared vision, surrounding a piece of equipment destroyed by explosive charges. *Pieces* of equipment, actually; if the forensic reconstruction maps made by their TacComps were accurate, there seemed to be two.

Ryouko had felt it early, and with a pleasure tempered by the loss of intact tech---as well as the fact she hadn\'t gotten to personally blow it to smithereens---she teleported Ying‐zhi, Azrael, and their healer from the air directly to the fallen aliens.

The latter two dashed into action upon arrival, the healer crouching next to the most ornamented of the aliens to place her hand on its head. Magic could not ordinarily revive even the recently‐dead, but that wasn\'t the intent here---the Cephalopods routinely melted their core neural tissues as part of their suicide routines, and so the goal was merely to patch enough circuits together for a telepath to profitably despoil.

As the team worked, Ryouko examined the bodies, which were noticeably different even at first glance. All of them wore richly embellished tunics, stiffer than the fluid robes she had seen earlier, and on closer inspection all of them had copper‐green external implants connected to the base of the cranial shell, with cables running down the dorsal spine, altogether the size of a small backpack. These, too, lay broken on the ground, like so many eggshells.

*We\'re discovering new aliens all the time, I guess,* someone thought, in what was probably meant as a vague joke. No one laughed.

*That\'s strange,* the healer thought. *This primary nerve center is far more intact than I\'d expect.*

*I\'ll take luck where I can get it,* Azrael thought. *Or it might not be luck, given the look of these ones.*

She extended a tendril of her magic, the black ooze merging with the bright blue of the healer\'s magic to envelop the alien\'s head.

*Suicide implants triggered right when we arrived, as might be expected,* Azrael thought, before loading the telepathic channel with a deliberately meaningful silence.

*Oh, that\'s odd,* she thought. *They\'re not supposed to be here. One of the two devices here was a stealth device. They were hiding from the aliens on the station too.*

There was a beat while the gestalt processed this rather confusing bit of information. Sabotage? The lackeys being left out of the loop once again? The aliens here did look rather important...

They weren\'t given much time to ponder the issue, as the main doors into the room slid open and a barrage of weapons fire and bone‐rattling explosions rang out from an assortment of assault drones, sending some of them diving instinctively for cover. Their barriers held back any real damage, and most of the drones were picked off immediately, but they\'d served their purpose, buying time for more heavily‐armored infantry to dart in, taking their own cover behind the tall banks of autofabricators.

Only Azrael didn\'t react, seemingly lost in her thoughts, and otherwise safe behind Ying‐zhi\'s barrier. Her magic flickered ichor‐green for a tenth of a second, something seeming to sneak its way *up* the stream of her tendril.

Azrael failed to update them, or respond to a fast emergency ping, prompting the healer to lunge over and pull her physically down, even as the others engaged the alien infantry.

*I\'ve never found anything like this,* Azrael thought, finally, shocked. *I\'ve never found anything like this, not from a* squid. It\'s...*

Her spoken thought trailed off, but her transmissions filled out the rest. It resembled a structured information packet, a *telepathic* one, of the kind that members of the Telepaths\' Guild sometimes experimented with. What was it doing coming out of a non‐magical, non‐human corpse?

Moreover, and perhaps just as troubling, Azrael couldn\'t parse it.

*Maybe you all should take a look,* Azrael thought. *I can relay it.*

There was a long pause before anyone had a chance to look, as most of the group engaged the aliens. Ryouko had found an alcove in a far bend of the room to crouch in, and she leveled a series of shots past a group of unidentified machines, using a mixed bag of arrow types to keep her enemies from adapting. A few flew straight, piercing a camera drone trying to dive forward. A few others rounded the corner, expending themselves on alien shielding with satisfying, loud pops. One picked an incoming grenade out of the air, slapping it back to its sender.

Whatever satisfaction she might have bled from the achievement was short‐lived, however, as an Adamantium‐class alien trooper smashed through the machines near her with full shields, a massive assemblage of green‐black armor and grey‐black alloy cannon and white‐blue shield sparks intent on pummeling her with sheer momentum even if she killed it.

Silly to try that against a teleporter, she thought, tensing for a teleport‐assisted backstab---but that proved frustratingly unnecessary when Oda\'s lightning snapped into the alien\'s side with impossible momentum, sending it crashing into the sidewall with an explosive crunch. The lightning materialized as girl and spear a moment later, neatly bisecting the cannon.

Ryouko shook her head, adjusting her hearing again after all that noise, but it was just as well that Oda had intervened, because Ryouko then decided to examine Azrael\'s transmission.

The packet burst into her mind with a mishmash of images and knowledge*, a reverie filled with technical diagrams and winding, looping symbols she somehow *understood*, an ice bath of data that almost triggered an involuntary gasp from the sheer overload.

Clarisse seized control of Ryouko\'s body and moved her further from the fight, signaling to the team that she needed cover, without explaining why.

Ryouko reeled under the onslaught, boggled by the implications of the fact that *she could read it,* not that the information in the packet wasn\'t itself stunning. The second destroyed device had been a *blink interdictor*, a countermeasure to blink cannons and paradox drives. They had never been deployed against humans before because there were no equivalent human technologies to counter.

By now, the others had noticed Ryouko\'s lack of response, or even responsiveness, her presence on the telepathic link the equivalent of empty static, her combat interface devoid of all but Clarisse\'s most cursory data feeds. The healer was moving to check her status when Clarisse finally gave them an update.

*I can\'t think through it all yet myself,* Clarisse thought to Ryouko, issuing a dense datagram to the network. *There are too many variables. Too many things going on. But I can make a guess as to why a blink interdictor would affect you---their teleportation might work in a way similar to yours. It would make sense.*

*This is crazy,* one of the other girls thought---or, more accurately, shouted, busy deflecting bullets with a scimitar. *Have you always been able to do this?*

*I\'m not even a telepath!* Ryouko thought.

*Can we arrange a pick‐up of all this?* Ying‐zhi thought, addressing the distant fleet gestalt, which had already begun a painful cost‐benefit analysis. Blink interdiction would change the face of the war---but mission resources were overstretched to the point of snapping, and reverse engineering even *intact* Cephalopod contraptions was typically an endless nightmare.

As an added burden, if they intended to claim what remained of the equipment, they\'d have to defend it, or else carry it with them as they moved. It hadn\'t taken the aliens long to start lobbing explosives at the material; it was possible that was even their main goal here. Heavier weapons might not be far behind.

And on top of *all of that*, Clarisse had still more to add, doing the mental equivalent of tapping Ryouko on the shoulder.

*I know this is a bad time,* she thought, gently, *but I think this is important for you to know.*

*What is it?* Ryouko asked, pouring every drop of her military and MSY emotional training into a placid acceptance of her TacComp\'s emotional and biological fiddling. On Clarisse\'s advice, she distracted herself by firing several barrages of homing bolts upward, hitting two Ceph in the rear of the clamorous battle.

*I\'ll keep it as short as I can,* Clarisse thought. *While you were deciphering that telepathic packet, I saw a huge spike in activity from the module inside your brain. Near as I can tell, the data was all being processed there, and I detected the release of a few compounds I suspect to be novel neuromodulators.*

Ryouko had no idea what to do with information like that, at a time like this.

*I know,* Clarisse thought. *It\'s not something I would* want *to talk about right now, except it might be important for the mission and your performance. Only the commanding officers were ever even briefed on the genetic engineering done to you. I haven\'t told anyone about this.*

*Well, they already know,* Azrael thought.

The two of them jerked in surprise, before Ryouko\'s combat instincts dampened her physical reaction and kept her on task.

*Sorry, it\'s my job to monitor you,* Azrael thought. *Especially after your previous feat with the packet. I am the team telepath, after all.*

*We\'ll discuss this later,* Ying‐zhi thought. *We can\'t stay here. It won\'t stay secure, and Command is sending a recovery team for the goods.*

With the room mostly clear, at least momentarily, Ying‐zhi manifested another barrier, enclosing the vital equipment and bodies into a shimmering golden bubble, dragging it all along the finely grained white and grey flooring, sealing them up for transport.

As she worked, the team moved into teleport formation around Oda---saving Ryouko for a potential emergency follow‐up teleport---and departed, leaving behind still‐firing Ceph amid a landscape of charred and ruined fabricators. They would head for a new mining station, with as few hostiles as possible, and try to buy some time for the recovery team.

Based on a snippet of Azrael\'s clairvoyance, they were able to land in a narrow storage area. It would have to do for now; they set up a perimeter, Ryouko proceeding through the standard procedure mechanically.

*What do you think? Is she alright?* Ying‐zhi thought immediately on arrival, making sure only Azrael and Ryouko received the thought.

Those questions carried other questions within them, like: \"Can she still perform? Can she be trusted?\"

*I think so,* Azrael thought. *A magical girl can\'t be suborned like that. I trust her. But I can\'t...*

The way Azrael\'s voice trailed off spoke volumes, and Ryouko herself leaned heavily against their healer, hidden from most of the team by a stack of alien‐sized helmets.

Now that Ryouko was looking, she could detect Azrael\'s mental intrusion, maybe even clamp down on it. But why? Didn\'t she want Azrael watching, in case whatever was in her brain did anything else?

Azrael dropped by her side, grabbing her arm to gain her attention.

She looked up at Ryouko.

*I\'m not trusting you just because of the mind‐reading, or because you\'re a magical girl,* Azrael thought. *I\'m trusting you because I know you, and I know what you\'re made of, and I know that we\'ll be there to save you if something happens. If we can\'t have confidence in that, then we\'re lost anyway.*

Ryouko *wanted* to believe that. She wanted to believe that her friends and comrades would support her, that her magic would protect her, that she would and *should* be trusted, because she was still Ryouko, and was not---not something else. It would even be *good* to believe that, at least for now, rather than let her mind remain choked in unresolvable fear.

But she couldn\'t believe it. Azrael and Clarisse could maybe believe it for her, and that would help a little, but no more.

Asami, maybe, could make her feel better. But the damn squid---

*---are right outside the doorway,* Clarisse thought, referencing Ying‐zhi\'s frantic signals. *You need to focus, girl.*

Ryouko tried to, and followed the hurried decision of the team leaders. They had two options: flee again, and make it more difficult for the recovery team to reach them, or stay and fight.

They chose to fight, which suited Ryouko just fine, and this time, before the doors even opened, Ryouko had teleported half her team to a room across the hall, already firing. Bolts and beams shimmered through the walls and into the aliens from both sides as they blasted through the original doorway and tried to pour in.

Before either side could do anything more, though, the Ceph were swallowed by a burst of searing scarlet light, bright enough even behind fully opaque composite that Ryouko glanced aside to protect her eyes and optical sensors.

Three magical girls appeared then in the doorway, blowing off a puff of smoke. Stealth magic, Ryouko belatedly realized.

*Thought you could use a little help,* Patricia von Rohr thought, as the teams united amid a passage strewn with ichor and chunks of squid. We\'re the pick‐up crew.*

Three girls was decidedly below the standard team size, and Ryouko struggled to maintain her composure as she reviewed why: Patricia\'s team had taken half‐casualties, losing two girls and a body to the same kind of white void that had nearly trapped her team earlier.

For all that, she couldn\'t see any of it on their faces.

Patricia\'s stealth generator and teleporter, Mina Guyure, claimed the goods from Ying‐zhi. The two Orpheus veterans knew each other\'s powers well, and Mina had little trouble grasping Ying‐zhi\'s bubble and vanishing it with a gesture, teleporting it to the safety of a ship. Ryouko couldn\'t help but feel a little jealous---teleporting items without teleporting *yourself* too could be dead‐effective in combat.

As Mina prepared to go, though, leaving Patricia behind as a new member of Ryouko\'s team, the fleet gestalt sent a rare explicit directive.

〈*Enemy reinforcements are arriving in outer orbit, and remaining gravity modulators cannot be destroyed in time. All orders will be reconfigured for full assault on mines proper to stabilize the wormhole and delay blink cannon construction. When the wormhole is traversable, immediately abort.*〉

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They were losing.

The conclusion was unavoidable now, as Maki watched one of Kyouko\'s clones strip the soul gem from yet another of her fellow magical girls.

Maki tried not to think about what the girl\'s radiation‐ravaged body looked like.

She couldn\'t help but feel frustrated. She knew that with her decoy ships, missiles, and magical girls she was arguably doing more than most of the girls here, but that was a scant glory when Yuma\'s squad was already on their third stolen frigate. Whatever she was doing, it wasn\'t enough*.

Maki took a moment to get a grip on her emotions, waving aside a suggestion by her TacComp for emotional suppression.

She was fine, she thought. She lacked Kyouko\'s experience, but she had the same training as everyone else. The bad news had simply stacked up---the aliens had more hard radiation bombs than normal, the MSY paramilitary ships melted under Sarissa lasers like summer ice, the squid had learned to instantly surround any frigate Yuma approached...

Most galling, part of the problem was that the younger magical girls simply hadn\'t performed as expected---including herself. There had been reasons they weren\'t on the front lines.

She contained her rage, twisting on one of her dual swords with force that would have wrung a mammoth\'s neck.

Their chances were very poor now, and the gestalt couldn\'t come up with a better plan than stalling until, maybe, the aliens just quit, either for lack of fuel or the nearing human reinforcements. Yenisei lay between Cephalopod space and the battle, so if the aliens wanted to escape they would need to give its forces a wide berth.

*Status?* Kyouko asked the gestalt, the message echoed by her phalanx of clones.

*Still twenty minutes out,* Kana thought. *Not soon enough. We\'ve been promised an advance wave of Ascalon missiles, but...*

There was no need to finish the thought.

Maki cringed as a focused barrage of lasers flashed toward Kyouko\'s position. Forewarned by Charlotte, Maki was able to summon a giant black sheet facing that general direction, and some drones from a commandeered ship were able to zip into position---

---but it wasn\'t quite enough, as she watched Kyouko lose another of her clones.

It was just a clone, but Maki knew on several grounds that they were realer than Kyouko ever let on. At some level, Kyouko remembered those deaths, even if she was good at screening it out.

Perhaps more importantly right now, clones were expensive for Kyouko to make, and a grief cube shortage was not a weight they could bear.

She watched---*admired* was perhaps more accurate---as Kyouko weaved her way out of a few more blasts, though her admiration was dimmed by the realization that Kyouko had been protected by a point‐defense blast from Yuma\'s alien frigate.

The stellar performance of the commandeered ship was almost mocking, an active reminder of just how outmatched they had been. Why were the alien ships so good?

Sensing that Kyouko needed help, Maki sent her ship apparition towards her, giving her a seemingly solid object that could screen an escape. Kyouko noticed immediately, and a good number of her clones pushed themselves onto the safe side of the ship to regroup.

They emerged on the other side of the ship a renewed force, showing no hesitation about going back in.

*If it\'s the Goddess\'s will I die here, then so be it, but I\'m going to get you all back home!* Kyouko shouted.

Maki couldn\'t watch, though, as she found herself hunted by a pack of alien missiles, of which the damn squid frigates had an apparently bottomless supply, even though their fighters were out. Deprived of their original target, someone on the alien side had found the time to manually retarget them around Maki\'s ghost ship.

She summoned a platform of paint beneath her, turning it into a small rocket as she managed her evasion, letting concentration on her decoy ship slip a little---

Her world spiraled out of focus briefly, as *something* struck her side, and she instinctively detached herself from the pain, losing control of herself for a long moment.

Four point four seconds, to be exact, when she resynchronized, finding one of Kyouko\'s clones holding onto her. She had abandoned her position to come back for Maki.

*I\'m... fine,* Maki thought, and she meant it, assessing the damage, her abdomen in tatters from the shrapnel of a close‐detonating missile.

Kyouko looked skeptical, but a flash of green arrived before she could say anything, flung into place by Nadya\'s unmatched telekinesis.

*She\'ll be fine,* Yuma thought. *I\'ll heal her. Go!*

Kyouko\'s clone hesitated for a moment, then turned and flew away.

Maki was glad.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuma distracted herself from her anger by focusing on her healing.

*That idiot!* she thought. She had *told* Kyouko not to get herself killed, and here Kyouko was, cut to pieces left and right, charging into battle yelling things about her Goddess, getting distracted by her girlfr---

*Yuma,* Kana thought.

*What is it?* Yuma asked, making an effort to keep her emotions from leaking in.

*The alien bombers aren\'t gone. I\'ve been searching the area around us and I saw a past‐vision of them refueling and rearming with Raptors at a cloaked supply ship. I\'m informing the gestalt in half a second, and I need you to have a response plan ready. The younger girls don\'t need the chance to panic.*

> That is not to say that we know *nothing* about them. Despite what appears to be the aliens\' best attempts to prevent thorough observation of their use---extending even to an apparent reluctance to use them for tactical jumps---we have plenty of empirical data about their practical capabilities and limitations.

> The standard alien \"blink\" teleport consists of three phases: the "charge‐up\" period, the blink itself, and the post‐blink "malaise\". For practical purposes, the blink itself is nearly instantaneous and not worth much discussion.
>
> The charge‐up period involves pouring large amounts of power into the paradox drive over an extended period of time, from a few minutes for a short jump to hours for a long one. Statistical observation suggests that this is not just a matter of power generation, since ships of similar size take an almost invariable amount of time to travel similar distances, regardless of their apparent power supply.
>
> Then follows the post‐blink malaise, the apparent inability of alien ships to use FTL engines after completing a blink, even for mere sublight acceleration. Malaise lasts for about as long as the corresponding charge‐up period, sometimes slightly less. It is not known what causes this---and as it is obviously a huge tactical liability, presumably the Cephalopods have been unable to get rid of it.

> There are two additional properties of blink that strongly influence its strategic usage. The first is an apparent sensitivity to the local curvature of space‐time; most observed blink transits connect points far outside a stellar gravity well.
>
> The second is the paradox drive\'s maximal range, seemingly just over twenty light‐years. This is long enough that the border with alien‐held space is porous and heavily contested, but short enough that no alien offensive has yet endangered multiple Core Worlds, or even come close to endangering Earth, which hasn\'t been under direct threat since the first few weeks of the Contact War.

> Finally, and closely related, there is the alien Blink Bombardment Cannon, which likely leverages a paradox drive analog to teleport its projectiles. Unlike a regular blink, in which a paradox drive moves itself, a blink cannon moves only its munitions.

> This latter mode of teleportation seems more difficult: the distances involved are much shorter, with comparatively longer charge‐up periods. The resulting malaise is also weaker, making it a poor weapon for FTL interdiction. Despite these drawbacks, however, blink bombardment on a Human fleet remains devastating; a teleported nuclear or antimatter weapon is difficult to stop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuma wasn\'t ready for this.

A Ceph supply cruiser full of new Raptor missiles was a scenario that was so obviously disastrous, it was hardly even worth preparing for.

But, here she was.

Most---over sixty‐three percent---of Yuma\'s primary consciousness was in the dwindling Command Gestalt, where it *had* to stay, contributing her part to the life‐and‐death work of recalculating battle plans, correlating sensor data, and coordinating assets.

The rest, however, could be repurposed.

Twenty‐seven percent of Yuma had been performing combat motor functions, split between healing Maki, repairing three nearby drones, and throwing a filigreed mace at a distant homing mine.

About seven percent of Yuma had been fleshing out an attack plan against a particularly vexing alien fighter, which involved shepherding groups of suicide drones for a daring feint.

Exactly two percent of Yuma had been busy agonizing over Kyouko‐nee‐chan\'s recklessness, alongside handling telepathic exchanges with Kana, Rose, and Rin.

All those resources were reclaimed. The attack plan was canceled, and she asked the half‐healed Maki to protect her. Reacting adroitly to this role reversal, Maki began creating body doubles, sheathed in a coat of magical paint that camouflaged them against the stars.

They needed a plan, they needed *hope*, and Yuma would try to use her perspective, her memories, and her knowledge of magic to make both.

She could hardly call herself *Governance: Magical Girls* if she failed to do that, could she?

Yuma stretched out subjective time to her combat limits and beyond, pushing her custom implants into overdrive. It took its toll on her central nervous system, burning through neurons and incoordinating brain regions in a way that would have been unacceptable in a baseline human, or even a magical girl who couldn\'t rapidly reverse the damage.

The fervid sensation grew overwhelming, everywhere at once, until her TacComp severed the direct connection to her physical senses and took control of her body, leaving Yuma---or rather, thirty‐six percent of Yuma---alone to her thoughts.

Alone, but not in the dark. Far from it. She had only done this rarely before, but that was enough to understand that while she was here she would see, she would hear, she would *experience* in a way that was impossible to explain to anyone else, in the same way that no AI could explain their subjective experience to a human.

But allegory helped, and even her own mind was forced to rely upon it partially.

She found herself surrounded by a vast pool of data, rippling under an unseen sun. The surface frothed and boiled violently, as if animated by some unseen storm, and yet never touched the tiny, one‐person patch of sand she was standing on. Around her, other copies of her stood on their own islands. They looked at each other, then at the water below, where ideas and experiences slipped in and out of her awareness as so many fish, displaying their scales for gleaming moments before vanishing below the cognitive tide.

She dove in.

The first few catches were small, slipping into her hands almost by accident. If the alien bombers were truly on their way back with more Raptors, there was only one thing to do---move their magical girls to where they were most likely to survive, and absorb whatever losses they could elsewhere. Their magic simply couldn\'t protect all their ships across so large a space.

But beyond that...

The alien bombers might be targeting the reinforcements from Yenisei, rather than them? No, that didn\'t make sense---there was no reason to do that when they could just eliminate their target right away. It was wishful thinking at best.

Yuma\'s lungs burned as she swam deeper.

Another catch: Yuma knew more Raptors were coming, but the aliens here didn\'t*---they had been mind‐read too much for it to be otherwise. She could make them pay for that operational security. Kyouko\'s ships, the ones that would likely be lost anyway, now had a small window to make very risky attacks, attacks the aliens wouldn\'t know to expect. Then, when the bombers arrived, their erstwhile escorts would already be tied up.

That was better, but it still didn\'t really give them a way to survive after* the aliens shattered Kyouko\'s fleet.

The weight of water above Yuma grew more and more oppressive, until it began pouring in through her mouth and nose. The reinforcements were too far away for even a stolen alien fighter to reach in time; stealth sufficient to escape couldn\'t be maintained against this quantity of dust and drones; there was no way they could survive long enough to charge a blink to their reinforcements with stolen alien ships---

She was shocked out of her laments by the splash of water on her face, and the crash of something plunging through the water. She opened her eyes to sunlight. When had she surfaced?

Yuma watched Kyouko pull her spear out of the water, dappled by the forest shade. They were walking along a stream, on a trip to the countryside, long ago, and Kyouko had decided she was hungry enough to try her hand at fishing.

\"Nee‐chan!\" Yuma yelled in confused anger, before diving again into the water.

The wide blade of Kyouko\'s spear could never have actually picked up anything. All it could do---had done---was slice a poor minnow nearly in half.

Yuma surfaced with the writhing creature a second later, blood spilling, and applied a burst of healing magic. It didn\'t deserve this.

She knew what would happen now. The fish would jump back in the stream, and Kyouko would scold her for wasting magic on something so frivolous as the life of an animal.

Instead, Kyouko looked her in the eye, and Yuma remembered where she was.

\"Look again,\" Kyouko said.

The fish was an unformed idea, detritus from the gestalt: a bitter thought from Captain Vera, before the loss of *HSS Raven*, of detonating her ship\'s exotic matter in a suicidal attempt at hindering alien maneuverability.

It seemed nearly irrelevant, but something about the concept had hooked into her thoughts, had caused her instincts to fish it out of the water. As Kyouko stared at her, face fading out of view, she focused her attention...

A starship\'s core was a terrible tool for FTL interdiction---cores were designed to *not* detonate, and even when they did, it was trivial to just... fly around the disrupted area. SHERMAN rounds---precisely engineered for maximum gravitational havoc, and accelerated along the spine of an entire battlecruiser---they were not.

But, having considered the topic, there *was* a major source of exotic matter nearby, and it wasn\'t trapped in cores: the alien resupply cruiser, with fuel and weapons enough for a small fleet. Relying on its stealth, the ship had brought no dedicated escort, and even lay near a plausible retreat course towards Yenisei.

That observation began forming the kernel of a plan. A pauper\'s plan, one pocked with holes Yuma didn\'t know how to patch, but something. Good enough for hope, at least.

She was out of time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuma let herself return to the real world then, her vision coming back into focus as the magic coursing through her brain brought it back to full functionality.

In a testament to the severity of their situation, the gestalt adopted the framework of her plan after just five seconds\' deliberation. That it leaned heavily on uncontrolled variables and luck, on best guesses and optimistic performance projections, was immaterial---no better alternative could be found, even if Yuma didn\'t like it. *Something had to be done quickly, if they were to have any chance at survival.

The gestalt wove together details as best it could: ship deployment charts for the pre‐bombing diversions, blink range calculations for reaching the alien cruiser afterward, team compositions for boarding and defense, and final magic compatibility consultations, for turning seized exotic matter into the FTL interdiction they would need to escape. Precalculation was essential: there likely wouldn\'t be a gestalt for such work after the bombers returned.

However desperate their situation, though, just having that set of calculations, that *plan* seemed to be enough for the younger magical girls, who buzzed with desperate hope as they began putting new orders into action. Yuma wasn\'t even sure Kana had been right to worry about their confidence---there were no new girls under emotional suppression.

They were putting too much faith in their elders, Yuma decided. They believed her and Kyouko and the other Ancients, rather than the objectively abysmal odds.

But if it kept them fighting...

*That\'s not a bad plan,* Maki thought, flying beside her. *If we can get to the supply cruiser, then we can hoist them with their own petards. It\'s worth a shot, at least. I\'m impressed you thought of it.*

*Don\'t be impressed yet,* Yuma thought.

Yuma had Maki grab onto her, arms around her waist, so that her hammer could pull them forward through the void with the kind of speed only an Ancient could muster.

The human flotilla had organized itself into a defensive sphere, a mutually‐supporting crust of ships and drones and materiel crushed in the grip of the larger alien force, the entire assemblage moving towards Yenisei and its reinforcements. Now they rearranged themselves within that vice, in a deceptive choreography of drone, starship, and magical girl that redirected valuable personnel and ships away from the predicted direction of the bombers, while less vital assets moved to replace them.

The most protected human ships, those which held the center of the running fight, were ironically not human at all: an alien fighter seized by Jeannette, an alien frigate manned by mind‐controlled squid under Charlotte, and another alien frigate transformed by Rose‐Merline, who had reluctantly sent her living hunk of asteroid to be sacrificed.

Alien ships were the only ones that could blink to the cruiser, after all.

Yuma and Maki could only see glimpses of the dance, the barely perceptible exhaust of nearby ships and drones, sparkling in the infinite night, accompanied by the staccato flash of weapons fire and missile detonation, like white paint flicked across a black canvas.

*Pretty, isn\'t it?* Maki thought. *In any other context, I\'d stop to watch.*

Yuma didn\'t think it was pretty. The surface couldn\'t make up for the substance, in her view.

Still, she watched it too, through the optical surface of her helmet. It was novel, at least.

They were some of the first magical girls to arrive at their new positions, along with some of the other Ancients. They arranged themselves defensively around the alien ships, with more physical mages like Nadya farther out, and finesse‐based girls like Maki closer in.

As Maki gave her cover to heal Jeannette\'s fighter, Yuma found herself sorting through a barrage of news, most of it bad.

First, there was a clairvoyant sighting of the incoming bombers, only a couple minutes out.

Second, she experienced, through the gestalt, the beginning of the sacrificial breakout attempt by their outer ships. The bombers\' attack vector had been correctly predicted beforehand, but to little avail: the attack was failing to meaningfully distract or damage the alien ships.

Third, there was news from home. Now that Yuma\'s cover had been blown, MG and Nova had triggered a preemptive tidal wave of TCF repair, trying to get ahead of anything the other conspiracy might attempt---and they had attempted a lot. Nothing as bad as Yuma had feared, but enough to cause a disaster for Yuma and Governance PR.

More importantly, the reinforcements from Yenisei had been delayed. Screening the armada for compromised AIs had triggered a full‐blown internal firefight, corrupted drones and weaponry turning on their erstwhile allies and inflicting considerable damage.

They were back underway, at least.

Finally, she had dared to peek at Vlasta\'s status. To her surprise, she was alive, if in fugue and unstable condition. More predictably, most of Raven\'s crew was dying or already dead, the latter including Captain Vera.

It felt deeply wrong, knowing she would save more lives fighting out in space than by rushing inside Rose\'s ship to follow her calling, as a healer.

Kyouko was right---she didn\'t belong out here. She missed Earth, both its trees and rivers, and its vast, endlessly deep maze of servers. She was sorry she had come out here, sorry that everything she was working on was at the mercy of an impossible battle.

She let that regret pass through her, then steeled herself for what was to come.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It hurt Kyouko, on a level she couldn\'t quite explain, to just *float there.

It was one thing to lose a fight, another to have your life be in imminent danger, and yet another to know others were dying in your name. In her long life, she had done all those things, enough to even get used to it.

But she had never done all of those at the same time, never had to just watch* as more damaged, less‐necessary ships moved towards the bombers, certain of their fate. It was noble, even heroic, and Kyouko could do nothing*.

It inspired feelings of---what? Gratitude? Inadequacy? Despair at how empty it all seemed? All the emotion in the world did nothing at all right now.

An ironic thought for a magical girl.

*Yuma thinks we\'re all going to die, Kyouko‐chan.* Please *tell me she\'s always like that.*

Kyouko grimaced at Maki\'s message.

*She doesn\'t think that. Not quite,* Kyouko thought. *I know her. She thinks we have exactly as much a chance to survive as the computers estimate. Which is not high, I know.*

*Don\'t give me that! You know that means the same damn thing! Both of you are being way too cold about all this. It\'s* not *okay if you die out here! Both of you are acting like it is.*

Kyouko started to protest, saying she had been trying *plenty* hard not to die out here, but she realized that wasn\'t entirely true. She had been throwing herself into combat with a mixture of panache and fatalism, the kind of sublime acceptance of one\'s fate that made combat easy.

*I don\'t know what to say to that,* she thought. *I\'ll try harder. That\'s all I can promise.*

Kyouko felt Maki\'s angry stare, knowing it only hid a core of fear. Fear for Kyouko, fear for herself---the kind of fear Kyouko had long ago buried into an unreachable part of her heart.

She cast her gaze out at the assembly of magical girls circling with her around the alien ships. Right now it was difficult not to imagine how vulnerable they were to a cluster of Raptor missiles. Or hard radiation bombs. Or anything, really.

It was absurd, trying to second‐guess Yuma while bombers were bearing down on them, but Kyouko *needed* to think. If she had anything real to contribute to their survival scheme, she needed to come up with it. Just as Yuma had.

Yuma\'s plan had serious weaknesses. For one thing, it relied on completing a blink with stolen alien ships, which had never been done before, even if Rin claimed to be certain they could pull it off.

Far worse was the question of seizing the alien supply cruiser. The problem was two‐fold: first, it relied on the cruiser remaining complacent as the human ships tried to blink. If the cruiser simply moved out of range, paranoid about an incoming human gambit, their whole idea was shot.

Moreover, there was a critical window, right after they blinked next to the cruiser, but before they seized total control, where the cruiser had too many dangerous options. It could attempt to self‐destruct, for example, or it could try to split the human forces, accelerating away while their ships were stuck in blink malaise. It might even blast their ships to pieces, depending on its armament.

None of these perils were singularly fatal to the plan, but cumulatively, they were pretty damn close.

Ideally, they would be able to disable the cruiser ahead of time, in a way that wouldn\'t be detected until it was too late. Right now, though, none of them could even *get there* ahead of time. One obvious idea was to exploit the returning alien bombers and sneak something aboard---some magical girls, perhaps, and Rose had even suggested incorporeal bombs during the fevered plan detailing.

But they needed the cruiser\'s exotic matter intact, which meant that bombs were too unreliable---and combustible---for the job. They simply didn\'t have the right magical stealth to hide a significant mass for very long---the odds were better to jump the cruiser with everybody all at once.

Nor had consulting an earthbound computing cluster---IIC bandwidth‐limited as that was---generated any better ideas.

Kyouko began to circle their remaining magical girls, draining her magic to prepare clones. They were now few enough, and close enough, that she would be able to put a body of hers beside almost everyone.

She could see the others making their own preparations, magic lighting up every part of the spectrum, in dozens of shapes and sizes.

It was frustrating. Even if they *could* sneak someone to the cruiser, they needed someone who could disable the ship as a whole, just for a while. Yuma didn\'t have enough scope, and Jeannette couldn\'t fully suborn such a powerful, distributed AI. There just weren\'t very many magics that operated on that scale. Even a demon miasma wouldn\'t reliably cover a full cruiser\'s volume.

Though---could it be that obvious?

*Yuma, you\'ve considered attaching supersaturated grief cubes to the bombers, right? To disable the cruiser with a miasma?*

Demons had never shown a taste for the emotionless Cephalopods, it was true, but Ceph *technology* was still vulnerable to the miasma, sensors and communications equipment in particular.

*Of course not,* Yuma thought back immediately, annoyed. *That would be...*

Kyouko could imagine the objections, especially after own recent encounters with the subject: the restricted‐access, level five classification, the danger and finickiness of trying to time their use, the pointed Incubator complaints after the Shimada assassinations. In principle, they could even be court‐martialed for effectively gifting a bunch of grief cubes to the aliens---a potential intelligence disaster.

*...a very good idea,* Yuma thought. *You\'re right. We should try it.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It had taken Yuma a while to bring herself out of her malaise---a kind of fatalistically rigid focus on the tasks she had assigned herself.

Kyouko\'s idea carried in it another real kernel of hope, another improvement to their chances. It was up to her to help implement it, in the last few moments before the bombers arrived. If only Kyouko had come up with her idea sooner...

If only Yuma had come up with it at all.

A supply drone dropped three dozen used grief cubes in front of her, venting them directly into a funnel of her as‐yet invisible magic, where they hung suspended. They were stark even against the blackness of space, oozing an unsettling *glamour* that seemed to consume the starlight, like a constellation of dark stars.

She raised her hands, cradling a brightening sphere of green, then blinked twice. She filtered out the stars around her, the other magical girls, the ships, the combat---until that ball of green magic, filled with cubes of black, grew to dominate her vision.

Grief was a form of corruption, of entropy, just as the Incubators had always implied. Yuma liked to think of grief *cubes* as almost like little trapped black holes, always hungry for more grief, but unable to escape the confines of their box.

Forcing that box just a bit wider required *pushing* the grief in. Doing that* required the ability to manipulate grief, manipulate *decay*.

But what was a healer like Yuma but a magical girl transferring damage and decay from an injured victim into her own soul gem?

Even when working for Oriko, she had always been good at grief manipulation, though she had never been able to fulfill Oriko\'s dream of doing it without net magic cost.

She could only imagine what she must look like, staring into an orb of magic, tendrils of coarse, oozing grief visibly streaming from cube to cube. She forced the decay to concentrate in some of the cubes, filling the gap with some of her own *grief*, the expenditure of her own magic.

It was all pleasantly self‐contained, and she did her best to ignore the images the uncontained grief insinuated into her, all despair and hallucinations. She would have liked to go faster, much faster, but the process could only be rushed so much.

Then, she stopped, blinking until she again remembered where she was, and why.

*I\'m done,* she thought. It had only been a few seconds.

A group of magical girls surrounded her: teleporters and specialists, among them Ancients like Kana and Arisu, as well as a girl who could turn objects incorporeal, Amaranth.

They would have one chance to get it right, one chance to use the confusion of battle to slip the grief cubes onto the bombers, where they would make the journey back to the alien supply cruiser, just in time for the subtle instabilities Yuma had introduced to trigger a demon spawn.

They were very nearly out of time; the first missiles were arriving.

*Do you really think this will work?* Amaranth thought, as she split away with her payload.

*It has to,* Yuma thought.

She could never forgive herself if it didn\'t.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, their plan, however clever, did nothing about the immediate* threat, which they would have to survive in the usual, inadequate way.

Kyouko would have liked to look away as the faster‐than‐light missiles rained down on their defensive shell. Bursts of radiation illuminated fragments of hurling debris, the muted outlines of alien bombers, the glowing wisps of smartdust.

Instead, she could only clutch her spear, hard enough to crush steel.

When the time came, she---every copy of her---lunged forward into battle, a battle that she would see from dozens of perspectives, side‐by‐side with the others:

---vaulting off a friendly missile at incomprehensible speed. From a few photons her eyes performed an impossible feat, perceiving an alien missile and bomber heading the other way, distorted by length‐contraction. She cast her net before her for the barest of instants, and the collision radiated energy in every spectrum.

---wave after wave of missiles: Ravagers swarming, Raptors appearing too quickly to react, and stealth Wendigos, hard radiation warheads dark on their sensors. Their clairvoyants picked out most of them, but only most, and she threw herself at one, enveloping its radiation with her magic and her soul. That would save the girls around her, at the cost of only one body.

---she was unable to protect her bodyguards, far too young, blown apart before her eyes. There was no time for shock, only time to push her way through the expanding human wreckage, stretch her hand out for what she could save. In one hand, a green soul gem; in the other, only shards.

---missiles simply could not turn as tightly as she could, and she easily got inside the turn of the one tracking her. She sliced it as she passed by, careful to avoid the shrapnel, even as she lunged into another. She would not last here, but it was only one of her---

---at her side, despite her efforts, the human ship sheared apart, reinforced nanocomposite tearing apart like tissue as radiation and superheated debris blew through the interior. She dodged---and still lost an arm, sliced clean through except for a flap of flesh. She finished severing it herself---it would only slow her down now---as her blood vessels sealed themselves off and she spun through the void.

---and then it was all done, their fleet was a collection of wrecks, their three alien ships and four remaining human ones racing away from that graveyard in unison, magical girls rejoining them at the last second.

Low on power and grief cubes, Kyouko dove into the side of a ship. As her soul gem recharged and the drones brought fresh grief cubes, she reabsorbed the memories of her lost clones, casting all the death and failure into the pit of her soul, where she could look at it later.

She knew from those memories that Maki had survived, in no small part because of how closely she had stayed attached to Yuma, and felt relieved.

It seemed selfish, somehow, to care about that when quite a few others hadn\'t made it back, or had returned only as a glowing gem.

She didn\'t want to dwell on those thoughts, so she checked on the result of the grief cube mission---whether or not the supersaturated grief cubes had been successfully slipped into the bombers. She had preferred not to distract herself mid‐combat.

They had succeeded after all, though the casualty report was painful. Kana had collapsed unconscious after teleporting back, alone, carrying no fewer than four soul gems, including that of Arisu; Yuma was working on getting Kana back in action.

Kyouko swallowed, then closed her eyes, summoning her clones once again.

Her rest was over; it was a relief to be needed back in space.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Ryouko and her team, the pulsar mines had become a grueling race against the clock.

The fleet had thrown more ships and MagOps teams into the mines---whatever wasn\'t absolutely necessary to defend against incoming bombers and fighters---but that hadn\'t relieved them of any urgency, or quieted the sense of desperation that underlay all that they now did.

Nor had it removed Ryouko\'s personal thorn in the flesh. Reassurances from Azrael, Clarisse, and her own magic notwithstanding, she wondered what threat might lie inside her own head.

At least assault team casualties had fallen, now that the hazards of the mines and their gaps in space‐time were better understood. Rather than targeting the control staff of a given sector, it was more efficient to teleport right next to the stabilization equipment, destroy it, and leave. Patricia\'s team had stayed with them---the added stealth generator meant they no longer even got welcome committees.

They also hadn\'t encountered any more blockades on Ryouko\'s teleportation.

*That\'s number six,* Ying‐zhi thought, managing to sound a bit positive. *We\'re getting pretty good at these.*

They were taking a rare moment of rest, recharging their soul gems inside a quiet logistics room, safe under a bubble of stealth that drained the color from the world around them, the steady drumbeat of fleet updates tuned low.

Still, Ryouko paced the area, unwilling to relax. The break only gave her time to think: on the failure of the mission, on how she had been caged by the blink interdictors, on the *natural feeling* of the alien information packet bursting open in her head.

Earlier, Ryouko had pinned a Cephalopod to the ground, and as its head turned to face her she had suddenly feared that it would speak to her. Somehow, she had expected she would understand it.

She knew she wasn\'t taking all this well, but she didn\'t know what else to do, other than try to lose herself in combat, no matter how much it disturbed her afterward.

The only other recourse was to lean on Asami and, well, she wasn\'t here.

No one had responded to Ying‐zhi\'s encouragement, and Ryouko had to resist the urge to say something needlessly snarky. Mina eventually saved her by pitching in:

*Yes, we are. And I know what you\'re all thinking. The fleet is taking losses, and we won\'t be able to trigger a pulsar glitch, so there\'s not much to celebrate. But we\'re still doing real damage, and we\'re still on track to make it out of this alive. Just the damage we\'ve already done might take the squid years to repair. We just gotta focus on getting out of this, for our own sake.*

Some of the others nodded vaguely in response, helmets bobbing up and down, and a second or so later, Ryouko followed. It didn\'t really satisfy her, but what could?

*While we have the time...* Patricia thought.

She waited for Ryouko to register that the message was directed solely at her.

*Not that I should distract you more, but I\'ve been collaborating with Clarisse on some of the data for your uh, brain module.*

It struck Ryouko that she didn\'t really *want* to learn more, not in this context, but there had to be a reason Patricia was telling her this, so she stopped pacing and signaled Patricia to continue.

*Well, the comment I want to make is that when it activated, it dumped a good amount of some unknown signaling molecules, as well as firing in a pattern that was highly correlated with the information you were receiving, the---*

She paused.

*I\'m going on too long. The point is, Clarisse thinks the molecules are custom neuromodulators, and I agree. Those are very common in implant design, because they allow you to send global signals across a system that won\'t leak out into anything else. That gives us a chance to analyze what exact pathways lead in and out of it. Based on that, we think it\'s most likely a communication device, and not much else. You can feel safe.*

*That\'s not how I would have explained it,* Clarisse thought. *You could have just said it was safe.*

*I thought she would want to know why,* Patricia thought. *Though maybe that was too much detail.*

*I would want to know why,* Ryouko thought. *Though none of this settles the real question of why there would be such a damn thing* in my brain. I have enough nonsense to deal with.*

*I have a feeling that if we get the answer to* that, *it won\'t be from detailed study,* Clarisse thought. *Anyway, it\'s time we started getting ready to head out.*

A shiver of embarrassment passed through Ryouko, and she focused her attention on the world again, hoping she hadn\'t been holding the team back. She wanted to destroy as much of this place as possible.

She wanted...

She wanted it all to be over, she wanted to be back with Asami, somewhere stable, where she could stop and process it all.

Failing that, she hoped, guiltily, that this time they would at least have some real fighting.

She was still thinking about that when Oda\'s lightning disgorged them into a ghostly black‐and‐white hallway, the close twin of hallways they had been in before. The world around them wavered and twitched, as if viewed through an intense layer of static, but it was still possible to make out patrolling alien drones, alien personnel encased in protective bubble shields, and even details of the light, emanating from the ceiling in a slow, pulsing rhythm that gave the whole scene a nightclub quality.

They landed silently near those aliens, in front of a menacing laser turret, where the aliens had prepared a field of fire. An alien drone flew into their stealth field almost immediately, but, not sensing anything amiss, and with Azrael divining its route, it failed to run into anything.

They quickly identified the key stabilization equipment encased in the walls. It would take only a few seconds to destroy the machinery, and they wouldn\'t even need to fight the alien soldiers---they only had to defend themselves briefly.

But...

*Stop,* Ryouko thought, physically grabbing the girl about to plunge her sword into the wall, and pulling her away with perhaps too much force. Something is different.*

It was a combination of things. Her soul gem always reacted to exotic matter, and this time the reaction was *much* stronger. Besides that, she couldn\'t shake the sense that something... else was here. Something lingered at the back of her mind, as if someone was waiting telepathically for her to reply.

It took a long few moments of anxiously standing still and eyeing the nearby aliens nervously for her point to be entirely understood.

*Everything looks fine on the grav sensors,* Ying‐zhi thought. *Only minor discrepancies from the previous sites. Can we risk an active scan?*

*I can try to cover it, but no promises,* their stealth generator thought. *This isn\'t my usual thing.*

Ying‐zhi thought about it, but only very briefly---decisions had to be made quickly.

*Then everyone get ready for a fight. We might have to do this the hard way. I hope you\'re right.*

Ryouko didn\'t need Ying‐zhi\'s meaningful glance to know that the last line was directed at her.

*I hope I\'m right too,* she thought---but she kept that to herself, instead lighting up a bolt for her crossbow in anticipation.

She wasn\'t concerned that her soul gem was lying to her, just that it might be reacting to something irrelevant.

They arranged themselves into position as well they could, getting out of obvious fields of fire, raising barriers, and placing themselves where they could wreak as much havoc as possible, if necessary. Azrael monitored the minds of their enemy, looking for the slightest glimmer of intention to attack.

Ryouko, for her part, fired a single bolt into the ground, attached to a string.

Ying‐zhi toggled the active scan, and there was an instant of suspense, stretched thin by subjective time dilation.

Then Azrael gave the signal that they needed to attack.

Just because the aliens knew humans were there didn\'t mean they could see* anyone, and their blind‐firing was ineffective. Still, the magical girls acted quickly, to minimize the risk of any surprise explosions or radiation bursts.

As weapons fire began to break out and alien personnel began to fall, Ryouko performed her part of the job: teleporting a horizontal slice of the floor, a dozen centimeters thick, *above* the alien personnel, dropping it onto their heads, with herself on top.

It was a standard ploy---distract by manipulating the environment and destroy before the enemy could adapt. Ryouko had seen it done with rockslides and avalanches and twelve centimeters of alloy was in some respects worse than both.

The alloy landed on personal shields that were already failing from a barrage of attacks, with a noise that sounded like a staticky implosion.

There wasn\'t much left to do after that; the other magical girls had already neutralized the main threats, and the rest was rapid mop‐up, though Ryouko got to fire a few homing arrows into the mass of enemies---no explosives, not with one of her allies slicing her way through the area.

Still, it was satisfying, and the smoking, green‐strewn ruins took some of the edge off her frustration.

Then they turned their attention to the results of the active scan.

This particular mining site had more exotic matter---a lot, lot more, enough that it could have easily overwhelmed them had they relied on Oda\'s non‐instantaneous teleport. Since it hadn\'t shown up on passive sensors, it was tempting to guess that it had been set up as a trap.

*Well, now we know,* someone thought, unfazed by how close they had come to dying. *Let\'s exit a different way.*

That put Ryouko in the uncomfortable position of having to ask for another pause.

*Not yet,* she thought. *There\'s something else here.*

It would have been difficult to explain in words, so she sent it as a sensation instead, relaying the difficult to describe sense of expectation* in the back of her mind.

The question was, what was she supposed to do about it? Only one answer immediately suggested itself: answer the call.

*I don\'t need to point out how risky that could be,* Oda thought. *Not to mention, the longer we stand here, the more chance they detonate the machinery next to us without being polite enough to wait.*

*Listening to her has always worked for us before,* Mina thought. *Even before this mission. She\'s worth putting our faith in.*

Mina had been with her at Orpheus and X‐25, Ryouko knew, and made no bones about thinking that Ryouko had divine guidance. Ryouko couldn\'t even deny it.

But she also knew what the others would be worried about. With all that was going on in Ryouko\'s head---her literal, physical head---who knew how reliable a vague sensation of hers could be?

*Let\'s give it a shot,* Ying‐zhi thought finally. *But we\'re making a safety jump at the smallest sign of trouble.*

So with part of her will, Ryouko prepared herself to teleport far away, with much of the team gathered around her.

And with the rest of it, she tried to reach out and touch whatever it was that was waiting for her.

Nothing happened for a couple of seconds, and Ryouko started to worry that she was mistaken, that she was imagining things, that all of it was a product of whatever was in her head or worse, her desire to bury it all with the adrenaline of combat.

But a response came while she was still in the midst of twisting those possibilities through her mind.

It would have been difficult to convey in words. She got that there were* words, somewhere in there, buried in a mass of strange transmitted sensations and garbled half‐thoughts, confused enough that she found herself surprised it wasn\'t throwing her *own* thoughts off‐kilter.

*What is this?* she thought, implicitly asking Clarisse if she had any ideas. *Someone injured? A telepathic attack of some kind?*

*I don\'t know,* Clarisse thought. *But the implant in your brain is activating again, same as last time.*

The message repeated again, and this time she was able to make out an... overriding meaning, or perhaps just a prevailing sentiment. Perhaps she could even hear the word.

*Authentication?*

*Uh,* she thought. Obviously she had no answer to something like that.

*No, wait,* Clarisse thought. *This makes more sense to me now. This isn\'t normal telepathy. This is... some kind of garbled machine transmission. I can see parts of it in the firing patterns, but your brain isn\'t structured to handle something like this, and I don\'t think it\'s giving the right responses.*

Ryouko didn\'t know how to interpret that.

*I\'m receiving thoughts from a machine, that expects me to be a machine?* Ryouko thought, unsure if she was even making sense.

*None of us understand how the aliens really communicate,* Clarisse thought. *I know that\'s not really answering your question, but do you mind if I forward this to Patricia? She might be able to help. The parts of this I can read look like an authentication request, and I can\'t break something like that. Not without magic.*

*Sure, I think,* she thought, though she didn\'t really *feel* sure. Just, what else was she supposed to do?

It took her an effort to contain her emotions, which couldn\'t help but notice the tension in the air, the way everyone was staying taut to teleport away at any moment, huddled around her. No one could be sure if it was the magical girl instincts, the implants, or the veterancy that kept anyone from reacting prematurely.

That pressure ate at her, and she found herself wishing, not for the first time, that Asami was here to reassure her, or just to be there. It was a need she felt acutely as she watched Patricia consider what she had received, while the rest of the team seemed to wait impassively. Ryouko couldn\'t tell if anyone else was as bothered as she was, or just doing a better job hiding it.

A moment later, Patricia shifted her position in the huddle, making her way over so that she could touch Ryouko on the head.

*If I\'m going to work my magic on something like this, better that I have some contact with the source,* Patricia thought. *I just hope whatever is shielding the thing in your head doesn\'t interfere with this.*

Ryouko felt the equivalent of a telepathic knock on the door, one magical girl to another, asking for privileged mental access. Even with all the relevant context, it still took her a leap of faith to allow it, reversing the training Gracia had ingrained in her before.

She felt the slow rush of Patricia\'s magic surging into her mind, with a pounding that felt like she was carrying the ocean inside her head. She could sense Patricia rooting around inside, her presence unavoidably intrusive.

It took a good deal of effort not to double over, though she did put one hand on her head.

*Ah, there we go,* Patricia thought. *How kind of it to get out of the way.*

Patricia sent the last few words one by one, displaying effort even as she didn\'t explain what exactly she meant by \"it\".

A second later the pounding was gone, and Patricia had pulled her hand back.

*That\'s as far as I\'m going to get,* she thought. *I\'ve never seen anything like it. A computer system with access to telepathy! Well, kind of, it seems different from our own. On a different channel somehow. There\'s a lot to think about here.*

*What does it mean?* Ryouko thought, before clarifying. *What does it mean that I can hear it?*

Patricia made a strained expression.

*I don\'t know,* Patricia thought, to everyone.

Then, only to her:

*I imagine it means whoever put it there meant for this to happen.*

She waited a moment for Ryouko to digest the thought, then added:

*I was able to bypass the authentication system for a bit, but my ability to project my magic beyond the local systems is limited. You should examine what I retrieved. I know it\'s already in your head.*

As if summoned by Patricia\'s words, the images filled her mind.

More than images, she realized. She felt a kind of *understanding*, deeper rooted than any human cortical dump. The aliens were indeed configuring the pulsar mines into an ad‐hoc blink cannon, as they had thought, though the process had been almost completely dismantled by the human attacks. A blink cannon was quite simple in principle, once you could make wormholes in the first place. Lacking a stable gate on both sides, range was limited, but you could, with some effort, project the necessary gravitational effect to your exit point. It involved a certain kind of resonance, involving either very flat or---unexpectedly---very curved space‐time, not unlike her own teleportation.

She felt the sting of something sharp in her head, and almost reacted violently, only barely realizing that it had been Clarisse trying to get her attention.

*Sorry, I had to get you out of that* somehow, Clarisse thought. *You were entering some kind of induced reverie. Probably related to the, uh, alien telepathy.*

By then, the rest of the team had caught up with what was going on, at least superficially, and Ryouko felt rushed to get back in sync with them. She didn\'t want to seem like she was...

What? Losing her mind?

*I need to know what impact this has on our mission,* Ying‐zhi thought. Has anything changed?*

*We have a better idea of what the aliens are up to,* Patricia thought, relaying Ryouko\'s findings. *And that we\'ve already nearly got them neutered. There\'s only a bit more left to do.*

*Indeed, the updated orders just came through,* Clarisse thought.

*Then let\'s get back on the move,* Ying‐zhi thought.

They were already gathered around her, so Ryouko needed only to wait for the others to destabilize the exotic matter stabilizers, which they would do from a distance this time: Oda threw her spear into the wall, with an explosive charge embedded in the front that would detonate almost immediately after they left.

Ryouko found it difficult to think about anything other than what she had just learned. After all, what did her own teleportation do, other than open a wormhole with no stabilizer on the other end?

This time, when she tunneled through the fabric of the world, she felt unusually aware of the details. She didn\'t know exactly how, but this time, she noticed the small pulse of energy, the brief glimmer of what was on the other side.

There had to be other possibilities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*\"I think I\'ve got it stabilized! We can leave soon!\"*

That personal message, sent by Asami via the gestalt, blew a breath of relief into Ryouko\'s team.

Their pace of operations had slowed, as more and more of the other magical girl teams had arrived at the mines, allowing the fleet to begin gradually lightening their load, allowing them to proceed a bit more methodically, even as they were still all against the clock.

The exact timing of Asami\'s message left much to be desired, however.

*Ryouko,* Clarisse thought.

Ryouko ignored that, focusing on keeping up a barrage of arrows on the group of enemies packed in front of her. They needed to keep up the pressure, or else---

*Ryouko!* Clarisse thought, and this time the voice grabbed a disorienting amount of her attention, snapping her mind out of her intensely‐focused state.

I was getting carried away, she realized, as the greater context of their mission flooded back into her perception.

*What?* she demanded anyway, frustrated with the interruption.

*We\'re withdrawing,* Clarisse thought. *Besides, you got them.*

By \"got them\", Clarisse meant that the alien security forces crowding the access ways in front of them were pulling back, leaving behind dozens of corpses.

The aliens had managed to regroup a bit, encasing their remaining machinery in portable, volumetric forcefields that made it impossible for many teams, Ryouko\'s included, to operate purely from stealth.

*We didn\'t \'get them\',* Ryouko pointed out. *They\'re just regrouping closer to the device. They\'re fighting us to the death, so that\'s the only way this will end!*

*For our purposes now, you got them,* Clarisse insisted. *Again, we\'re withdrawing, so let\'s regroup and get out of here.*

*Are we just going to let them go?* Ryouko asked, making an angry noise inside her suit.

Clarisse didn\'t answer this time, knowing full well Ryouko was arguing out of pointless frustration. Now that Ryouko was a bit less... focused on combat, the information packets accompanying Asami\'s message were clear: the aliens were down to only a fraction of the pulsar mines left, with several other teams still continuing their attack. Once those were done, there simply wouldn\'t be enough left to continue interfering with Asami\'s wormhole, a fact verified by information Ryouko herself had retrieved from the alien systems.

There was much to be said for destroying everything *just in case*, of course, but they didn\'t have that luxury. Alien reinforcements were arriving in batches now, and orbit around the pulsar was hot with active combat. They were already overstaying their welcome.

*I know it doesn\'t feel right, leaving a job half‐done,* Clarisse thought. *But what we\'ve done here would mean a lot less if you died here. Please.*

Left untouched was the fact that *she* was being pulled out immediately, while several other teams were left to continue their work. She hated it, no matter how she justified it to herself.

Still simmering with an irrational frustration, Ryouko allowed some of the others to screen her as they fell back and re‐engaged their stealth. In a bid to think about something else, she returned to the question that had, almost disturbingly, bothered her ever since she had downloaded files off an alien system.

She was starting to be sure she could teleport something without teleporting herself. The blink cannon design had suggested a mechanism.

The reasonable part of her was quite sure that now wasn\'t the right time to study something like that.

*You\'re thinking about it so you don\'t have to think about how the mission is going, or any of the other stuff,* Clarisse thought. *You\'re better than this. You need to* focus.

*I* do *focus,* she thought. *When we\'re actually fighting something. And I don\'t know that anyone else has to deal with shocking personal revelations right now.*

Clarisse didn\'t dispute that, signaling her that the group was almost ready to be extracted. They were just waiting for confirmation from the ship that would be their ride...

There it was, and Ryouko suppressed a twinge of annoyance at Clarisse ignoring her. She released the internal tension that held her power in check, tunneling her way into space‐time to bring them to their destination.

Again she found herself hyper‐aware of the whole process---the bizarrely precise way in which space‐time bent itself to the exact necessary shape, the underlying particles rearranging *just* so, so that at the right moment the membrane underlying the world would pop open, swallow the target, and reform with the target in a new location. It was a wormhole, yes, but the briefest of ones, with a far more nuanced topology than she and Asami had ever achieved in their experiments, and a transition state that involved the true void of missing space‐time.

Part of this was her new augments, she realized---the implants that had expanded Clarisse\'s computing power to handle conditions around the pulsar also guided her perception in subtle ways.

*A successful interaction of magic and implant technology that is beyond what we can achieve,* Clarisse thought, when the teleportation was finished. *Supposedly, anyway.*

Clarisse paused for a beat, and Ryouko sensed it wasn\'t rhetorical---Clarisse was hesitating about something.

*There is, of course, an isomorphic holographic explanation of that teleportation process too, if you\'d like to hear it. I think it makes things a bit more clear.*

*No thanks, not right now. That was the only part of Tao\'s lectures I couldn\'t really follow.*

*I think you should try. But, perhaps not right now.*

They had arrived on the Magi Cæli cruiser *HSS Kautilya*, where an assortment of drones awaited them, scurrying to help them take off their helmets, refreshing grief cube stocks, and carrying away most of their weapons and equipment for rearming or refurbishment, following clearly marked drone trails to avoid being stepped on by the humans.

The room jerked suddenly, jostled by some unseen exertion of the remaining alien gravity modulators, and one of the drones started to topple over, dropping a few grief cubes from its tray---which were immediately picked up and returned by its neighbor, with the kind of unerring cooperation humans had come to expect.

The girls stayed in their suits, though, watching another flock of drones wheel in with replacement equipment. They wouldn\'t be staying for long, after all---just long enough for the cruiser to help transfer them back to the wormhole, where Ryouko would pass Asami before stationing herself on the human end of the wormhole, just in case she was needed.

She felt the flicker of frustration pass through her once more, amplified by the lack of activity. So she would be going back, while Asami did all the work.

She looked around a bit---the room they were in was a MagOps staging area, nothing but drones, equipment, and walls full of relevant combat displays, rarely relevant for a user base that was very used to cortical information dumps.

There was something she could do while she was waiting, if she wanted an excuse to work on her teleportation. Perhaps, if she just put some thought into it...

She bent over, asking one of the empty‐handed drones to temporarily abandon its current duties as she picked it up.

She started to visualize where she could send it, what she could do with it. Following what she had just observed about her own teleportation, it wouldn\'t be too hard to change the process. In theory, at least, all she needed to do was convince her teleportation to fold its space‐time pocket at a different location. Not around herself, but around a separate object. That was easy to say, but...

*I\'d strongly advise against doing this right now,* Clarisse protested. It\'s at best a waste of magic, and the others think you\'re behaving strangely already.*

*I* know *what they think,* Ryouko thought. *But I just want to try it. Look.*

She tuned out whatever Clarisse was saying, focusing herself on the drone. It fit neatly in both of her hands, with its dual‐optical devices peering up at her, and maybe, it just wanted to be somewhere else---

And then, it was, ten or so centimeters to the right, and she had to dart a hand out to catch it.

*I\'m going to have to stop you there,* Azrael thought, grabbing her by the shoulder. With a nudge, she encouraged Ryouko to turn and face her---which felt a bit odd, since Azrael was noticeably shorter than Ryouko\'s aged‐up body.

She remembered then, if she had ever forgotten, that Azrael was reading her mind.

They made eye contact.

*Listen,* Azrael thought. *I don\'t want you to overreact, but ever since you contacted that alien device, you\'ve been acting very strange. I know you have a history of overly aggressive behavior in combat, but your thoughts have been getting strangely obsessive, and now you\'re using magic we haven\'t seen before. I hope you can see why we might be concerned.*

Ryouko blinked, swallowing her initial rash response. Azrael was her friend, and... now that she thought about it, if truth be told, the others were *under*‐reacting.

*So where you\'re going with this is...* she cued, though she could guess.

*I think we should screen you for some kind of malign manipulation. Between Patricia and I, we have the magic for a volition integrity check. I still don\'t see how such a thing would be possible, but it\'s worth being careful.*

Mina started to say something, the protest written all over her face, but Ying‐zhi grabbed her before she could finish opening the channel. Ryouko appreciated the gesture of trust, she decided, even if it was a bit... religious in nature.

*I think that\'s reasonable,* Clarisse thought. *I can\'t really see how it\'s possible either, but it couldn\'t hurt.*

Ryouko clenched her teeth for a moment, deciding what to respond to first.

*I have the distinct sense you\'re hiding something from me,* she thought to Clarisse.

*The thing in your brain has been pretty active for a while now, mostly when you\'re thinking about the blink cannon data and teleportation. I don\'t see how it could be malicious, but I\'ve been monitoring. I didn\'t want to worry you any further, under the circumstances. I knew Azrael was watching too, so I thought that was safe. I\'m sorry.*

Ryouko had felt an unhappy anger rising within her, but the worry she could feel from Clarisse seemed to dispel it instantly. Something about the way she said it grounded her again, made her realize the absurdity of her anger at a time like this. She didn\'t like Clarisse keeping secrets from her---but it was justified here, and now *certainly wasn\'t the time to blow up about it.

*Not that I have a choice,* she thought to Azrael. *But, okay. Are we going to do this here? Don\'t we need to teleport again soon?*

By soon, she meant fifteen seconds, which the cruiser was forecasting as their timing window.

*After we get to the wormhole,* Azrael thought. *We of course can\'t linger here.*

If they really thought she was untrustworthy, they wouldn\'t let her teleport them again, Ryouko thought. That reassured her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It took Ryouko a moment to get her bearings again.

Here, at the lip of the open wormhole, the world was split in twain, the alien Taklamakan Sector and its pulsar on the one hand, and the human Tigric Sector with its gate assembly on the other, divided by a swirl of light that dazzled the eyes.

As she watched, frigates and a few magical girl teams sped through to the far side. The withdrawal was underway.

She spotted Asami nearby with her escorts, and felt a wave of happy relief, releasing the tension that had clenched its way around her heart. That was followed by a sting of anxiety as she remembered that this was just a passing visit.

Simona wasn\'t as conflicted, though, and pinged Ryouko for attention the moment she arrived.

*Finally,* Simona thought, when she got close enough. *I was so worried. I\'d go with you if I could.*

Ryouko nodded slightly, watching her carefully. She thought it was strange, that Simona would have *that* as a priority, rather than, say, the rushed evacuation, or the failed mission.

Then she turned to look at the girl in a colorful purple spacesuit, arms raised at the threshold between worlds, standing out in the crowd of floating magical girls, one of whom was maintaining a constant yellow‐tinged barrier.

Asami, for her part, seemed to be diligently focused on maintaining the wormhole, channeling magic constantly, without even glancing at the new arrivals. From a distance, Ryouko could just make out her grimly‐lined face.

Ryouko watched for a moment longer, intending to leave her alone, but Asami spoke first:

*It\'s nice to see you. I\'m glad you made it out.*

The words were simple, unadorned, but Ryouko could feel the emotion behind them.

*I\'m glad too,* Ryouko thought.

*I heard about what happened with the alien equipment. I hope, uh, I hope everything turns out well.*

Asami\'s voice was holding a lot back.

*It shouldn\'t be anything serious,* Ryouko thought, returning the simple thoughts in kind. They didn\'t need to be elaborate.

*I know Azrael wants to do another magic check on you,* Asami thought. Can you stay on this side of the wormhole while you do it?*

*That* question brought Ryouko back into the moment, with Simona staring at her from the left, and the endless chatter of the fleet in her mind.

It sounded like an innocent personal request, oddly out of place in this critical situation---but it was also relayed to the group, and came attached with the stamp of Command approval, unexplained.

*What? Why?* Simona thought incredulously, before anyone else responded.

Azrael appeared at her side immediately, as if she had known now would be the right time to confront her.

*Why indeed?* she thought. *I thought this might be a good time to ask you a few important questions. And you best answer quickly, given how much time we have.*

To accentuate her point, Ying‐zhi and two of the others appeared alongside her.

Simona tensed, her face developing a scowl as she looked back and forth between the others. She had only *just* been told what had happened with Ryouko\'s brain module, and had a lot to work through.

*I don\'t know what you\'re talking about,* Simona thought, after a moment, clearly restraining herself. *I told you; I don\'t know anything about that thing!*

*Are you sure?* Azrael asked. *Because we\'re about to volition check her, and if it\'s going to react poorly to that, it will be on your head.*

*I... wouldn\'t lie to you about something like that. If it\'s unsafe, I would tell you. I don\'t know anything. Scan my mind if you want to. Go ahead!*

*If you say so,* Azrael thought, lifting her hand and aiming it at the defiantly‐posed Simona.

Ryouko looked away, over at Asami, who hadn\'t so much as turned her head at the commotion around her, then at the pulsar, around which her mental interface labeled friendly and enemy ships, as well as fast‐moving debris fields. The screen protecting the wormhole was still holding up, for now.

She thought about Simona.

Having spent a good deal of time around the girl at this point, she tended to believe that Simona wouldn\'t deliberately hurt her, and she definitely empathized with what it was like not to be trusted, but she couldn\'t fault the others\' caution. Simona was an uncertain element---at best.

*If you\'re not hiding anything,* Azrael thought, her magic still streaming through Simona\'s head. *Then why is there a hidden memory connection I can\'t dereference? There\'s a special reason you\'re worried about this mission, something that happened since we last questioned you, but I don\'t know what it is. Care to share?*

*That* got Ryouko\'s attention, and she watched as Simona\'s face went through the motions of someone working out whether to deny something that couldn\'t really be denied.

Even Asami turned her head to watch.

*Fine,* Simona thought. *But it\'s not as if you\'re going to get very much from it. Not more than I got, anyway.*

*I\'ll be the judge of that,* Azrael thought.

Not long after, though, Azrael cut off her magic, shaking her head. She looked surprised by something, almost shocked.

*Alright, though that\'s not exactly reassuring,* she thought, more for the crowd than for Simona.

She signaled that she was ready to turn her attention to Ryouko, and Ying‐zhi and the others crowded in around Simona, surrounding her and continuing to question her according to Azrael\'s instructions---mind‐reads often missed the subtleties and finer points of inference.

*I suppose it\'s my turn then,* Ryouko thought, when Azrael got to her. Mind telling me what that was about with Simona?*

*After I scan you,* Azrael thought. *I\'m sure we\'d both rather it be over sooner.*

*Me three,* Asami thought, looking at the wormhole again.

It was a flippant response, but Ryouko could tell she was nervous.

Ryouko had some idea of what to expect: a deep search like this felt like a *presence* looming in the back of your mind, which was only unpleasant if you chose to fight it. She found that the hardest part of it all was staying still while Azrael and Patricia worked their magic, with everything going on around her: the battle in the background, Simona being questioned, Asami still working...

But the gestalt had elected not to wait until she passed through the wormhole, acceding to Asami\'s mysterious request, and Ryouko wasn\'t in the mood to complain.

*Still no signs of anything really off,* Patricia thought, at the end of it.

Azrael looked Ryouko in the eye.

*Akemi Homura, of all people, sent Simona a personal message,* Azrael thought. *Used some kind of magic salamander. Homura spoke as if she had played a big role in Simona\'s life, and then gave an apology which sounded rather... anticipatory. This was right after Valentin disappeared, and Simona thinks Homura might have* been *Valentin, which I\'m going to say, off the record, is pretty plausible.*

Ryouko wondered how to process this latest revelation. Homura? Valentin? What were they doing connected? What was she doing leading Simona around, then? It was probably best she save all that for later.

A shiver of empathy passed through her. If she was unhappy about being manipulated without her knowledge, Simona had suffered the same thing, but worse.

*We can confront Homura eventually, if we\'re lucky,* Azrael thought, sending Simona\'s memory alongside it. *But don\'t get tunnel vision here. I just wanted to fill you in. Anyway, I\'ve got to go keep an eye on Simona.*

Ryouko watched as Azrael turned away, deciding if she should examine the memory she had been sent.

Not now, she decided, steering forward to be right next to Asami. There\'d be time later, but right now, she needed Asami. This might be her only real chance.

*The gestalt didn\'t just keep you here for me, you know,* Asami thought, unprompted. *They were worried that if you were compromised, you\'d be most dangerous while inside the wormhole or on the other side. I hate that I had to agree with that assessment. It\'s not paranoia when the situation is* this *unexpected.*

Asami kept her gaze fixed on the wormhole, and it took Ryouko a moment to understand what she said, what she meant by it.

*It was within your right to worry,* Ryouko thought, trying to reassure. She meant it, too.

*Nevermind,* Asami thought. *That\'s not the main reason I asked. I heard about your new experiments with teleportation.*

Ryouko blinked in surprise, and before she could ask why Asami was asking, she received a packet of information from Asami, direct relay, that explained what she was thinking.

It was... audacious, to put it minimally. Audacious and clever.

*Yes, I could do that,* Ryouko said. *I\'ve never done it* before, *but here, with our wormhole to leverage, and with Simona...*

It was difficult to explain, but they both knew what she meant. When you unlocked a new kind of magic, sometimes you knew, instinctively, how it worked.

*Do you think you could run some experiments? Just in case?*

*Yeah, I suppose I could,* Ryouko thought, as her mind boggled with the implications of what Asami was proposing. *Let me process this a bit.*

It couldn\'t really work, could it?

All the pieces fit, though.

Asami\'s black holes were temporary constructs: physical, but with unphysical properties maintained by Asami\'s magic. Among other things, they had an event horizon substantially larger than made sense for their actual mass---it was the only way she could summon palm‐sized black holes without conjuring ten Earth masses.

When she dismissed her magic, they reverted back to being subatomic in size before the underlying singularities vanished from existence entirely. Thus, they weren\'t any kind of persistent threat; even a permanent black hole of that size, dropped into any kind of ordinary matter, would evaporate to Hawking radiation long before it ran into another particle.

That was for ordinary matter, though. The story was entirely different for *neutronium*.

In a material like that, even the shortest‐lived of black holes might never stop growing, even if the original mass immediately evaporated or, in the case of a magical construct, vanished entirely.

All of which suggested that if there were just some way to bring one of Asami\'s black holes into contact with the neutron star, the reaction would be cataclysmic---a total collapse, with all the attendant radiation effects.

Hence, Asami and the gestalt\'s question about whether Ryouko could teleport* such a thing. It didn\'t even have to land *inside* the pulsar; near the star, the milieu of charged particles in its intense magnetic field---and emanating from the polar jets---would sustain it just long enough for entry.

All of that, she grasped almost immediately, faster than she would have expected even with direct cortical injection, a lifetime of schooling, and her new support implants. The finer technical details, the numerical simulations---she didn\'t need to grasp those right away.

Asami waited the few seconds patiently.

*This is crazy,* Ryouko thought. *Ingenious, but crazy.*

*I know,* Asami thought. *But it might work. We have preliminary approval to try it,* if *there\'s a safe window to do it just before we leave. That\'s why you\'re staying here.*

Ryouko felt her head spin for a moment. All the latent frustration, anger, and dissatisfaction she had been feeling spiraled out of her. She had a chance to *do* something.

Then she managed to reel herself back in.

*I knew you\'d like the idea,* Asami thought. *Just remember we\'re still in danger out here. I want us both to make it home in one piece.*

This time Asami was looking straight at her, and Ryouko nodded once, making sure to show that she meant it.

Then she turned and looked at the others, who by now would be receiving fully updated orders.

It was difficult at first to tell that anything had changed, except that the gesturing around Simona had stopped, as something new took priority.

*That\'s incredible,* someone thought.

*I knew she wouldn\'t let us down,* Mina thought. *I knew there was a plan for us here.*

As an excited wave bubbled through the telepathic network, Ryouko remembered, too late, that Mina and Patricia weren\'t the only Cult members present. She was getting looks from some of the other girls, ones who knew her by her personal legend.

That was a silly thing to worry about now, she decided. What was important was getting things done, and that meant testing---

*I can\'t believe it!*

Simona\'s message, angry and loud, was so out of tone that it cut straight through the chatter, especially when she rocketed over straight at Ryouko.

*This is crazy,* she said. *You\'re crazy.*

It was unclear who she was speaking to until she raised her finger and pointed at Asami.

*Ryouko\'s clearly being targeted here! You know she only escaped earlier assassinations by a nanothread, and now you go and force her to be the last one out?*

Ryouko could only stare back in astonishment.

*I wouldn\'t be here at all if I only cared about my personal survival, Ryouko thought back. *And Asami\'s plan isn\'t even that dangerous.*

*Can\'t you* please *just let me protect you?*

Azrael and one of the other girls appeared at Simona\'s side, grabbing her by the arms.

*That\'s more than enough,* Azrael thought. *Back off and calm down.*

*You\'re being selfish,* the other girl thought. *Think about the long‐term projections they showed us. We\'re saving maybe millions of lives here.*

*Damn it, think about this!* Simona thought. *Your life, my life, it all fits a pattern. We\'ve been pushed into giving everything we have for the greater good, with no guarantee that we\'ll be able to hold on to anything. *We\'ve done everything they asked of us! Why do you need to come up with something more?*

Ryouko, who had been trying to turn away, felt an anger plume within her.

*Is that all you care about?* she asked. *Holding on to me? I didn\'t wish to be out here so that I could* hold still *for you. I\'m doing exactly what I always wanted right now.*

*Ryouko, does Simona need to be here?* Asami thought. *Can you do the teleport without her?*

*Maybe not,* she thought. *Can you control the wormhole without her?*

Asami returned a mental grimace.

Ryouko turned, grabbing Simona\'s shoulder.

*Look, I don\'t know how to say this, but we need you here. You\'re not going to talk me into leaving, even if I could.*

Simona didn\'t meet her eyes, instead looking down and away.

*You don\'t get it. I thought you would, by now. But I guess that\'s my fault. The thing is, that life you threw away, the one that\'s just 'holding still\'... that\'s all I ever wanted.*

She shook her head, clenching her teeth.

*Fine. There\'s not much I can do about it anyway. But if there\'s any sign of real danger, we\'re heading back.*

*That\'s what the plan says anyway,* Ryouko thought, trying to be soothing. *Look, you should focus on helping Asami maintain the wormhole. I\'ll be alright.*

It was an unpleasant experience, mouthing words that she could tell weren\'t having their intended effect. If anything, it just seemed to make Simona more sullen. She couldn\'t bridge that gap.

The girl seemed to calm down a bit, though, and after the others let her go---albeit with some reluctance---she even moved back to be near Asami, though Ryouko could tell Simona was still watching her with one eye.

She could focus now on preparing for their gambit.

*There\'s not much you can do about Simona,* Clarisse thought. *It\'s not your problem to solve. As long as she helps us finish up here, that\'s what matters.*

Ryouko nodded along, gathering her magic to begin trying a few teleports, just short‐range for now.

But while she did, her thoughts lingered behind her, within Simona\'s words. The blink interdiction, her brain\'s connection to alien tech in the mines, Simona, Valentin, *Homura*---it was like she was obediently eating up a trail of breadcrumbs, getting tidbits from everywhere, yet never reaching the full truth.

She had been delaying thinking about all that, but it had only gotten her blindsided, repeatedly. The way Patricia and Azrael had acted---*someone* obviously knew *something*, and had decided she didn\'t deserve to know.

*Chitose Yuma,* Clarisse thought. *At least, in part. Patricia told me, back in the mines, I was going to---nevermind. If you want to just ask her, I can send her a message, but I can\'t promise a response. The implant in your head may seem benign, but she might still have concerns.*

Ryouko had almost forgotten about Yuma---they had barely met twice. Then again, the Goddess had given Ryouko that long vision about her...

*Yes,* Ryouko thought. *Please. Ask her.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yuma watched the shields of the alien vessel near her shiver under the impact of another salvo of kinetic impacters, the faint image of the frigate rippling as its shields absorbed the stress. The ship had proven remarkably robust, but even it was starting to show considerable strain under constant pressure, despite having magical girls to defend it.

*And there goes the last of my ships,* Kyouko thought.

Yuma didn\'t know which of Kyouko\'s clones had sent the message, weaving its way through the frenetic, spiraling melee. She only knew that it seemed she could hardly blink without seeing another one die, blown apart, bisected, or simply vaporized. Kyouko was throwing herself into the grinder at a suicidal rate, buying the rest of them time.

Kyouko said nothing further. There was no point, with the command gestalt gone, replaced by a telepathic network so knottedly nested that they were practically thinking on top of each other.

Yuma bit her lip, awash with a sense of powerlessness as the seconds ticked by, even as she kept herself active, swinging behind a wall of Kyoukos to regenerate the arm and suit of an injured magical girl. There was nothing left to plan now, just an intolerable cauldron of combat while they waited for their paradox drives to charge, as their remaining ships---two alien frigates and one alien fighter---twirled and weaved heroically.

They were lucky they were even able to use their stolen paradox drives. Such a feat was notoriously difficult, and they might never have managed it had they not received a sudden trove of data about blink technology from, of all places, Project Armstrong, where it had been retrieved on‐mission.

Of course, the aliens needed no such aid to detect the humans trying to use a blink jump to escape.

The question would be: where? Blink trajectories were not easily traceable *a priori*, but they could be easily pursued after the fact. That meant there was only one destination that would seem to matter: the human reinforcements. Anywhere else, and the aliens would simply follow immediately afterward.

Jumping to the reinforcements would be an act of desperation, though; the time it would take to charge a jump was completely unsurvivable, not even taking into account the power drain on ship systems.

The Cephalopods, hopefully, perceived a desperate final gambit, a prayer for a miracle---and were responding accordingly, focusing most of their ships on driving home the attack, making attack run after attack run, while about a third charged their own paradox drives, just in case they were needed for pursuit.

Humans had proved very adept at miracles, after all.

Yuma ended her arm repair, leaving sections of ruptured skin and muscle to fend for themselves as she defended herself, enlarging her hammer to five times her size as she thrust it forward, an impromptu, almost comical shield to absorb the impact of a fusillade of missiles.

She wasn\'t even able to turn her head to look when their alien fighter fell away, vectoring out of control as its thrusters took a critical hit. Without control, it was helpless.

The impact on Yuma\'s hammer sent her backward, her magic straining against the exertion of keeping the magical construct intact and canceling the new momentum---her hammer needed to cover the arrival of another patient, blinded by radiation damage.

Nadya slingshotted past Yuma a second afterward, readying a telekinetic burst to thin out a second wave of missiles, far more efficient than Yuma\'s hammer‐shield. Yuma murmured a telepathic thanks.

Their alien fighter took a pair of missile impacts a moment later, transforming in an instant from friendly combatant to cloud of navigational hazards---Rin barely managed to get Jeannette\'s soul gem out in time.

Someone in their telepathic network gave thanks to the Goddess, a sentiment Yuma could not share. Not when they had lost the *ship*.

Yuma\'s plan didn\'t actually rely on any miracles, magical girl or divine.

The aliens were intended to *think* they were trying to reach the human reinforcements, but they were aiming only for the hidden alien supply cruiser. That made a huge difference in charging time.

This was a bit of deception that *had* to work, though. If the aliens realized what they were up to, they would realize it wasn\'t safe to have only a third of their flotilla charge blink drives---the whole flotilla needed to follow immediately, to prevent a gambit involving the cruiser.

It was already nearly too late for them to realize---now, several minutes in, the humans were almost done charging. Jeannette\'s ship had missed making it by only thirty seconds.

The girl whose eyesight Yuma had just restored released a bolt of sapphire magic that impacted something in front of them, spiraling forward almost too fast for her to see. Yuma caught a glimpse of a kinetic shell suspended there for a moment, before it spun in place and flew back towards its source.

Then the aliens changed their tactics. Perhaps they had attempted to contact their cruiser, or perhaps they had simply wisened up. Either way, half of the still‐attacking alien ships began charging their own paradox drives, while the other half burned all their energy stores trying to finish the humans off.

They would be late to the party. Every magical girl there knew how long was left, knew it was only seconds, and now they spun into new trajectories, abandoning the remaining inbound targets for a new defensive formation, right next to the ships---

Yuma found herself next to one of Kyouko\'s clones, who smiled at her. She reached up to grab her hand, a gesture so familiar, so old, that it brought back memories.

*Executing tactical jump,* Rose‐Merline and Charlotte thought.

The bulk of the alien supply cruiser appeared before them in an instant, close enough for it to dominate their field of vision.

To the assembled magical girls, though, it wasn\'t the disparity in tonnage discomfiting them. They were all immediately on edge---even more on edge, if that were possible---the moment they arrived. It was an instinctual reaction to the unnerving sense of *demons*, the oozing malaise of the miasma.

It felt almost paradoxical for that evil to be so welcome, but it was. Their gambit had worked, and the demons had spawned aboard the cruiser. The ship was still here, was barely taking any defensive measures, and its stealth had evidently failed. Several alien bombers had been disabled alongside it, mid‐refueling, and both cruiser and bombers shimmered with the ghostly sheen of miasma, caught between two realities.

But there was no time to extol their good fortune. Even as those thoughts started to work their way through her mind, Kana was already pulling them towards her telekinetically, drawing inward a sphere of magical girls who would soon be aboard the alien craft.

As they reorganized themselves, the first group of alien frigates and fighters appeared, those that had been charging their paradox drives the longest. Two Kyouko squadrons rushed out, hoping to distract them from less replaceable targets. Both sides opened fire despite being immobilized, and a few of the alien bombers flew in, despite their lack of armament, seeking to at least disrupt the human firing solutions.

Everything quickly descended into a chaotic morass, and stray impacts landing where there was miasma led to double vision, the damage in the exterior world leading to roiling instability within the miasma.

The world around Yuma shifted again, and this time she was inside the engine room of an alien vessel, its cavernous, rounded architecture palpably larger than any of the frigates she had been on.

Yuma was already moving, instincts kicking in to propel her aggressively towards a group of enemies before her, while a magic shell projected by one of the other girls took the hits. Not aliens, but *demons*, starved for prey.

It had been so long since she had done more than cursory, obligation demon fighting, but it came to her again like second nature. Kyouko\'s clones were already weaving a storm of chains, pulling a dozen of them together as she jumped up into the air.

With a crunch that rattled even her bones, she brought her hammer down on the floor of the engine room. A pulse of green energy snapped outward, disintegrating the group of demons on contact.

A jolt of telekinesis put her in flight again, this time high into the air, with a slight horizontal twist.

Now she scanned the room\'s floating antigrav platforms, the access points to the engine room\'s systems and engine core. Within the miasma, they faded in and out of sight, dream‐like and serene.

She finally found a cluster of demons grouped on one of the floating platforms, along with some of the aliens, standing silently in a circle. Diving, she swept them *all* aside with one broad, mass‐enhanced stroke, taking a few minor hits to her leg, easily healed.

*Bracing,* she thought, landing adroitly in a pile of grief cubes, green magic fizzling off her calves, ichor vanishing from her hammer. She\'d forgotten what it was like to fight in her teenage form, the intoxicating, irrational sense of power that came from... being slightly taller, and knowing, or at least thinking, you looked good doing it.

*We\'re clear,* one of the Kyoukos thought, echoing the telepathic network.

*Already?* Yuma thought. Demons were one thing, but they had expected to have to fight a wave of alien defenders as well. That was one of the reasons why teams had landed in the engine room and bridge, as well as the exotic matter stores---they needed to control the heart of the ship.

*We\'ve had a bit of a surprise,* Kyouko thought.

Yuma absorbed the details she was sent as she jumped down from the platform, accelerating her fall with an additional jolt of magic.

She needed to take a look for herself.

She landed next to a group of a dozen Cephalopods whose nearby demons had just been cleared away. They were unarmored, draped in robes patterned by colorful stripes. Layered on top of that were a few narrow cords, wound around their arms and chests.

They were also motionless, listless, eyes empty. Like human demon victims, not the emotionless aliens they were supposed to be. Alien technology was affected by demons, but not the aliens themselves. That was how it had always been.

Yuma shook her head at it all, then raised one hand.

Waves of faint green light rippled out across the room, pulsing outward from Yuma\'s skin. Life, even augmented life, was a fragile thing. One broken valve, one clogged tube---that was all it took. Minute decay, wrought by the gentle touch of green magic, brought them all down, down, until the aliens lay crumpled against walls and under workstations, deceased.

Yuma couldn\'t help but feel a frisson of unease, though, both at the necessity of what she had done---an irrational reaction, given the situation and her own history---and at the idea of Cephalopod demon victims. It didn\'t add up.

But, demon victims or not, anomalies or not, they would have become hostile given a few minutes to wake up, and she simply *had* to move on. Every millisecond Yuma lingered to study the situation was damage to the ships and to the magical girls who were her responsibility.

Without comment, then, and even as she felt Kyoukos\' gazes on her, she dashed towards the alien FTL core. They needed access to the ship\'s primary exotic matter supply, which would be tied to the engine---and for that, they needed the engine\'s cooperation, willing or not. It would have been easier with Jeannette, but...

She landed on a floating platform near the core, hovering directly in front of the primary field inducer. Here, half a dozen of the metallic‐silver rings that circled the core met at an enigmatic, blue‐glowing orb, the field inducer itself, about twice the size of Yuma\'s head.

Kana was waiting for her there, standing next to the bodies of three alien technicians. Yuma swept them aside with distaste, a brush of telekinetic magic that sent the bodies flying to the ground below.

Then she channeled her magic into the orb. It shuddered, then dimmed, as the two of them seized the engine\'s exotic matter containment and routing mechanisms. With it, they could divert, contain, or, if necessary, detonate the ship\'s exotic matter stores, a linchpin to what they needed to achieve.

A sudden emptiness tore at the back of Yuma\'s mind, and it took her a moment to register that the gap was one of their two remaining ships, and with it most hands, including the Ancient controlling it, Charlotte Meitner.

Yuma pushed those emotions somewhere far away, and stepped back from the orb, leaving it in Kana\'s care as she made contact with her for a teleport.

She needed to get back to Rose\'s ship---their *last* ship---to help power the shields while it recovered from its recent blink. *That* would be her role now.

The rest would have to be left to the others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manipulating raw exotic matter fuel was a messy, hands‐on affair, particularly as exotic matter was not exactly stable under standard conditions. Among other things, it needed to stay highly pressurized just to avoid explosive disintegration.

Fortunately for them, Nadya Antipova was on the case.

She prided herself on being Humanity\'s strongest telekinetic, not just in raw force output, but also in finesse and distance of projection. Even so, this task was a substantial exertion.

At a signal from Kana, they had cut their way straight into one of the cruiser\'s auxiliary containment tanks, full of reserve exotic matter intended for refueling bombers. That was the kind of thing that would have ordinarily triggered a catastrophic, radioactive conflagration, except for Kana\'s careful titration of the fuel they were receiving, allowing Nadya to contain and direct their supply with telekinesis alone.

On the engine room floor, around her and her two assistants, lay an assemblage of tubing, wiring, and metallic‐composite parts, much of it twitching and writhing in the manner of displeased smart materials. That represented all the relevant spare parts and equipment they could salvage, both from their own ships and from the cruiser\'s repair depots and missile bays. Next to this, up against the wall of the tank, Rin sat feverishly assembling it all into misshapen exotic matter charges, hands dancing back and forth at inhuman speed, parts snapping in from the pile in staccato bursts of telekinesis.

Of course, it wasn\'t *really* possible to take a bunch of spare parts and mash them together into a set of effective exotic matter charges, capable of furrowing space‐time and grounding ships, but Rin\'s magic could will it.

Rin signaled that the next device was ready, and Nadya began the transfer process, straining her magic to direct the stream of burning‐white exotic matter into the air and over into the waiting entry port of a misshapen patchwork‐rabbit of a bomb, nearly a meter in diameter and both cubic and spherical, depending on how you looked at it.

It only took about three seconds, but the exertion made it *feel* like much longer.

*Done,* Rin thought, sliding the device aside with one hand. *One more.*

Nadya waited, concentrating on her work, considering what was to come. Right now she had help, but when the time came to fire the charges, she would probably be handling most of the delivery herself---they were missing both Arisu and Charlotte, their next‐best telekinetics.

It was lonely, but she was used to it.

*Last one,* Rin thought.

Nadya gritted her teeth, both from the strain of her work and the reports from outside. The fight was much fairer than before, especially now that they had managed to take out one of the alien frigates, but with most of their magical girls busy aboard the cruiser, the difference in offensive capability was still daunting.

*Done,* Rin thought.

*Finally,* Nadya thought.

A girl sealed the puncture with a blast of magic crystal, while Nadya and one of the others levitated the bulky devices, nearly two dozen in all, a wall of floating metal that dwarfed the much smaller humans. Even one would be hard to fit through a standard alien doorway.

There was so much bulk, in fact, that they would have needed a strong teleporter to move it off the ship directly. Unfortunately, there were none left available, except for Kana, who was controlling the ship\'s engine, keeping residual exotic matter from breaking their weak seal while there were still too many aboard.

But they could always improvise, of course.

Two magical girls moved in front of them, brandishing a combination of oversized shield and magical laser cannon. They needed to get out of the ship, and the shortest path was a straight line, after all.

Nadya rather enjoyed bulldozing through reinforced walls, but this time it was best she let the others handle it, simply racing forward with her line of interdiction charges as a path vaporized itself through the ship. The cannoneer couldn\'t help but yell as they ran.

Then they broke out into the void, white hull fragments careening outward, and Nadya, Rin, and the others vaulted outward, propelled by the rush of air behind them.

They emerged into a panorama of chaos, with ships, magical girls, and their constructs and ruins littered at the side of the cruiser, mixing strangely with the demon miasmas still active in parts of the ship.

Here, where the contested area was narrow, fighting was dense. They immediately started tracking stray projectiles slinging by them, and one of Kyouko\'s clones rocketed by only a few dozen meters away.

But, for a few precious seconds, they weren\'t anyone\'s target.

They split up immediately, Rin and two Cult girls taking some of the contraptions one way, Nadya taking the rest in another, with the remaining girls returning to battle. Maki joined with Nadya shortly after, cloaking the two of them and their payload in a veil of star‐sequined black that would, hopefully, keep their activity hidden just a bit longer.

The exotic matter charges would have to be carefully targeted, engulfing the malaised alien ships in another layer of FTL inhibition, while still conforming to the overall geometry precalculated by the gestalt, so that the effect was mutually reinforcing.

There were three groups of alien ships to consider. First were the six ships already here, the originally designated pursuit ships. These they would need to hit right away, before the second wave of ships arrived---those that had started charging their paradox drives late. They would then have to take care of those too, to ensure they weren\'t followed in their escape.

Finally, there were the alien ships that had focused on trying to finish them off, who would arrive very late, having spent most of their energy earlier on attack. Hopefully they would arrive late enough that Rose\'s frigate would already be escaping, and so not be a concern.

She let the landscape of the battle around her unfold in her mind, augmenting her already formidable sense of space. An optimal route was already plotted out, and she and Maki were already on their way.

She kept her eyes fixed on the first drop‐off point, letting the battlefield flow past her. A stream of drones and other magical girls zoomed past in her mind\'s eye, entering and exiting her awareness with the smoothness of a ripple through water.

As they reached their target, she lashed out with a tendril of her telekinesis, launching one of the charges on an approach trajectory towards one of the alien ships. The onboard wiring would take care of the rest, detonating as it reached its destination.

But even as she spun away to the next drop‐off point, the lurching acceleration straining her inhuman flesh, her communications implants forced part of her attention to a new alert. The aliens were starting to target the drop teams.

Nadya gritted her teeth. That was unpleasant, but expected.

It was even factored into the route. She would drop her next charges much farther from their destinations. They would spend longer in flight, making them more vulnerable, but this let her cut corners on her route.

Her suit started relaying warnings that enemy drones had her in sensor lock, and she accelerated sharply, ignoring her internal damage indicators, pulling Maki along with her. Maki was doing her part with a pair of paint boosters on her back, but did not have Nadya\'s raw speed.

The sensor lock faded, and Nadya settled back in, letting the rest of the battle drop from her active mind, trusting her TacComp to alert her to anything truly critical. For now, focus and speed.

That had kept her alive for a good many years.

A few seconds later, her TacComp informed her that Rin\'s team had successfully hit a fighter, but had taken heavy radiation bombing in the process. They likely weren\'t going to finish their half of the first wave in time---Nadya would need to try to make up for it.

Nadya muted her frustration, focusing on her next target. She mapped out a less obvious trajectory, accepting suboptimal routing to make it harder for the aliens to predict where she was going---indeed, the optimal trajectory was already being combed with drones and sensor scans.

It would be a challenge. The frigates might be stationary, mired in blink malaise, but they were hardly harmless. Without the benefit of surprise, if Maki\'s camouflage failed they would be the recipient of a killing amount of firepower.

Thoughts raced across the human network, and in a few moments, they had an idea. Somewhere from their repository of tricks, they would marshal a classic gambit: a distraction.

That distraction came in the form of Kyouko, a *giant* Kyouko, larger than an alien frigate, wielding in two hands a massive spear and a hammer, courtesy of Yuma. It materialized near a group of Kyoukos, rocketing forward to give the next alien ship a big slam.

It was one of Kyouko\'s projections, of course, an apparition rather than a full clone, but the aliens *had* to take it seriously---it looked real on their sensors, after all, and some kind of giant magical girl was perfectly plausible, given all else they had seen.

Indeed, the hammer slammed into the ship\'s shields with a good deal of real force, sending a shimmering shockwave around it, even as the ship focused all its close‐in lasers and kinetic batteries at the apparition, which dissolved quickly.

This was Nadya\'s window, and she had already released her exotic matter charge, sending it with a telekinetic shove in the direction of the ship, right before impact.

Gravitational fireworks splashed across the human sensor relays, showing successful deployment, and Nadya raced away from the scene before the frigate could target her.

Nadya still needed to handle two more ships, including one of Rin\'s, and that was just from the first group of arrivals---the second group, five in all, was due to arrive in seconds.

It was fifty‐fifty which ship she would go for next, and the aliens would be on guard around both.

*After that last stunt,* Maki thought, *they might assume anything crazy‐looking we throw at them is fake. But if I generate something completely normal, like a brace of missiles, they\'ll* have *to respond, no matter what they think.*

It wouldn\'t be as effective, since the aliens would avoid overreacting and might smell a rat, but it was worth at least trying.

This time, as they approached their drop point, Nadya\'s implants began alarming again---something had gotten another sensor lock on them.

They veered away hard, Nadya hastily calculating a new drop trajectory, and she launched the exotic matter charge a bit early, using both her own momentum and telekinesis to jolt it onto the right trajectory.

Then she spun around, concentrating on deflecting the missile---

The missile veered away, seeking an imitation Nadya and Maki flying off in another direction. Nadya learned their charge had been intercepted by a bomber right afterward.

She didn\'t have time to dwell on either result, instantly turning to freeze and crush a trio of alien drones and blast them away.

*We need some cover!* she thought.

She got her wish, in the form of a splash of rainbow‐colored smoke, materializing around her faster than any conventional response could have possibly arrived. It blotted out the darkness of space almost comically.

A tight set of command codes bounced into her head, as brief as possible: authentication, phenomenon is friendly, navigate away along this* course.

The context filled in as she followed the instructions, but her implants filed it away from her primary consciousness. *Not useful at the moment.*

The lack of gestalt, and its attendant battlefield awareness, felt almost like a blindness, and it took far too long for the telepathic network to give her an important update: five angry sensor blips that represented the second group of alien ships making their appearance, neatly cutting her off from the two uninterdicted ships of the first wave.

Another warning echoed through her mind, and she raised a telekinetic bubble, bracing for impact---Kana was breaching the cruiser\'s remaining exotic matter, which would trigger a radioactive detonation.

The radiation front reached them about ten seconds later, glimmering off her barrier. She couldn\'t help but glance at the spectacle, a full spectrum of radiation gouging itself out of the side of alien shields, muted in the dangerous wavelengths she had tuned her barrier to block. As the cruiser spun apart, the miasma followed, and her eyes insisted on seeing both versions of events---both the ship fracturing, and the world within the miasma jerking chaotically, adapting to the new environment.

As the display continued to flare outward, the value of Kana\'s holdout was clear. By timing the release when she had, she was flooding local sensor nets with noise, creating pockets where it would be easier to hide, right when they would need it the most. The detonation killing most of the cruiser\'s remaining crew was an added bonus.

They were, all of them, pulling out every trick they could think of. It had to be enough.

New estimates entered her awareness, telling her that at the current rate, Rose\'s ship would exit malaise with two alien ships from each of the first two waves still uninterdicted. That was too many to feel safe, but it would risk everything to force the others to wait for her to hit a few more ships. Did they have any other choice, though?

Rather than put too much thought into that now, she focused on getting her work done faster, pushing the question to Yuma and some of the other, more stationary magical girls. With little left in the way of standard defenses, the humans had to use their magical girls to weather the torrent of new firepower, forcing almost everyone back to Rose\'s ship, spotting and deflecting incoming attacks.

She thus dropped her next charges without substantial support or distraction, launching them outward with as much speed as she could manage. One of the two was intercepted before it arrived, snapped out of the void by screening drones, but the second managed to find its mark.

*That was too close, though,* Maki thought.

Nadya gave her the merest blip of acknowledgment, splitting a bit of her attention to consider new route options.

She and Maki were splitting up, Maki and her stealth joining Rin and one of the junior magical girls---the other that had been with Rin was now dead---while Nadya would go it alone. She could fly faster that way, no longer having to drag Maki along with her.

That came at the cost of losing her own stealth cover, of course.

*Good luck,* Nadya thought, as Maki veered away, dragging a charge along with her using a loop of hardened paint.

*May the Goddess watch over you,* Maki thought.

And then Nadya accelerated.

The pressure came at her hard and fast, fusillades of kinetic fire and drone attack formations swarming towards her. She evaded frantically, using her incredible maneuverability to dance around the relatively slow kinetic fire. Lashes of telekinesis snapped at and smashed drones, and a personal force wall protected her from anything that got through, turning the world into a chaotic mess of swirling magic, incoming attack indicators, and close‐by drones, straining at the edge of her ability to track.

She flew in as close as she dared, scanning constantly for close‐in laser shots, and dropped her charges, this time with her personal telekinetic attention. The moment the first charge dropped, a wave of fire came inbound, filling her awareness with warnings. She stood her ground for a long few seconds, freezing what she could in place, barely catching a laser from behind that scorched her leg.

Then the charges detonated, a wave of gravitational distortion flooding her sensors, and she sped away.

Rin and Maki had been able to hit a fighter and a frigate as well, taking advantage of the attention Nadya had drawn, using up the last of their half of the charges.

Now Nadya\'s job got more difficult, as the aliens focused their attention on stopping her. There was no point in taking a circuitous route this time, and the incoming fire grew progressively more intense as she flew directly to the next ship.

*We can move again!* Yuma thought. *Get one more ship and get out!*

They had gotten the second wave of ships, but there were still two ships left from the first, with a very brief window before they became unstuck. Nadya couldn\'t disagree with the logic---the human defenses, their magical girls, were all but spent. Even one alien frigate in extended pursuit might be too much.

She dove into what was now a sea of fire, a maze of kinetic impacters weaving past her, with some of the last surviving human drones trying to shield her route. Even as she wove this way and that, she took hits to her telekinetic bubble, explosions of light that she mostly felt rather than saw.

Still, a crooked smile came to her lips. This had always been the alien problem in space combat---ships were faster and stronger, and missiles were extremely deadly, but nothing had the maneuverability and flexibility of a magical girl.

Despite that confidence, she pushed herself more desperately. Her window was closing; she would be the last magical girl still outside Rose\'s frigate, with Kana making a special jump just to bring her in as they flew away. Every moment she spent out here put everyone at risk.

So she flew less evasively, letting a few shells and drones slam into her, metal parts shattering in explosions of light as they hit and skidded across her barrier.

And this time, when she deployed her charges, she sent everything she had left, several charges blasting away from her like so many rockets. She dove away immediately, leaving them to their fates---if they failed, they failed.

She had hoped that the incoming fire would abate when she embarked on an obvious escape trajectory but it became, if anything, more intense. She found herself losing more and more time trying to evade, and *still absorbing heavy blows to her shell, explosions of energy blotting out parts of her sky.

*Why the hell are they targeting me?* Nadya thought, in angry despair. They should be focusing on the ship!*

She was also losing sensor coverage now, and was forced to rely on her own techniques, sending out pulses of telekinesis as a kind of radar. It worked, but it ate into her limited focus.

Her progress was slowing to a crawl, but she was still moving forward. That was enough. They would wait for her.

Then the sky opened up next to her.

She snapped herself into a skull‐wrenching turn, damage pulsing across her body, as she barely avoided slamming into the newly arrived alien vessel, black and menacing against the stars.

The third group of alien vessels was here, just a bit ahead of schedule, appearing around the single human vessel. They were *too early*, and Nadya was still too far to be recovered.

Nadya knew then that a decision had been made for her.

*Leave me,* she thought, and she wasn\'t offended that the others were already heading away.

Kyouko sent something back, but she didn\'t care to read it. She knew what it would say.

Like most who had gone so old to the front lines, she had rehearsed this moment in her mind, made her peace with it. Her children were grown, she had lived long, no one could fight forever.

But that didn\'t mean she had no regrets. She hadn\'t found Misa or finished the job with Kyouko. She wouldn\'t live to see some of her grandkids grow. She wasn\'t *done*.

But could one ever be done?

She turned towards the ship next to her, maintaining her shields as fierce as ever, and snapped her necklace off its chain.

Soul Guard legend said the technique had first been formally taught at the beginning of the Unification Wars, and that it had been perfected by tireless research by one of the Mitakihara Four. Perhaps Mami, perhaps Kyouko.

It didn\'t matter.

She tossed her soul gem in front of her, as it seemed to grow to encompass her world, and she saw herself reflected in it, saw the cracks forming as her soul strove to escape.

In it, she saw her memories. Her children, her husbands, Clarisse, Misa. Walking outside under the summer sky to show her daughter the aurora.

Where would it go?

She didn\'t see the ships around her disintegrating in the light.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Fuck.\"

Kyouko couldn\'t say she disagreed with the sentiment, even if it came from Maki rather than her.

A few sobs escaped from Armelle, the girl Kyouko was comforting.

*Kyouko* had kept herself composed, restraining herself to only slamming her spear into the wall once. Right now, that was her duty as a leader. She would let out a little emotion later, smash something on this damnable vessel, feel some pain.

No matter how bad they felt, their position was still better than most of the girls she had brought with her.

Kyouko looked over at Yuma.

They hadn\'t thought it would be over, not when there was still an alien frigate that could have given close chase. But it had turned back, abruptly, after only a brief pursuit.

It was uncharacteristic for the aliens. Kyouko couldn\'t help but wonder if a single extra ship---like the one Nadya had given her life to stop---would have changed that decision.

Maybe. She wanted to---*had to*---believe in that.

Yuma was healing one of the human commandos she had brought along, staring out an alien viewscreen with a look like someone had put bittermelon in her food.

Kyouko hugged Armelle a final time, then walked up next to Yuma. She didn\'t have anything to say. They had botched this, plain and simple, and they weren\'t near done paying for it.

*Look at this,* Yuma thought, jolting Kyouko out of her mood.

Kyouko read Ryouko\'s relayed message with increasing surprise. She\'d been ignoring the press of urgent calls and major news at the back of her mind, but of course Yuma hadn\'t been.

*We need to talk to her anyway, but do you think I should answer her questions?* Yuma asked, still looking out the viewscreen.

Kyouko thought about it.

*I think so. But you\'d hate the reasoning.*

Yuma finally turned toward Kyouko, and the pair locked eyes briefly.

*I thought you\'d say yes,* Yuma thought, fatalistic. *Well, it probably couldn\'t be avoided. Everyone\'s going to be all over our business soon enough anyway.*

*Can\'t say I even blame them,* Kyouko thought.

Yuma sighed.

\"We have a lot of work to do,\" she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Ryouko\'s surprise, Yuma sent her a response within minutes. She had expected she might be waiting weeks. She certainly hadn\'t expected anything while she was still on‐mission---though, now that she had successfully tested her new teleport with Asami\'s black holes, she supposed she had the spare attention. Had Yuma been watching her that closely?

*It\'s marked time‐sensitive, or at least some of it is,* Clarisse commented. *I think we should hold the rest for later though, if that\'s alright.*

Ryouko hesitated; she had wanted answers, yes, but Azrael had a telepathic eye on her. Was it really wise?

While she thought about it, another fast‐moving cruiser flew past her, its profile occluding most of the sky as it went. Streaks of radiation framed it against the background, illuminating the debris of battle.

She decided then she didn\'t care too much---it *was* Azrael, after all. Keeping a wary eye on Asami and Simona, she began to digest Yuma\'s message.

> The enemy organization we believe tried to kill you has been exposed, and is retaliating in part by leaking lurid reports about you. They center on the genetic engineering done to you, but also include your Cult connections, Simona del Mago, and your revival in a cloned body after X‐25. Character assassination, in short. There is a brief window of time for me to get ahead of the story, start a media campaign, but I need to know that you\'re willing to have all of that exposed across official channels. I need to know now, if possible.

*What the hell?* Ryouko thought. It wasn\'t even an answer to her questions, and her *reputation* was probably the furthest thing from her mind at the moment. But what...

It took a bit for the other attached information to sink in, even if it was all tailored for rapid cortical download. She wasn\'t the only target---they were going after everybody, leaking inflammatory information about Yuma, Kyouko, the Cult, pretty much everyone working against them.

There was even more to read, even if Clarisse was frantically signaling that she should stop.

Yuma *had* answered her questions. Yuma not only believed that Valentin must be Homura, she had uncovered that Valentin---that *Homura*---was personally responsible for Ryouko\'s genetic engineering. Moreover, Ryouko\'s parents were partly culpable. Valentin had promised to genetically engineer low contract potential in their daughter, under the guise of an implant study.

When her parents realized they\'d been tricked, Homura had erased their memories.

The worst was this: contrary to Patricia\'s initial analysis and subsequent assurances, whatever Homura had put in Ryouko\'s head *could have altered her personality, all the way down to her very core values. Though, they weren\'t sure if it had.

Yuma had, nevertheless, apparently just been convinced that Homura\'s actions were... if not good, then at least meant to protect humanity. Ryouko supposed it only made sense to finally extend some of that trust down to her, the girl who was evidently Homura\'s pet project.

Ryouko couldn\'t resist looking over at Azrael, who was maintaining a carefully closed expression. Azrael looked back when she did.

*I\'m not really sure what to say,* Azrael thought. *Only that I am here for you if you need it.*

Ryouko put her hand on her helmet, closing her eyes. The whole world was going to learn this soon. Her life might be turned upside‐down.

*Do it,* she responded, to Yuma. *And please let me know what the hell is going on when I get back.*

*Of course. The secrecy I have worked with has carried a great cost. I think I made a mistake keeping you penned up before. For that I am sorry. There\'s a lot I want to work through with you after this. It will be in your control.*

Ryouko experienced a spike of emotion from Clarisse, its meaning clearer than could be directly said. She empathized with how ridiculous, how unmanageable the situation was, but right now, what was important was Asami, the wormhole, and the mission. Other things were for worrying about when they got back. Even about what was in her head.

Ryouko opened her eyes, looking at Simona, entertaining the brief fantasy of grabbing her by the neck and shaking her, as if she were to blame for everything.

Then she swallowed hard, tuning back in to the half of her mind that had never stopped watching her surroundings, letting her combat environment flood back to the forefront, full of contextual highlighting and instinctual processing.

The last third of their fleet was now evacuating, leaving behind as many drones, mines, and other expendable munitions as they could to provide a lingering presence. When the final cruiser made it through the wormhole, it would be time for her to enact Asami\'s gambit, and she needed to be ready.

She peered at the edges of the wormhole for a few seconds, losing herself in the way the spinning starlight swirled there. It reminded her of the space‐time aberrations at Orpheus, and in a different hour she might have found them beautiful.

The starlight jittered, and her suit rockets fired automatically to keep her in position, gravitational alarms toggling all over the landscape of her mind.

*What was that?* one of their escorts asked.

This rhetorical question was answered almost immediately by the fleet, which pointed out an alien cruiser‐based task force that had just arrived in orbit on the far side of the pulsar. *Something* there was emanating gravitational pulses, and coordinating with the remaining gravity modulators too---though not the mines, which had finally been incapacitated, at least.

Another pulse struck them then, intense enough to send her briefly backward.

*This must be an attack on the wormhole,* Simona thought. *They\'ve brought some kind of gravitational weapon with them!*

The implications were obvious, but there was no way to rush the evacuation any further.

*Battle simulations no longer converge,* the gestalt informed them. Emergency abort authority has been granted to Captain Zheng Ying‐zhi and First Lieutenant Nakihara Asami.*

The directive was familiar from simulation---it meant the decision rested almost entirely on magic now. Only Asami could know whether or not the wormhole was still stable, and whether they could still stay. Ying‐zhi would interface with her telepathically, via Azrael, and make the call if Asami froze, faster than the gestalt could.

*You hear that?* Simona thought, pained. *We should get out of here right now! We have to protect Ryouko.*

*I\'ve got the wormhole under control,* Asami thought. *This isn\'t some kind of new alien weapon, they\'re just abusing their paradox drives. I\'ve got this. We\'ll be fine.*

Simona made a gesture as if to swing her arm around, but seemed to think better of it. The way they were positioned---Asami near the wormhole, Simona nearby to provide magical support---she would have come close to hitting the other girl.

*You don\'t know that,* Simona thought. *The alien attacks are going to intensify. If you lose control, we\'ll all be stuck here.*

*There will be plenty of warning,* Asami thought. *And if we leave now, not only will we be giving up on the mission, it will be much harder to control the wormhole from the other side. If it collapses, there will be thousands of people left stranded out here. Trust me. Right now, we\'re fine.*

*Where does that certainty come from?* Simona snapped. *This isn\'t a matter of your pride. You\'re putting us all at risk.*

Ryouko felt her suit shudder, another alien pulse thrumming through the area.

*Don\'t you dare talk to me about pride or who I\'m putting at risk, Asami thought, hands visibly clenching. *I* know *what I\'m putting at risk and I\'ve agonized over it. You\'re lucky I need you to keep this wormhole contained, or I\'d throw you back in myself.*

*Keep your opinions to yourself, Del Mago,* Ying‐zhi thought. *She is under a lot of stress, and this is not the time to be making it worse.*

*You seriously can\'t all agree with her?* Simona asked, incredulous.

*You\'re the one being irrational right now,* Ryouko thought. *How have things gotten any worse than when we were in the pulsar mines? Why are you freaking out now?*

*Because* now *we have the option to escape. And right now―*

Another pulse slammed into them, strong enough to trigger the barrier around them, which shimmered and rippled under the impact. Behind it, the wormhole rippled only slightly, the ring of light around the mouth shifting position briefly.

Simona radiated a wave of telepathic skepticism, drawing another rebuke from Ying‐zhi, but Ryouko found her attention pulled away by... a strange tap at the back of her mind, like someone attempting a telepathic connection from too far away.

That didn\'t make any sense, though. Their communications were up and running; there simply wasn\'t a reason to attempt something like that.

The tapping repeated, more strongly, and this time it came with a confusing carrier wave of sensations---nothing that made sense, signals that oscillated back and forth---as well as almost literal white noise.

Azrael picked up on it, of course, at the same time that Clarisse let her know that the feeling, whatever it was, was coming from her brain implant.

What were the aliens trying to do?

*We can\'t stay here,* Simona insisted, suddenly. *Not if they\'re going to keep trying to do... things to Ryouko\'s head. We don\'t know what it\'s capable of! What if it\'s a threat?*

Of everyone there, Ryouko had *least* expected Simona to raise that objection. Wasn\'t she tied in with Valentin? With Homura?

But Simona knew less than she did, she realized. Azrael\'s recent mind‐read proved as much, and Simona hadn\'t been told about Yuma\'s message.

Ryouko forwarded the information to Simona then, after passing it by Ying‐zhi for cursory approval. There wasn\'t much of a secret left to keep, after all, not now that an enemy organization had started leaking it.

She found herself loosening a bit as Simona took in the information, watching a stream of frigates pass by, camouflage coatings shimmering against the dark. She wouldn\'t have felt comfortable keeping this kind of secret, or trying to fabricate a lie. This was much simpler.

*This isn\'t good enough,* Simona thought.

Ryouko\'s attention snapped back to Simona.

*This isn\'t good enough,* Simona repeated. *It just makes things worse. *None of you has worked with Valentin like I have. We\'re all just pieces on a chessboard to her, and no one hesitates to sacrifice even a queen if it wins the game.* Especially *not Homura.*

*It seems, checking now, that Command did consider the possibility of a Homura plot during planning,* Ying‐zhi thought, tone neutral. *But it concluded, and continues to conclude, that the threat is very low. Right now, Ryouko is worth much more than the remnant of the pulsar mines. Who would have both the foresight to invest in something for fifteen years, and the myopia to just light it all on fire? I understand where you\'re coming from, but there are better strategic decisions.*

*You don\'t know the kind of insight she has,* Simona thought, her shoulders tense with stress. *I\'ve* seen *what she can do, the inexplicable decisions that always turn out right. She designed this part of Ryouko! The part that\'s been acting strangely all mission, a mission where she sent me a message apologizing for everything. I don\'t think we\'re intended to survive this.*

*Anything Homura does is ordained by the Goddess, and I don\'t think the Goddess sanctioned killing us all,* Mina snapped. *I don\'t know what your problem is, but---*

*That\'s not helpful right now,* Ying‐zhi interrupted, warningly. Regardless, Simona, we don\'t have time to belabor this. Command says you shared all of your memories of Valentin back when you first handed yourself over, and they\'ve already taken them into account. I need you to give me another reason to believe what you\'re saying.*

The other magical girls began subtly drifting their positions, getting ready to secure Simona if necessary.

*I just need you to believe me,* Simona thought. *I know it sounds unlikely, but I made my wish for Ryouko, and now my experiences and my instincts are both telling me that something is wrong, and it terrifies me. Ryouko* cannot *stay here.*

Ying‐zhi paused. The silence was heavy.

*I\'m sorry, but that\'s not enough,* Ying‐zhi thought, finally.

Simona\'s frustration was palpable telepathically, but it seemed for a moment that she would subside into emotional suppression, and Ryouko relaxed a bit.

Azrael nixed that idea: Simona was *overriding* emotional suppression, and slipping out of control, fast. Desperate plans were taking hold in her mind, schemes to withhold her magic and coerce Asami into an early abort, ways to take advantage of some alien attack and seize Ryouko, to save Ryouko, whether she wanted it or not.

*Force her into emotional suppression, then!* Ying‐zhi thought, clearly an order.

A terrible black ooze began enveloping Simona\'s head inside her helmet, and two melee girls sprang forward to secure her. Ryouko tensed herself.

Blinding orange light obscured the scene temporarily.

Then a gravitational shudder hit their barrier, from the wrong direction.

*What the hell are you doing?* Asami thought, as Simona rocketed away from her towards Ryouko. Asami snatched at Simona with purple magic that, for a second, seemed to slow the rogue magical girl. But the wormhole shuddered, and Asami was forced to whirl about to restabilize it.

Simona tore through several attempts to lasso her, evading or shoving aside magical constructs and thrown weapons with bursts of magic.

*If you all insist on being fools,* Simona cried, fury scorching Ryouko\'s mind, *then I\'ll do this myself!*

*Contain her!* Ying‐zhi thought, her barrier warping into place in front of Simona.

Simona stretched out her hand, projecting a cone of orange magic that covered the sky around Ryouko in shimmering color. Ying‐zhi recoiled, her barrier melting, and Ryouko realized too late the cone of magic was directed at *her*, inhibiting her teleportation. Where had Simona gotten a power like this?

Ryouko fired a bolt at Simona to force a dodge, buying just enough time to whirl and kick at the other girl. Ryouko\'s experience saved her---Simona was just a little bit slower, and that was enough for Ryouko to get away.

Simona\'s thrusters flared suddenly, pushing her away from Ryouko. She grabbed at her helmet as it was swallowed by a pool of black, Azrael\'s mind‐control tearing into her mental defenses.

*Get out of my head!*

Simona powered through Azrael\'s control with a blast of magic, sending Azrael reeling as she launched forward again, still heading towards Ryouko. Ryouko found herself *still* unable to teleport and, lifting her arbalest, now hardly able to summon a bolt.

She drew her SW‒155 pistol instead, aiming for Simona\'s head. Her training had prepared her a little, but she had still never fought another magical girl.

She fired a spread of shots before she could finish the thought, and Simona came to a crashing stop. Ryouko thought, for a fraction of a moment, that *she* had done that.

*It turns out,* Asami thought, one hand stretched out towards them, that I* don\'t need you *to keep the wormhole open. So I think you deserve a timeout.*

Simona writhed fruitlessly against her gravitational prison, as a stream of drones latched onto her limbs and began scurrying over her body. An orange glow enveloped her soon after, but it came too late---by then, one of the drones had successfully pried off her soul gem core and rocketed away, quickly passing one hundred meters with the help of a gravity‐slingshot from Asami.

Ryouko watched Simona\'s limp body disappear into the wormhole, image twisted into a spiral by the edge, and a slight chill ran through her---she was missing the previous warmth of Simona\'s power enhancement, she realized.

She turned to Asami.

*Are we okay?* Ryouko thought.

*We\'re okay, as long as it doesn\'t get much worse,* Asami thought.

She grimaced, and the light from the wormhole seemed to shiver in sympathy.

*The faster the better, though.*

The stream of ships passing near and around them was accelerating, cascading into one final crescendo of cruisers that, when finished, would leave them nearly alone, with less than a minute, at best, to finish the job.

The aliens were taking advantage, with weapons fire and even ships approaching ever closer to the wormhole. In just the past couple minutes, dozens of frigates in the rearguard had shattered into pieces of debris.

Ryouko didn\'t need an explicit instruction to get ready, focusing her thoughts on what she now needed to do. With one figurative eye on the countdown timer, she focused inward, visualizing the task, imagining space stretching slowly.

Another wave of static hit the back of her mind, the aliens seemingly at it again. This time, it faded quickly. No matter; Azrael and Patricia and Clarisse were all watching her, just in case anything happened.

She looked up as the last cruiser, *HSS Shelton Mason*, flew past them into the wormhole. It was time.

Ryouko arrived next to Asami, who nodded her helmet, raising one hand to summon her signature black hole, which hovered in front of Ryouko. Ryouko placed her hands around it, careful not to get too close.

It was amazing how natural it all seemed now. Like Asami, she could almost visualize what was happening, almost see the black hole sinking inexorably into a fold in the fabric of space. It would be delicate, nesting an event horizon into a larger wormhole opening, but she could do it.

The cordon of magical girls contracted inwards towards her as she focused her magic, defense drones swarming around them to buy the precious seconds they needed, dying by the hundreds every second as alien attacks scorched through the area around them.

Ryouko sealed away the rest of her thoughts, pouring all she knew into her magic. The distance the black hole needed to travel was longer than her usual range, but the conditions were perfect. Space was already heavily warped by the pulsar, with the singularity itself a needle‐sharp puncture, and she again had their enormous wormhole to assist. Without Simona, it would be harder, but it *was* possible.

She imagined her magic pushing it inward, straining against a tremendous energy barrier, seeking a new equilibrium. She kept her eyes open, watching the magic that now enshrouded the black hole, a ghostly green glow starting to swirl inward, disappearing not into the black hole, but into something else.

Less mobile team members exited early, while Oda and a core team finished gathering together, ready for the escape teleport that would carry them the few remaining meters between them and the kilometers‐wide sphere of the wormhole\'s mouth---and then through it, to home. They would have only a moment before Asami\'s black hole reached the pulsar\'s crust, and then even less before the shockwave reached them.

The pressure in the back of her mind returned, same as ever, but there was no time to pay attention to it now.

The steps played out just as they had in her mind, just as they had in her test runs. A final burst of energy ruptured local space‐time. Her magic molded it, as it tried desperately to snap back to a low‐energy conformation. For a moment, it connected strangely, attaching itself to a distant location. In that instant, the small bit of quasi‐matter in Asami\'s singularity, matter granted only temporary existence by her magic, passed through.

Even the fastest of human clocks would have struggled to keep pace with these events, but it seemed to her that she could.

The next steps, though, she could not see, nor was it wise to try to see.

Asami\'s black hole, burgeoning with energy absorbed near the pulsar, was destined for the pulsar\'s crust, home to some of the universe\'s greatest stresses and densities, all precariously bound into a perfect rigid sphere.

*The most energy any human has ever released,* Ryouko thought. *And I won\'t even be around to see any of it.*

Oda\'s escape jump began even before Ryouko finished, converting the group of magical girls into enchanted lightning bolts with no time to spare. The world around them flashed by in glimpses, the telltale distortion at the mouth of the wormhole, the profound darkness of new space inside the wormhole, the opening to Adept Blue before them---

A sound interrupted the silent, ethereal experience.

A sound? That didn\'t make sense, but Ryouko found herself abruptly aware of everything around her, though her field of view was rigidly, painfully outside of her control.

Before her was the way out of the wormhole, a sharp circular window out onto the stars, geometrically perfect, with the silhouette of the Armstrong apparatus looming. Around that lay pitch‐black, dark enough to look like a glitch in space, but in that darkness, the bright yellow of her fellow magical girls traced a path forward as lightning.

Then, something broke.

The way out twisted, and what had been a clean window contorted, the boundary spiraling inward and shredding outward---outward, shards of light right at them.

Oda did what she could, steering them towards the suddenly unpredictable exit, but it approached so erratically that only some of them made it through: Asami, Ying‐zhi, Azrael, Mina, and several of the others. Ryouko, Oda, Amane, and Patricia did not---they were still trapped in the wormhole, the boundary now receding away from them.

In the following milliseconds they passed their original exit point---the new exit point had moved, somehow, far away.

In that moment of sudden terror, it was clear something had gone terribly wrong. The wormhole was misshapen, and with Oda\'s energy fading, they were going to be lost.

Ryouko dug deep, finding herself all too aware of her soul gem state. It was low; she had just exercised her teleportation to the extreme. But she had been careful to leave herself available for an emergency teleport, and she was still in range.

These were hardly ideal conditions for a teleport. Space‐time was distorted, yes, but she had difficulty conceptualizing how you could make a wormhole *inside* another wormhole.

But she had to try. It might be their only way back.

Ryouko tore away the space‐time surrounding the four of them, even as Oda carried them forward. She wove her magic, reached out for a fraying bit of space‐time the wormhole was expanding into, and something snapped*---

When they emerged again, Oda\'s magic had dispelled, leaving them back as four magical girls in suits, floating in the depths of space.

No... not space. There were no stars. They were still in the larger wormhole.

She was confused at how that was possible, the uncertainty sending her thoughts racing.

The wormhole didn\'t look right. There seemed to be no exit in the darkness, only strange, misshapen patches of light, forming fractal patterns across the face of an implacable, eternal darkness.

*I know about this,* she realized, in a burst of intuition powered partially by Clarisse\'s aid.

There were alternate, low‐probability wormhole geometries that could form, if there was enough energy in the system. Even superpositions. That could easily look like a false opening. But that meant the wormhole wasn\'t stable.

The clarity gave her only temporary relief. The pulsar had surely detonated by now.

*What does \'by now\' even mean?* Clarisse thought. *What reference frame? Are we even still connected to the pulsar? We haven\'t died yet, so surely---*

*Ryouko!*

Ryouko spun in place, twirling in an instinctive burst of telekinesis and suit thrusters.

Impossibly, implausibly, Asami was nearby, behind one of the patches of light, each leading somewhere else in the wormhole. In one of them, a few hundred meters away, she felt a glimmer of Asami\'s magic.

All four of them moved for the opening then, Oda burning her magic in one last burst. In front of them, the opening seemed to spiral wide, piercing the darkness with a ray of hope. Ryouko could even see someone\'s hand reaching through.

Then something slammed into her with cataclysmic force, and all was black.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Ryouko! Ryouko!*

Clarisse\'s voice shocked her awake, and for a moment she was stunned, before starting to panic as her memories set back in. Why couldn\'t she see anything? Where was---

*Oh thank the Goddess, if this isn\'t all her fault,* Clarisse thought. I\'m sorry for waking you out of fugue, but it took me a while to get key systems back online.*

*I, uh, I\'m not sure I like the sound of that,* Ryouko thought, feeling a wave of emotional suppression hit her. *What does that mean?*

*Let me get your optics back on.*

Ryouko was starting to notice something in Clarisse\'s affect she hadn\'t felt before---a layer of careful reserve, a kind of controlled formality.

As her eyes turned back on, she realized what it was---Clarisse was scared.

A powerful wave of emotional suppression then kept her own terror at bay, for the moment.

Her eyes were on, but there was nothing to see but the stars. There was no wormhole, no Adept Blue, nothing else at all.

*Not quite,* Clarisse thought. *The stars are familiar. I ran some astrogation routines. We\'re about twenty‐four light‐minutes from the pulsar.*

Her voice was unsteady for a moment, and Ryouko heard the rest of the story non‐vocally, a story Clarisse had painstakingly pieced back together after the fact.

Something---probably the radiation shockwave from the pulsar---had slammed into them inside the wormhole, in the process dealing the final blow to the wormhole itself. By all rights, that should have killed her, but the geometry of the wormhole had ensured they received only a faint aftershock, and Amane\'s barrier had been up.

Still, it had been enough to knock even a magical girl unconscious, and her body had suffered extensive damage, enough that it was unwise to move.

That wasn\'t even mentioning the fact that she was *marooned*, in hostile space, and the pulsar shockwave *had yet to reach this location*.

Oh, and as far as Clarisse could tell, there was no one else remotely near her.

Given all that, she felt content to lie still in a cloud of addled emotional suppression, rather than think about it too much. Except---

*Why did you even wake me up for this?* Ryouko thought, managing not to sound pained.

*Because the Homura device in your head is going crazy, and I\'d like to know what that\'s about,* Clarisse thought. *It seems very insistent, and clearer this time.*

Ryouko realized then that the pounding in the back of her head wasn\'t just* a distant headache, but rather the same scratching she had felt so many times before, except this time it was rather more like drilling*.

*Can\'t they just leave me alone?* she despaired rhetorically.

She tried to grasp at it, obeying Clarisse\'s request, but it slipped out of her reach, filling her mind with noise.

What was the point? she thought, letting go, and letting her thoughts spin outward.

Simona had been right after all. They had ruined everything, trying this. They should have just gone back. Asami would be devastated.

It all felt stunted, buried beneath a blanket of emotional suppression she left in place. It was better, she decided, to avoid thinking about anything too painful. At least there was an afterlife. That she knew, and while she didn\'t exactly look forward to it... well, at least she would get a chance to ask the Goddess *why the hell*---

She felt what seemed rather like a zap to the back of her mind, and it took her a moment to realize it was Clarisse.

*Please,* Clarisse thought, insistently. *I\'m not going down like this.*

Ryouko didn\'t know how to feel. Ashamed? Clarisse had always been the reasonable one.

She honored that, making another try at interpreting the insistent pounding.

The sensation was hard to grasp, a central impression that her mind refused to shape itself around. Clarisse had been right, though. Something about it was clearer. It didn\'t have the mechanical vibe of what she had felt in the mines\' systems, but more of the natural feeling of the telepathic packet she had gotten from the dead Ceph. She could find scattered information, data that Clarisse was quickly able to parse as relative coordinates, pointing to a representation of a room.

But she still needed to understand the *core*, the glimpses of which seemed like... an expression of intent? Motive?

Then, with all the finesse of a square peg slotting into a round hole, she understood.

She tried desperately, painfully, to hold on to that understanding.

*It\'s... like an artificial emotion of some kind,* she thought. *No, it\'s more like, an explanation of purpose. The impression is...*

She began to look around her, searching for the coordinates she had been given, only a few dozen meters away. At first, she perceived nothing, but then she realized that her soul gem was reacting---*had been reacting---to something from the start: a stealthed FTL engine, close nearby. Alien.

Did she have a choice?

It didn\'t really matter if she trusted the impression of nonviolence she had received, or if she preferred the fighting instinct to take one more enemy down with her. She had to try to live; it was what Asami, what everyone in her life, would want.

She felt something else from the alien ship too, something familiar, and the realization, when it came, was startling: the ship was about to blink. She recognized the technique as similar to her own.

Ryouko blinked aboard the alien ship, and the ship itself blinked away.

Behind her, twenty minutes later, an imploding star showered ruin on the now‐empty void, its beacon blackening forever.

> 〈*In the following text,* 〈〉① *indicates content redacted to those without security clearance. The number indicates the degree of security clearance required to access enclosed content.*〉①
>
> While the growth of the MSY into a unitary global institution has come in hindsight to take on the glow of inevitability---a simple story that has charmed politician and popular historian alike---detailed examination of the historical record suggests plenty of reason for skepticism.
>
> Yes, the MSY was the first magical polity organized along \"modern\" late industrial corporatist‐bureaucratic) lines, but it was not expanding into a purely Hobbesian wilderness of untamed savages. The pre‐MSY world was streaked through with local organizations, ranging in size from a couple dozen to hundreds of members. Typically confined geographically to a distinct locale like a city or an island, these included everything from small, informal aid associations to extensive, loosely‐regulated trade councils, to hierarchies dominated by a clique of powerful enforcers, sometimes in the service of one so‐called tyrant.
>
> Such groupings were not always easy to absorb. On paper, the argument was very compelling: the MSY generated huge tangible benefits in grief cube access, money, and plain survival. Less tangible benefits also accrued over time, including access to local elites, education privileges, and exclusive career paths.
>
> But these advantages were only clearly apparent in the MSY core. Outside MSY territory, skepticism abounded, and emissaries attempting to grease palms often found themselves running afoul of cultural differences, local power structures, and frank distrust. Few were willing to give up their independence to a distant and foreign sovereign.
>
> Nor was the MSY as fervently devoted to expansion as many modern readers imagine, especially not during the early years. Political disagreements developed about the scope and nature of potential expansion, and an abortive nationalist movement tried to keep the organization confined to Japan, convinced that expansion would be more trouble than it was worth, or even immoral. This was an argument that was overcome only by the inducements of commerce, continued foreign entanglements, and the expansionist vision of the Founders.
>
> ...
>
> In the end, one of the MSY\'s biggest assets was its benevolent reputation, one which the organization would more and more consciously cultivate over time. Practical and financial inducements weren\'t always enough. Pure strength wasn\'t always enough. Even carefully‐drafted, meticulously‐tailored integration agreements weren\'t always enough.
>
> Rather, the biggest successes were always those who *asked* to join. The bereft teams which had heard of the plentiful conditions. The trade organizations that craved a protected environment to operate in. The downtrodden who wanted to get out of the shadow of a local tyrant. These heard rumors of an organization that could whisk away their problems, just over the horizon, and became the success stories that bred the next generation of positive rumors. Positive rumors that, in time, became positive *media*; surreptitious MSY‐internal news reports and entertainment that were eventually deliberately disseminated outside MSY borders, always heavy in depictions of mages living lives of comfort, travel, and parenthood---cherished dreams in many places.
>
> This *reputation*---originally only the result of idealistic founders---eventually became an overriding constraint on MSY activity. When things were bad, aid had to be given. Blatant, or even not‐so‐blatant coercion had to be carefully concealed. Influence campaigns had to be deniable. In no‐win situations, the MSY absorbed outsized blame. And if one problematic magical girl or team simply refused to listen to reason...
>
> 〈And of course, no such organization could stand to be without its intelligence services, or its deniable actors. The MSY acquired these in the form of the Black Heart, the dramatically‐named organization that would eventually scout out and monitor magical girl activity around the globe, as well as engage in all manner of less savory forms of manipulation. If the MSY was unique, it was perhaps unique only in how *late* it took this step---a luxury of moral purity, maintainable only in the absence of serious foreign threats.〉③
>
> Over time, then, the rosy mid‐expansion reputation of the MSY waned, especially as rival organizations started successfully consolidating regional influence ahead of the MSY\'s arrival, offering comparable benefits alongside local rule. These were typically isolationist---the Caribbean\'s *Sevité Association* and Iran\'s *Magi* were emblematic, decrying perceived MSY imperialism---but a few were growth‐oriented, most notably Europe\'s *Système Magique Cordial*, and the competition led to a global scramble for the weakly‐organized territory that remained.
>
> As these new borders were drawn, it even seemed as if the magical girl world would settle into a multipolar state...

#### *South Korea, October 2067.* 

\"I just want to make a difference. I *wish* to. All of this, all of our suffering, all our experiences. It must all be worth it.\"

Those words resonated in Akiyama Akari\'s ears, the naive utterings of a naive teenager, a lifetime ago.

*Several* lifetimes ago, really.

But even though that naive teenager was long gone, she had a tendency to leap through time to give Akari grief even now, all these years since those words had made her soul gem shine. After all, her wish still hadn\'t come true.

A high‐pitched whine rang in her ears, and she watched on an eyepiece as Captain Han\'s exoskeletal augments drove the battering ram forward. The front gate of the apartment building blew off its hinges instantly, and the TNC auxiliaries dove in, rifles at the ready.

Akari held her breath, tense despite being safely away from the action in an unmarked van outside the complex. She found it hard to watch, the auxiliaries holding terrified civilians at gunpoint.

\"The first floor is clear,\" Han said in her earpiece. \"Get the doctor in here. We have something.\"

The girl next to Akari, Sato Yamanako, began pulling her outside before she could react.

Once, Akari had wondered why the MSY even bothered attaching mundane auxiliaries to Soul Guard raids. One explanation was simple---it made them look like a government operation, an explanation their agents in Seoul would back up if anyone asked. Even better, they could sometimes avoid using magic at all, which made things nice and tidy.

The *other* reason made a lot more sense to her now. They were professionals, often furtively‐recruited ex‐military, and they leavened the massively‐overstretched Soul Guard deployments with experienced, disciplined veterans, complimenting their own pre‐2060 veterans.

Yamanako pulled her into the darkness, using the line of police‐like vehicles to hide them from prying eyes, passing operatives watching the windows and broken‐down doorways, backs bulging with exoskeletal attachments.

Their paperwork was in order, their uniforms were accurate---they looked just like a Special Mission Group operation.

They stepped into the building, and Akari kept her gaze fixed on the route laid out in her eyepiece, nodding silently as she was waved onward by gunmen at each doorway, every person and detail starkly highlighted by magical darkvision---the power had been cut.

Finally, they reached the door Han had summoned her to.

As she understood it, the usual procedure was to clear the entire building before bringing a non‐combat mage like Akari in, but she had impressed upon them the importance of getting in fast as possible---traces of magic could disappear very quickly. Plus, as a magical girl, she wasn\'t exactly helpless, even if she felt a bit out of place at the moment.

*I need you to say focused, Akiyama‐san,* Yamanako said. *Take a breath and tell us what you see.*

Akari took a breath, feeling her body armor rising and falling. She felt embarrassed and ridiculous, being this anxious. She wasn\'t a regular demon hunter, but she had faced danger before. Why did being on this raid unnerve her so?

Her magic gave an answer, as she sensed something... unpleasant in front of her, filling her stomach with twitchy butterflies, just as she heard rapid footstops through the building above her.

She checked her eyepiece to reassure herself: the noise was just auxiliaries and a couple of magical girls, positions marked on her map. There were no hostile contacts yet, magical or otherwise.

She swallowed once, sharply, and surveyed the room in front of her. It was clean and organized to the point of sterility, with a table, a chair, a bed---and a girl lying on that bed, insensate. No windows.

\"Area is clear,\" her earpiece said, in crisp, efficient Korean. "Delphi, you will need more time with the victims?\"

\"Y‐yes,\" Akari said, barely keeping her voice inaudible, relying on the vibration microphone on her larynx.

She stepped forward, casting her gaze down on the woman in front of her. This---this was familiar, and that calmed her.

\"Subject is in her early twenties, and appears unconscious and unresponsive,\" she subvocalized, crouching down to get a better look. "My initial sense is that she has had her energy drained, but not the way a demon would. Telepathic probing suggests mental inertness. I will now apply a contact probe.\"

She reached forward, placing two fingers on the woman\'s forehead, cringing as an unfamiliar magic zapped across her fingers like static from a door handle---if static electricity were malevolent.

\"Subject has significant traces of magic from a magical girl, presumably a soul mage. The record will note that at this time I am the only known MSY soul mage in South Korea. However---\"

*Cut to the chase,* a voice said on her earpiece. *We both know who it was. Seoyun, the Witch.*

Akari let the comment pass. That was Yeseul, the local who had summoned a Soul Guard team to the area. In accordance with a years‐old agreement with the MSY, some of the local teams in Seoul had bartered away commercial access rights in exchange for grief cubes and promises of protection.

That was why they were here.

Akari continued:

\"The damage here is consistent with local reports of a magical girl, known only as Seoyun, who is allegedly capable of draining energy from humans and using them for magic. Subject is currently in a deep coma and does not seem likely to recover without intervention.\"

Akari stopped there, gathering her thoughts. Could it really be possible? Draining energy from humans instead of demons? And could she do the reverse?

*So it\'s just as they said?* Yamanako asked.

Akari nodded.

*Goddamn,* Yamanako thought.

A ping on their eyepieces summoned their attention---Han wanted to speak to them.

\"Come in,\" Yamanako said at the doorway.

Han stepped through a moment later, and Akari had a moment to glance over his appearance---body armor, equipment pouches, and exoskeletal augments combined with an owl‐like headset to give the impression of a soldier who was part robot, even if most of it wasn\'t under the skin.

Next to him stood the much less extensively kitted Takanashi Megumi, whose white and purple magical girl costume was adorned only by an eyepiece, throat microphone and some pouches of equipment.

\"We\'ve cleared the building,\" Han said. \"But it looks like whoever was here has cleared out, and not too elegantly. There\'s a few apartments with leftover contraband, but only mundane stuff. And the girl here.\"

Far too many buildings just like it, and not just in Korea. A vast swathe of people with no work, nothing better to do but languish on government charity and whatever else they could scrounge. The rest of them could do no better but try not to see it.

\"They knew we were coming,\" Megumi said. \"And why would they leave this girl behind? There\'s sloppy and then there\'s *sloppy*. Things don\'t line up.\"

Yamanako turned slightly, looking over the body Akari had just scanned.

\"This doesn\'t *feel* sloppy,\" she said. \"They could have just forgotten she was here, but the room is way too clean if they just forgot about an entire room.\"

\"What are you suggesting? They wanted us to find her?\" Megumi said.

\"I don\'t know,\" Yamanako said. \"Maybe it\'s a threat. Maybe they\'re trying to tell us to come and get them.\"

She turned towards Akari.

\"Based on what you\'ve seen here, could you identify Seoyun if you met her?\"

Akari nodded.

\"Yes, I could. I sensed more than enough magic to recognize her.\"

\"What about from a distance? Long‐range sensing?\"

\"Tough to say,\" Akari said. \"Probably not unless she was doing something that required a lot of magic. I\'ve never met her, after all.\"

\"You think maybe she left a calling card?\" Han suggested. \"Sometimes, syndicates like to let it be known who was involved. Seoyun works with one, so maybe this is a similar idea, designed to intimidate the powered civilians.\"

Magical girls, he meant.

They contemplated the idea for a moment.

\"In the short term, it doesn\'t matter,\" Megumi said. \"They still got away, and we made enough of a racket that they have to know we\'re after them. That\'s not good no matter how you spin it. Looks like you\'ll have to stick around.\"

\"I volunteered for a few weeks anyway,\" Akari said, sighing. \"I was looking forward to doing a little touristing, but I\'m here for a reason.\"

They stepped aside, letting in a pair of medics and an autostretcher. There was little the TNCs could do---it would be up to Akari to find a way to fix her.

\"Well, I hope you know what you\'re in for,\" Megumi said. \"Things can get real bad, real fast.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *South Korea, November 2067.* 

\"I really expected capturing all of you to be a bit harder.\"

Seoyun wasn\'t even using telepathy, feeling free to taunt verbally, and why not? The team they had brought---Megumi, Yamanako, another girl named Ogata, and a pair of local Koreans---lay incapacitated or dead, some of them confined to soul gems around Akari\'s fingers.

Seoyun had outmaneuvered them. While they had tramped around the city for weeks trying to track her down, she had organized a secret conference of the local magical girls. The locals hardly trusted her, but she had turned them against the MSY with a combination of artful lies, unfortunate truths, and subtle magical manipulation. The MSY was trying to take over, she said. They were sending a wave of foreign magical girls to seize the city, aided by traitors in their midst.

And right in the middle of this conference, an MSY task force had showed up to raid an apartment complex where a well‐liked healer with anti‐MSY tendencies lived. Unlike prior raids, it had turned into a fight, one that left the healer dead.

That news had been broken to Seoyun\'s gathering in the most dramatic way possible, allowing her to all but declare war on the MSY. Attacks on MSY‐aligned teams and businesses began almost immediately, bolstered by Seoyun\'s criminal allies, whom she had cultivated via tales of the fates of the Yakuza and Triads.

The violence spread out over several kilometers of the city, overwhelming MSY reinforcements and auxiliaries. The head of the Soul Guard herself, Tomoe Mami, who had been in Seoul for an unusually long time at this point, was sucked into the fighting---much to Akari\'s benefit, saving her neck in the nick of time.

Then, at Mami\'s suggestion, they had aimed straight for Seoyun.

Now Akari herself was helpless, confined in a cocoon of magic ribbons, only her head exposed. The only thing she could do was look into the eyes of the girl who had trapped her.

Not Seoyun, at least not directly. No, the girl whose soul Seoyun had co‐opted, Mami herself.

Was this how she would die? Her wish unfulfilled, at the hands of one of the MSY\'s own? How painfully meaningless.

Akari gritted her teeth, trying to focus, despite everything.

\"How did she get to you, Tomoe‐san?\" she asked, hoping to buy time, or a hint towards escape. \"We knew her soul corruption spread like a contagion, but who got to you? Was it before we even met?\"

Keeping Mami under control was no small matter---Akari could see the strain it was putting on Seoyun, despite her cocky facade. She could also see that Mami, as old as she was, was already in the process of breaking free. Seoyun probably couldn\'t sustain it for much longer.

Akari flinched as Seoyun\'s sword pressed itself into her neck, cold steel a hairsbreadth away from slicing it open.

\"You\'re not going to talk your way out of this,\" Seoyun said. \"Why make this harder than it has to be?\"

\"What do you want?\" Akari asked.

\"Your consent,\" Seoyun said. \"Don\'t bother pretending you don\'t know what I\'m talking about. Give me your power willingly, and the end will be quick. Otherwise---well, have you ever wondered what it\'s like to be tortured by a soul mage? I\'ve got *endless* creativity.\"

Akari struggled to resist a wave of panic, clenching her jaw to keep from showing any weakness. Magical girls could resist torture by hiding in their soul gem, and while a soul mage like Seoyun could counter that, Akari was a soul mage too, and fighting Akari on her own ground would strain Seoyun\'s ability to keep Mami under control. Seoyun knew all this as well as Akari did. As long as Akari called Seoyun\'s bluff---

Akari screamed as pain pierced into her side, too sudden for her to immediately shut it out.

\"I\'m impatient,\" Seoyun said. \"And I\'m not going to wait any longer.\"

Seoyun pulled her sword out of Akari, then slid it back in between another set of ribs. Akari choked on her own blood as, from the corner of her eye, she saw Mami\'s head twitch slightly. Despite the pain, hope blossomed in her heart.

\"Is this all?\" Akari spat. Mami\'s face was impassive, but Akari could sense a quiet pulse of magic emanating from her. She needed to keep Seoyun distracted. \"And here I thought we were equals as soul mages. Guess I was wrong.\"

Seoyun\'s lip curled.

\"Don\'t tempt me,\" she said. \"*I* didn\'t spend my whole life in cushy business towers.\"

Akari felt a hand push through the hole in her side, magic sparking---she squeezed her eyes shut, doing her best to focus her own magic on Mami, instead of countering Seoyun\'s attack. She needed to make it look like she was in agony as she failed to resist her.

It wasn\'t that hard, to be honest. The screams of pain were real.

The ribbons that bound Akari were Mami\'s magical constructs, up until now relatively inert. But they were changing, filling with traces of Mami\'s soul, just enough that Akari could touch it.

She made contact, letting the world slip away as she reached into the other girl\'s soul and sought out the kernel of Seoyun\'s influence, the darkness in the core of the gem.

It only took a few seconds.

Seoyun\'s head snapped around as she noticed what was going on, and she summoned a sword in each hand, one to cut the connection between them, the other to slice through Akari\'s soul.

Both hands were blown apart before they got there, blood spraying onto the ground, clinging to the ribbons, and metal of the muskets that had done the deed.

*How?* Seoyun thought, as she stumbled forward onto the ground. *You only had* seconds---

Gleaming gunmetal blew off her head, Mami\'s hand grasping her soul gem seconds later.

Akari was free then to fall limp, clutching at the wound in her side. Despite everything, she felt triumph. Her life would have more acts. She still had a chance to matter.

*Akari! Are you okay?* Mami thought, hurrying to her. More ribbons were already threading out to support Akari, the gold strands warm with Mami\'s true self.

Akari could only smile wanly as the other girl healed her. She *hadn\'t freed Mami from Seoyun\'s control that quickly. She had simply, with Mami\'s own assistance, turned its focus toward Akari herself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, once Akari truly dispelled the effect, the whole affair became a bit embarrassing, though Mami seemed to take it in surprising stride, turning her attention immediately to stabilizing the situation.

With Seoyun\'s influence gone, the fighting cooled, though there was no getting rid of the very real casualties---or the very real feelings that Seoyun had used to drive the conflict in the first place. It took nearly half an hour to put together a ceasefire and soul gem exchange, driven partly by the arrival of serious government force.

Amidst the chaos and pressure, it was a while before Akari began to grasp the magnitude of what had happened. Indeed, it didn\'t begin to fully dawn on her until they limped back to base, watching news reports on their eyepieces detailing the uncontrolled violence and exotic banned weaponry.

\"This is a disaster,\" Mami said, shaking her head. \"We\'re already asking the Incubators to help us with that cover‐up. Heads will roll.\"

She was ostensibly addressing the entire crew but looking at her.

\"Is it really that bad?\" someone asked. \"This was a poor neighborhood. There\'s incidents all the time. Why can\'t we play it down?\"

\"They\'re still people!\" Mami said, voice shrill. \"We can\'t play down something like this!\"

She paused for a moment.

\"The politicians will have to care about something like this, whether they want to or not. The damage is too extensive to be a normal incident, and the Korean media is *already* all over it. Whatever story they come up with, someone will be held accountable. The Soul Guard will be held accountable.\"

She turned towards Akari.

\"And you\'ll be at the center of it.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Akari wanted out. She wanted to go back to Japan.

She had signed on to work with the Soul Guard because she wanted to feel like she was improving things. Instead, the work was frustrating and demoralizing, something epitomized by the conflict with Seoyun. Akari had tried to stop her, and people had gotten killed. What had it really achieved in the end?

On top of that, the incident was now being trumpeted as a possible terrorist attack by North Korea and was making waves in the international news, with attention coming in from both Mitakihara and foreign mundane capitals. Special response teams were en route to sift through the evidence, mediate with the local government, and work the political situation with the local magical girls.

As Mami had promised, that meant she was the girl of the hour, whether she liked it or not, though they promised her role in events would be kept out of BakeNewsko, the MSY media arm.

That helped, a little, but her reputation was only part of her concern.

After the first set of interrogators---a combination of suave career TNCs and less‐than‐polite Guild telepaths---she was given a break to chew quietly on a sandwich, and then Mami stepped into the room.

The others stepped out of the room, and when the door closed, Mami set down a plate of cookies, evidently intended for her.

Akari wasn\'t sure what to say. Was now the time to admit that she had touched quite a bit of Mami\'s soul? She had spent more time with Mami than the others.

She took a breath to steady herself, deciding she would pass on the cookies for now.

It was very tempting to try and read Mami\'s mind, but Akari knew better. If she was caught, it would look awful.

\"I assume you\'ve already been briefed on what I told the others,\" Akari said. \"Besides, you were there.\"

\"That\'s one way of putting it,\" Mami said.

Akari studied Mami\'s expression, trying to glean what she could. She seemed worried.

It was hard not recontextualizing this within what she now knew about Mami. It felt like a violation to even have such thoughts, but... she couldn\'t avoid knowing that if she were Mami, she would most fear anyone learning about her insecurities.

Was that what this was about, then?

She swallowed, as subtly as she could manage. It seemed so prosaic, with the disasters going on around them, with the international media speculating about war, to be worried about something like that. Surely Mami would be focused on something else?

\"Well, I\'m, uh, curious why you would choose to visit me,\" Akari said, realizing that she had let the silence stretch on far too long. "There\'s not much else to talk about.\"

Mami tapped a finger against the table, then picked up a cookie, staring at it for a moment before setting it aside on a napkin.

\"I don\'t like having this conversation,\" Mami said. \"But I do think it\'s important I do this, rather than some security agent. You see, intrusion into the mindspace of a Director‐level mage isn\'t just a personal issue, it\'s also an issue of organizational security. That\'s why it\'s a very good thing we were able to capture Seoyun, in the end.\"

Akari kept her face frozen.

\"I know Seoyun saw something. I know *you* saw something. That\'s what the documentation on soul mages says. You\'re not in trouble, but we need to know what you know, what *she* might know, and what kind of lingering influence might remain. We need to know the details of what you did to me.\"

Mami paused, then sucked in a breath.

\"And I\'m personally responsible here, you know. This was the highest‐level mindjack in MSY history. I\'d consider submitting my resignation, if I thought there was any chance it\'d be accepted. As it is, I need to take responsibility.\"

Akari stared into the other girl\'s eyes, and found herself briefly transfixed.

The memories were a jumble in her mind. More than anyone, Tomoe Mami was surrounded by friends, colleagues, juniors. It shouldn\'t have been possible for her to feel isolated. And yet, Mami had spent so long searching her own eyes.

\"It was an emergency,\" Akari said. \"I had to move quickly, and countering Seoyun directly would have been risky. So I figured out what she was doing. Very common, for this kind of thing. She made you fall in love with her.\"

She paused, trying to keep her face impassive.

\"It\'s harder than it sounds. It takes a lot to strip away all the layers of complexity a soul builds up over a lifetime, and focus everything on a simple, primordial emotion. But, since she had basically done all the work already, I was able to just... co‐opt it. Make you love me instead. It helped that your loyalties already pointed in the right direction.\"

She stopped talking, realizing that she was starting to ramble. Mami looked pensive, worried, disturbed.

\"I thought it was something like that,\" she said. \"I remember what it felt like.\"

\"It\'s normal to feel some lingering feelings,\" Akari said, answering the question Mami hadn\'t asked yet. \"Some of the thought patterns can persist afterward.\"

*Especially if they feel natural,* she appended mentally, but did not say.

Mami stared at her for a few seconds, and she could see the traces of vulnerability around her eyes. It was difficult to ignore.

\"That\'s it, though?\" Mami asked. \"No other effects, other than, uh, being a bit attracted to you for a while?\"

Akari cringed. A part of her enjoyed the notion, but knowing that it was all a magic effect...

\"Well, I saw some core memory impressions,\" Akari admitted. \"Nothing really sensitive, mostly childhood memories, emotional events. I could go over them with you, if you wanted.\"

She *really* didn\'t want to. There was no good way to tell anyone that she had seen the terror of nearly dying in a car crash, or the pain of seeing one\'s home destroyed.

Mami took a deep breath.

\"No, not right now,\" she said. \"I think I have to, though. But if you promise there\'s nothing that\'s a security risk, we can wait a bit. I can schedule something.\"

\"That\'d be nice,\" Akari found herself blurting out.

She watched Mami get up and walk away, staring even after the door had closed.

Then she ate a cookie.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Akari was released into the city shortly thereafter, with the strict admonition that, in the wake of what was now called the Songpa incident, MSY members should not leave the MSY sector of the city---a few square blocks laid aside for corporate branch offices and non‐mundane trade activities.

After what had happened, Akari was initially happy to oblige. She felt no desire to expose herself to danger again, and imagined herself happy to retreat to her comfy hotel room.

Days passed however, and she changed her mind. The MSY sector was nice, clean, and corporate, which meant it had none of the night markets, roadside restaurants, or bars she had grown used to. There wasn\'t even a place with a good view of the river! As a magical girl, she had enjoyed weaving across the rooftops of the city, children screaming and food grilling below, stopping occasionally to chat with a local hunting party leaning on their weapons. Now, she was stuck in a box, the empty meeting room of Seoul.

So she and her surviving colleagues dined in the local high‐end establishments, looking out over a city of lights they couldn\'t visit. It seemed inappropriate in the wake of what had happened, especially with Yamanako\'s soul gem still in a facility in Mitakihara, being attached to someone else\'s cadaver.

When the time came, she attended a somber ceremony for the dead---mostly non‐magical---and found herself with Ogata and Megumi, an invisible social wall separating them from the TNCs. Han had been the father of two kids, it seemed. The MSY would provide for them well.

Mami had already returned to Japan. That was a shame---she would have definitely been at the event.

Afterward, they retired to a lounge. They had discussed finding something else to do, maybe some karaoke, or some time in the spa, or even doing one of those \"multisensual food experiences\" the kids were into these days. Nothing appealed.

Instead, they drank, and Akari remembered to call her mom, who had been frantically trying to reach her again after hearing yet another rumor of a North Korean terrorist attack.

The lounge was members‐only, and Akari perked up when someone changed the channel on the TV panel from standard---full of giant heads engaged in heated speculation about new tensions with North Korea---to MSY‐gov. Normally about as interesting as listening to an Incubator, it seemed the Rules Subcommittee on Crime and Enforcement was holding a hearing on the Songpa incident, and was about to call none other than Tomoe Mami to testify.

The chatter in the lounge died down, and the barkeeper enlarged the panel, allowing its holography to stretch over a meaningful chunk of the wall. The committee room was high‐level corporate Masters of the Universe, with big paneled windows and leather chairs, but still arranged so that it was obvious who was interviewing whom.

\"Our next guest I believe needs no introduction,\" the woman seated in the center said, the text \"Takara Emi, Chair\" briefly appearing over her head.

Mami appeared in‐scene a moment later, taking a seat behind an electronic display helpfully emblazoned \"Tomoe Mami, Soul Guard Director\", stylized to look like paper.

Mami\'s eyes darted around the room, the recognizable gesture of someone turning on a pair of information contacts.

\"I take it you know why we called you here?\" Emi asked, leaning forward.

\"Of course. The Songpa Incident,\" Mami said, face level.

Emi nodded, then leaned back, preparing to speak.

\"A great tragedy, and a blemish on the reputation of our organization. The MSY prides itself on its competence and professionalism, qualities which were *not* evident on the ground here. Despite the recommendations of the recent working group...\"

Akari could feel her attention slipping, and turned her attention to her drink. There was a reason no one really enjoyed watching these: a substantial portion of the time would be devoted to the committee members, and indeed Mami herself, establishing their political positions and signaling to the masses.

The issue and surrounding controversies were divisive enough that it behooved every civic‐minded magical girl to know the basics: the MSY now had business interests around the pacific rim, and bartered relationships with the local magical girl groups---freedom to operate and local assistance---in exchange for provisions of grief cubes and hard cash. That was the standard arrangement, though there were several exceptions, China being the most important.

From Akari\'s point of view, there were two main camps. One side, the Nationalists---though they *hated* being called that, preferring "Japanists\"---wanted to keep the MSY a Japanese affair, with no foreign entanglements other than what was necessary for strictly financial reasons.

The other side---which included most of the business community, as well as old guard luminaries like Tomoe Mami and Akemi Homura---argued that blocking MSY expansion incurred huge financial and moral costs, and didn\'t even prevent foreign entanglements to boot.

The Nationalists had been dominant once. In 2059 they had even managed to make their approach part of the Charter.

But then the warnings started coming true. MSY Finance was hobbled overseas, resentment and mistrust brewed from China to Peru, and the Soul Guard continued to get dragged into foreign scuffles, stuck honoring old promises of protection.

So, policy had loosened a little, things got more complicated, Soul Guard deployments got larger, MSY corporations invested more overseas, entire cities started needing protection and---

---well, somewhere on the other end of that, the MSY\'s contradictory approach had triggered an incident so big, so *violent* that the Incubators had to help pass it off as a possible attack by North Korea. The one she had just been a part of.

Akari\'s attention perked up, as she saw Mami straighten in her seat and prepare to speak.

\"Speaking for the Soul Guard, we all regret what happened,\" Mami said. "This incident is already the subject of an inquiry by the Executive Inspector, and our training and procedures will be revised accordingly. The fact of the matter is, both the special relations team and the response teams reacted according to established protocol, and behaved commendably when confronted with a dangerous situation involving hostile adversaries. It is a testament to the skill and professionalism of the officers that we suffered only a few permanent losses, though we regret considerably that we were unable to prevent extensive mundane damage or serious losses in the auxiliary detachments. In addition, we regret the losses we needed to inflict on the local magical girl population.\"

It sounded convincing to Akari, for politician‐speak, and she knew, better than almost anyone, that Mami meant most of it. She was proud of her officers, and hated losses on either side.

But it didn\'t seem to convince anyone else. For instance, the first Representative to respond complained that Mami\'s use of the term "adversaries\" revealed an adversarial mindset when it came to foreign magical girls, the most forced argument Akari had ever heard.

The rest of the session was little better, leaving Akari with little sympathy for either side, at least in a political sense.

\"Meaningless,\" she said, when it was all over and Mami had stepped out of the room. No decisions had been made and no lessons learned. Instead, both sides had raked Mami and the Soul Guard over the coals, for being simultaneously too soft and too hardline. And yet there wasn\'t even any threat that Mami would be removed---her position on the Executive Committee was elected, Founders were nearly impossible to unseat, and division head removals were controlled by the Leadership Committee.

\"Even so,\" Ogata said, looking at her askance. \"It might not be a big deal to you, but it\'s a big deal to all of us stationed out here. And you saw what it\'s like out here, for the rest of the world. There\'s a reason it\'s *the* biggest political issue.\"

Akari ducked her head, suitably chastened.

\"I just hate that we\'re not getting anything done. All we\'re doing is arguing, and half the time we\'re just making everything worse. Seoul was fine until we came here.\"

\"You\'d prefer Seoyun was still active?\" Ogata asked. \"We rooted her out. And I\'d hardly call Seoul fine. Have you seen how poor some of these girls live? We made things better.\"

\"Did we? Maybe, but it sure seemed like her whole plan was just to get to me,\" Akari said. \"So all those people died for what?\"

\"You\'re not making sense,\" Megumi said. \"The drinks are going to your head.\"

Akari started to retort, then bit her lip.

They were right. She wasn\'t making sense. She just... didn\'t know what she was doing out here.

She ordered another drink.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Japan, December 2067.* 

For a while, especially after she returned from Korea, Akari began to think that Mami had forgotten about meeting with her---or, perhaps, chosen to forget. It would have been understandable.

Just as she was starting to give up hope, Mami contacted her, calling her in person in the midst of lunch with her elderly parents.

Mami asked her to meet in the financial district, in one of the D&E skyscrapers, known internally as Executive Tower, because it housed the administrative staffs of several Executive Divisions.

Here the city was clean, bright, and tastefully decorated, with the cuisines of the world around every corner. Everyone tried to live here, if they could.

The impossibly clear doors to the tower slid open at her approach, and she ran her ID past a scanner at the security checkpoint, nodding at the guard. It wasn\'t that they didn\'t have biometrics---but who knew what magic was capable of? It was just harder to fabricate biometrics *and* a physical ID.

That wasn\'t all the security, either. A few meters later, she turned into the elevator area, then found a discreet alcove on the side. There, she summoned her soul gem for a fraction of a second, the spectrometer taking its readings.

*That* gave a magical girl the authorization to continue onward. Supposedly, the Division Heads themselves were subject to even more scrupulous checks, though they entered via their own private garage.

Akari entered her floor into the panel, waited for approval, then stepped into the special elevator, joining a couple of other girls and TNCs wrapped up in their own business.

She reflected on the anxiety she should be feeling. Anxiety about meeting one of the most important people in the magical girl world. Anxiety about her own place in that world. Anxiety for Mami herself.

Somehow she felt only a tinge of it. It was not what she would have expected.

Akari stayed in the elevator even as the others gradually peeled away, replaced by other staffers. Even at the higher levels of the bureaucracies, TNCs were inevitable---those with elite talent in fields where magic wasn\'t much of an asset.

Eventually the elevator cleared out, and she let out a breath of relief to be alone, until the doors opened and someone she recognized stepped in, accompanied by the distinctive whiff of cinnamon.

Akari couldn\'t help but tense visibly, especially when the woman leaned over, giving her a once‐over.

\"Relax. I\'m not going to bite. Here.\"

The woman with the long ponytail dug into the large paper bag she was carrying, pulling out a smaller bag filled with half a dozen churros.

\"Here, from the shop two blocks down. Need to get them to her anyway. Don\'t tell her I got these. Have fun.\"

Somehow, the woman timed it perfectly, stepping back out onto a different floor and disappearing around the corner.

Then Akari was there, and as she stepped outside, she felt the distinctive poke of someone attempting a telepathic screening. She let them in, just a bit, then slid the door shut when they were done. They were just doing their jobs, she thought.

And whatever it was Sakura Kyouko had intended, she felt it would be best to go along with it.

She looked around as she walked, taking in the glass windows and subdued statuary, replete with hidden symbolism. Maybe there\'d be time to take a deeper look later.

She glanced at the timestamp in her contacts, then opened the door.

Mami was already getting up, headed for her.

\"Ah, Akiyama‐san, good to see you. Oh, you didn\'t have to bring anything. Hmm.\"

Akari handed over the churros awkwardly, frozen by Kyouko\'s admonition not to say anything.

\"I, uh, happened across them,\" she said.

Akari made a small show of looking around the room, hoping to dodge more questions. It hardly looked like an office at all, with a side table on both sides surrounded by plush chairs and decorations, perhaps intended for group meetings.

And indeed, rather than leading her to the central desk, Mami led her to one of the tables, where there was a tray of candies.

Mami set the churros next to the tray, pointed enticingly towards Akari.

\"Would you like a drink? I thought about having tea ready, but I didn\'t want to assume. Maybe some hot chocolate? I know that sounds really rich, but what\'s being a magical girl if we can\'t indulge once or twice?\"

\"That, uh, sounds lovely,\" Akari said.

Mami tapped the order into a pad on the table.

\"You don\'t have to do all this,\" Akari said, raising her hands. "I\'m just, uh.\"

She didn\'t finish the sentence, realizing that this didn\'t make sense. She was just here to tell Mami about what memories she had seen. That didn\'t exactly entail getting royal treatment.

\"Well, I don\'t know how to start this conversation,\" she said, finally. \"We\'re here to talk about what parts of you I saw. I saw a fair few.\"

She kept her gaze firmly on the table.

\"You\'ve always been lonely, though you try not to show it. Ever since your parents died way back when. You still wonder if you and Sakura Kyouko could have ever been a thing. You\'re worried about Akemi Homura---you think something\'s wrong with her, but you don\'t know how to talk to her about this. And uh, I\'m not going to say the part about Chitose Yuma. I think you get the gist of it.\"

She looked up, and found Mami\'s smile a little brittle.

\"You know, I\'m glad you didn\'t mention that in our previous meeting,\" Mami said. \"If that had gone on the record---well, just think of all the blackmail you\'re capable of.\"

\"I suppose,\" Akari said, looking the other woman in the eye. She didn\'t look angry or worried; there was something else in there.

\"I would never share anything like that,\" she said, finally. \"We soul mages have enough suspicion on us already. Whatever rules the Telepaths\' Guild has on this still apply to me.\"

\"I know,\" Mami said, smile less brittle now. \"I\'m not worried about that. But now that you\'re here, recent events have made me realize that we\'re woefully unprepared against soul mages. The senior leadership have all had anti‐telepathy training, but this is something very different, isn\'t it?\"

\"It is,\" Akari said. \"But I think you\'re overestimating the threat. Soul mages are very rare, and by and large, manipulating a person\'s soul is not as easy as reading their mind. It\'s not any easier, and isn\'t that different from standard mind‐control.\"

For once, Akari was on familiar ground.

\"I disagree,\" Mami said. \"Just because it\'s rare or difficult doesn\'t mean it\'s not a weakness. Not when the downside risk of a failure could be catastrophic. Then we have to defend against it anyway.\"

\"I guess I can\'t argue with that. Are you proposing I set up some kind of training program?\"

\"Something like that.\"

Mami looked down into her lap, then back up again, meeting Akari\'s gaze.

\"There\'s something else, though,\" she said.

Akari waited for Mami to elaborate, growing increasingly uncomfortable as the seconds ticked by and Mami hesitated, face working.

Akari felt herself tense up. If something was tongue‐tying someone as old as Mami...

\"Um, what?\" she asked, finally.

She studied the woman\'s expression. Like before, something was different there.

\"Well, I,\" Mami began. \"I know you said there\'d be lingering feelings. I *really* thought about that, and I waited. But you know, it felt *nice*. I kind of miss it.\"

It took Akari a few seconds to realize what was being said, and then she froze in place, feeling a blush crawl its way up her neck.

\"I, um---\"

She had tried very hard not to think of Mami that way, deliberately avoiding the thought whenever it came up. It was a ridiculous notion, after all.

But now... well, Mami couldn\'t mean anything else, could she?

\"Are you sure?\" she finally asked, managing to contain her emotions for the moment. \"The aftereffects can be very strange. It can help to ask someone you trust. Have you tried talking to Sakura‐san?\"

*No, what the heck was that?* she thought to herself. Flustered, she had disgorged a set of meaningless, half‐remembered mind‐control recovery advice. It was hardly relevant to the situation.

\"I have,\" Mami said. \"I did my research, I asked the right people to get tested. I even talked to Sakura‐san.\"

She paused, closing her eyes and shaking her head, a small smile coming to her lips as she seemed to replay a memory in her mind.

\"I... wouldn\'t have ventured to ask if I didn\'t think you might be receptive. I hope it doesn\'t offend you that I looked into your background a bit.\"

\"Not at all,\" Akari said, dazedly.

\"Then what do you say?\" Mami asked, eyes soft.

It was quite a question to be confronted with suddenly. She had hardly been looking for a relationship, with her life as unsettled as it was. She had tried her hand at charity work, in the MHD, and now with the Soul Guard, and she had all but decided to reset her career once again after Seoul. She had lived out of hotel rooms for years now.

But did someone like Mami even care about things like that?

She couldn\'t say she returned the confession---not quite, not yet. Still...

\"I wouldn\'t mind trying something,\" she said. \"Though, goodness, um, I don\'t know what to say.\"

Mami\'s eyes lit up.

\"Well, are you busy? I still have plenty on my schedule, but we could maybe do dinner.\"

Akari wasn\'t busy. She was still on standby for the Soul Guard.

\"I could do that.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things moved quickly from there. It seemed a bit unseemly, but after a few days she grew used to visiting Executive Tower, having a meal with Mami, and just chatting, with the occasional foray into teaching Mami about soul manipulation.

Akari found herself dreading her next Soul Guard summons, then feeling guilty about it. It was a familiar pattern---her personality, or perhaps her wish, did not permit her to relax for long, even after she had inevitably lost faith in her current line of work.

So this time, now that she had lost faith in Soul Guard contracting, she would resign, unless her skills were irreplaceable for the next assignment. It was probably for the best, anyway---she didn\'t want to damage Mami\'s reputation if it ever came out that she was seeing a subordinate.

The summons came soon enough: she was to appear at an unfamiliar address in Kazamino.

A short train ride took her into the city center, on the inner edge of shrinking Mitakihara. Here, the MSY\'s presence was represented by a few large office complexes, corporate outposts of the most generic kind.

She found her way into one, scanning her ID at the door and her soul gem at the security desk. Then she found her way to the right conference room and waited; the message had been vague at best about why she was here, but she was used to that. Soul mage work could rarely be referred to directly.

She settled in, grabbing water from the side counter, then synchronizing her phone with the room. She checked the calendar, then her update feed, then sent a few messages to her parents.

And when she finally ran out of things to do, she stared at the ceiling for a long time, feeling the comings and goings of the soul gems around her, eavesdropping on the edges of thought clouds, fantasizing about being back at the tower.

This close to HQ, it was doubtful she would be dealing with anything like Seoyun. More likely, she was being asked to help with an ugly case---a girl with a soul‐draining power, perhaps, or an unusual type of trauma. Nothing pleasant, but nothing personally dangerous. Probably.

Finally, the door opened and she looked down, then almost jumped out of her skin.

\"Thanks for waiting,\" Akemi Homura said, an adjutant closing the door behind her. \"My previous meeting ran somewhat late.\"

\"No problem, Akemi‐san,\" Akari said, hollowly. \"I wasn\'t busy.\"

\"Indeed,\" Homura said, placing a paper folder onto the table, along with a cup of coffee, lightly fragrant on the air.

Akari stared for a bit, taking in the notion of the First Executive sitting across from her, rifling through some papers. Up close, she looked entirely ordinary, her incredible flowing hair confined to a ponytail. Yet the atmosphere she projected was completely different from Mami---businesslike, and Akari couldn\'t help but feel uncomfortable, like there was something she had forgotten to do.

\"Indeed, you\'re not busy,\" Homura repeated, without looking up from her notes. \"And that\'s a bit of a problem, isn\'t it? This Soul Guard attaché role isn\'t exactly filling your hours, nor is it giving you satisfaction. It\'s a waste of your abilities.\"

Akari felt compelled to nod. She wouldn\'t have put it in quite those terms, but Homura wasn\'t wrong.

Even if it felt a little like admitting she had been shamefully idle.

Homura clasped her hands together, tilting her head.

\"That\'s why the Executive is establishing a new research initiative, geared specifically towards matters of the soul,\" she said. \"We\'ve decided that the current state of this kind of research is too haphazard, especially for so important a topic. We\'d like to push it more aggressively, and put it under closer Science Division supervision.\"

Homura looked at her, clearly expecting some kind of response, but Akari needed to chew on the topic.

She ducked her head, and tried to figure out what was going on.

\"I\'m not sure exactly what you\'re getting at, to be honest,\" she said. \"You want me to do research? I thought there would be something like this already. I\'d hardly be expert enough.\"

\"That\'s just the thing,\" Homura said, looking her squarely in the eyes. \"It\'s a very important topic. A very *dangerous* topic. We\'ve generally seen fit to pursue a policy of... enlightened neglect.\"

Homura waited a moment, then tapped the folder with a finger, indicating what Akari realized was a picture of *her*, from quite a few years back.

\"You\'re wondering why you. The truth is, we\'ve kept our eyes on you. On all the soul mages, of course, but your reviews have always been quite good, and you\'re *old*. Almost as old as us. That matters.\"

Akari shook her head.

\"But what changed? Why start doing something now?\" Akari asked. \"Was it what happened in Korea?\"

Homura motioned for her to wait as she flipped through her folder.

\"We\'ve gotten too big,\" she said, finally. \"Even the most obscure attack vectors have to be considered. There have been more close calls than we\'ve publicly acknowledged. We can no longer afford mere security through obscurity.\"

She gestured at a sheaf of papers she had pulled out of her folder, then smiled slightly, with more warmth than Akari had thought possible.

\"If you agree to join, you\'d have access. My personal opinion has been that this knowledge is likely to be dangerous, and ripe for abuse, but I have been persuaded that this is now the lesser evil, if under your supervision.\"

Akari tried to think it all through. Why would the First Executive personally* try to recruit her, when she knew Akari was quite ready to take on a different role and shouldn\'t need convincing?

\"What exactly are you asking me to do?\" she asked.

Homura\'s lip quirked slightly.

\"Mami‐san says you have potential as a researcher,\" Homura said. \"You have the right kind of drive, and the right kind of intelligence. So, it would make sense to set you up a bit. Nominally, you\'d answer to Chitose Yuma as Division Head, but in practice, other than the occasional report, you\'ll be free to do your own thing, hire your own people.\"

Akari couldn\'t help but be boggled. Her? Managing people? Doing research? And did Homura know how Mami knew her? Had Mami been involved in this?

\"I know,\" Homura said. \"This isn\'t something you\'re trained for, so we\'ll give you a bit of a mentor. Don\'t worry. Like us, you\'ve had decades of prime adulthood. You\'ll find it makes you far more prepared than you think.\"

Homura didn\'t have to elaborate on what *us* meant.

A thought crossed Akari\'s mind, one she hesitated before voicing.

\"Why aren\'t you setting up some kind of research institute? Something more proper, like the Demonology Center?\"

Homura smiled, and this time the smile chilled rather than warmed.

\"Would you put a dozen very rare, valuable soul mages in one place to do dangerous research?\" Homura asked, smile unbroken. \"I wouldn\'t. Not unless I had to.\"

She pinned Akari with her gaze for a moment, and then the smile faded back into something more normal.

\"Take some time to think about it,\" she said. \"A week, I\'d say. And now...\"

Homura shuffled the paper at her side, bringing another set of documents to the top, neatly clipped together.

\"I\'d like to get to know you a bit better. What is it you want out of life?\"

Akari blinked once, twice, then cleared her throat rhetorically.

\"I, um, well, when I was a girl I wanted to make a difference. With the way things are, all the despair in the world. I didn\'t exactly know what I was bargaining with, but I\'ve tried to stay true to that.\"

She paused, waiting to see if Homura wanted to ask something more. Instead, Homura motioned her to go on.

\"Honestly, I don\'t think I\'ve done that good a job. I\'m sure it says that in your files. Thanks to the MSY I haven\'t had to worry too much about material concerns, but I haven\'t really been satisfied.\"

\"You did some good work for the MHD while you were there,\" Homura commented. \"Why did you quit?\"

Akari took a breath, a few old images automatically flashing through her mind.

\"It was too stressful,\" she said. \"And I don\'t think I was doing very well. My cases ended poorly.\"

\"You got some of the hardest cases,\" Homura said. \"I don\'t think that\'s fair to yourself.\"

Akari swallowed.

\"But no one could blame you for leaving,\" Homura said, before she had to say anything. \"You had some similar successes with the Soul Guard, including this recent incident in Korea.\"

\"I would hardly call that a success,\" Akari said, so relieved at the topic change that she spoke too quickly.

\"Your involvement was a net positive,\" Homura said.

She closed her folder, then stood up, stretching a hand out for Akari to shake. Akari stared at it a moment, surprised both by the non‐Japanese gesture and the abruptness at which their conversation had ended. Had she said something wrong?

She shook Homura\'s hand.

\"I look forward to seeing what you\'re capable of,\" Homura said, nodding. \"Both in the lab and with... my friend. She could use someone, I think.\"

Akari was too shocked to interrupt, and Homura continued:

\"*She*\'s a lot more vulnerable than she looks. I think you know that. Take good care of her. It means a lot to me.\"

Then Homura turned on her heels and left.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Akari accepted the offer.

She had known she would from the very beginning. Just like everything before it, the Soul Guard posting had failed to grab her, failed to elicit in her more than a sense of inadequacy. She had wanted to save the world from despair and *this* was all she was doing?

Her mother would have told her to settle---*had* told her to settle. She had told her that not everyone was destined to make big waves, and maybe her wish was trying to make her difference in a small way.

She couldn\'t bring herself to believe that, and so she found herself on yet another career path, riding an autocab out into Mitakihara Old Town.

Old Town was not called that for its historical architecture or its nostalgia. The term was brutally literal, referring to a sector of the city filled with empty, depopulated buildings that no one had ever paid to demolish.

There had been a few half‐hearted efforts by the city and various NGOs to make use of the area for parks, markets, and open space. Some had even been successful. But no one Akari knew ever ventured anywhere out of those few successes. As far as she knew, it was a den of drug labs, homeless squatters, and shifty operations which preferred isolation to amenities and easy access.

What she was doing fell into the last category. Working with grief cubes and soul gems was not just worth hiding, it was also potentially dangerous*, especially to civilian populations. Isolation was simply good policy.

She knew all that, and she was still unprepared for what awaited her when her cab doors swung open and she could see something other than her tinted windows.

The streets were barren and the sidewalks overgrown. The mid‐rise office buildings around her were in no better shape, sporting faded signage, cracked edifices, and broken windows. What trees there were had grown huge and misshapen, ripping apart the pavement.

There was a peculiar kind of silence---the chirping of birds, the distant sound of wind, the clattering noise of a vagabond pushing a cart down the road two blocks away, thankfully not in her direction. The air smelled a mix of nature and dust.

The building in front of her looked no better than the rest. Only careful inspection revealed a set of concealed cameras, and that the doorway looked recently used and a bit too clean.

It was all rather unpromising.

\"Not a bad place,\" Mami said, looking up the side of the building. "Plenty of space. Depends what\'s inside.\"

To her surprise, the door opened immediately when she tried to open it, registering her metrics like any good modern system. She had expected, perhaps, a soul gem scan.

Instead, she found herself staring down a magical girl just behind the doorway, whose magic danced over her skin as she passed. Was *that* the real security?

\"This isn\'t a core facility,\" Mami whispered, leaning over. \"Out here, it pays to be careful, and the only real security comes from magical girls. Though we have the basic mundane security.\"

In the atrium was a small arrangement of chairs leading to an empty security desk, behind which were the hallways and staircases that led into the rest of the building. This was the waiting area.

A pair of young women were standing five feet behind the guard, and it took Akari a moment to register the soul gem signatures, then that she hadn\'t* noticed them any sooner. It took lots of skill to hide that well, especially from her. Moreover, why would anyone bother?

\"Sadachi Shiori,\" the one in front said, bowing politely. \"I\'ve been asked to get you started around here.\"

She hesitated a bit, glancing at her companion, and then Mami piped up.

\"Yuma‐chan. I didn\'t expect you to be here.\"

\"I\'m just here to observe, Mami‐nee‐san.\"

Akari\'s anxiety level spiked---*this* was the Science Division head? Akari hadn\'t been told she would be visiting.

She took a long look. Chitose Yuma was tall, fresh‐faced, with none of the hard edges Homura displayed so prominently. That belied expectations.

\"Please don\'t be nervous,\" Yuma said, shaking her head, long hair fluttering in the air. \"I just wanted to get out of my office a bit, see the rollout for myself. I won\'t be evaluating anything.\"

She seemed friendly enough, Akari supposed.

Shiori gestured Akari forward, and they made their way up the stairs. The first floor was intended for office space and lunch areas. The upper floors were where any work would be carried out, behind an array of glass doors.

Shiori showed them through a few of the rooms, where there were countertops laid out in parallel columns like a real research lab. Akari recognized much of the equipment: spectrometers for gem emission measurements, a custom photometer for corruption measurement---still an inexact science, at best---and a set of grief containment vessels. The last could have easily been mistaken for elaborately‐ornamented glass cloches, but Akari had seen their like before. There was a specialist in the MSY somewhere who made these, no two alike, the glass streaked through with patterns of color and sometimes brass.

\"So have you decided what you want to do?\" Shiori asked, when they seated themselves into her new office.

\"I poked around a bit in the files I was sent,\" Akari said. \"There\'s been a lot of research into complex soul manipulation, enchantment and the like, but not very much into fundamental topics like corruption, the soul‐body link, the despair spiral. I want to start there, from the basics.\"

Suddenly, she felt Yuma staring at her from the corner of the room.

\"There\'s a good reason that hasn\'t been studied,\" Mami said, clasping her hands in front of her face. \"All of that requires subjecting mages to unpleasant, or even dangerous conditions. Just an unfriendly field of study.\"

Akari shook her head.

\"But very important,\" she said. \"That\'s the kind of thing that would make a real difference. Imagine if we learned how to suspend a despair spiral, or stretch grief cubes a bit longer. I know that\'s treading on Incubator ground, but that would save lives.\"

Mami\'s look made her uncomfortable, so she appended:

\"It\'s also dangerous to us as a group not to know what is possible. The magical girl in Korea, Seoyun---her abilities worked by interacting with corruption somehow. We have to know.\"

\"It\'s a pretty good point,\" Yuma said, leaning against the wall. "The potential benefits are quite high. Provided the knowledge isn\'t misused.\"

Akari was starting to sense that there was more going on here than met the eye, but also that she probably shouldn\'t ask.

\"There will be plenty of supervision,\" Mami said, looking at Yuma.

\"There\'s some old research on the subject from back before the moratorium,\" Yuma said. \"I\'ll send you the documentation. It\'s going to be heavily redacted, though. Not a very savory source. Mami‐nee‐san, let\'s speak outside for a bit.\"

The two of them stepped out, probably for a telepathy session that would have been impolite to have in front of others.

*I wonder what that was about,* Shiori thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Do you think she\'ll be alright?* Mami thought, shaking her head.

*If I didn\'t think so, I wouldn\'t have let this get off the ground, Yuma thought. *Homura‐nee‐chan too, despite her concerns. I\'m glad Songpa finally changed her mind, in a way.*

Yuma made a face, tapping her fingers against her arm. Mami couldn\'t help but be reminded of when she was younger.

*As long as there is adequate supervision and she doesn\'t try anything too stupid, the likeliest disaster is a demon outbreak. Even worst case, we\'ll only lose the lab. I know that sounds callous.*

*It does.*

*That\'s actually not the only reason I called you out here. I just received word: the Sato clan has voted to support RC7071. That gives us enough votes for passage, but just barely. Shizuki wants all hands on deck,* now.

Mami felt her heart skip a beat.

\"You can take my car,\" Yuma said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules Committee Act #7071---numbered from the beginning of the current charter---had been submitted to the Legal Subcommittee nearly a year ago, by Shizuki Tsubasa (SR, Mitakihara). Since then it had slowly wound its way through the various committees, alternating between languishing in near‐death for long periods and sparking furious debate.

Significant parts of the MSY\'s political elite felt that the Charter of was seriously flawed, but opinions were divided between the Reformists, who felt that the Charter was only in need of some moderate refurbishment, and the Expansionists, who viewed expanding the reach of the MSY as a moral obligation, and were willing to make considerable concessions to make it happen.

This question of \"Manifest Destiny\"---a term borrowed from American history, and one that Mami wished no one in their faction had ever been stupid enough to use---dominated the political debate of the day, coloring considerations about centralization, grief cube management, corporate operations, and many other mind‐numbingly difficult topics.

Importantly, the public side of this debate included another faction, the Japanists, who had driven so much of the nationalist 2059 Charter. They had been much larger then, and their votes had been needed for the Charter to pass at all.

But since then, Akemi Homura\'s warnings against their policies had proved almost prophetic, weakening their public support and convincing many elected officials to switch sides. At length, especially after the Triad incidents, the Japanists were effectively shut out of the governing coalition. Their greatest victory had set the course of their destruction, a fate hopefully not about to be repeated.

Either way, Mami was here. A primarily Expansionist version of RC had reached the floor, shepherded by Shizuki and Kuroi influence, including just enough Reformist planks to pass. As a member of the Leadership Committee, Mami was usually absent, her abstention on all votes a ritual formality. Except for times like this.

But as her and Homura\'s votes entered the tally, crossing the threshold needed to invoke Article VII and begin the referendum process, Mami felt no sense of relief or triumph, even as the Expansionist faction---and many Reformists---rose to their feet in applause.

Even as she gave her prepared speech, lauding all those they would save, all she could see was the work.

How many would she save? How many would she fail?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Japan, April 2068.* 

\"You want to step down from the Soul Guard?\" Akari asked.

\"I\'m thinking about it,\" Mami said. \"I\'ve brought it up with Akemi‐san and the Leadership Committee. With the new Charter, foreign relations is going to be a big deal. There\'s going to be a new Head of Recruitment and Diplomacy, and I think I\'d be suited. I used to do a lot of that kind of work.\"

Akari frowned, closing her eyes for a moment. She hadn\'t been sure what to expect, when Mami invited her over to her apartment. The obvious thoughts crossed her mind, of course, but so far, all they had done today was eat cake and watch a movie---\"Stars Crossed Over Venus\", a sappy sci‐fi romance.

Still, Akari always enjoyed Mami\'s plush furnishings and expensive holo‐theater setup. She had also gotten the chance to lean her head onto Mami\'s other ample assets, which she appreciated.

Akari lifted her head slightly, turning to catch a glimpse of Mami\'s expression.

\"That\'s not the only reason, is it?\" she said.

Mami sighed.

\"No, it\'s not. Managing the Soul Guard is taking a lot out of me. It\'s not the work. It\'s the... everything else. The case reports, the injuries. I\'d be happier not knowing about any of it.\"

Mami ran her hand through Akari\'s hair nervously.

\"It\'ll still be a lot of responsibility,\" Akari said. \"And it\'d mean dealing with outside magical girls. You saw in Korea how that can be.\"

Mami\'s hand froze. Akari reached up to gently place her own hand upon it.

\"I know,\" Mami said. \"I just have to hope it\'s different.\"

Akari let her hand fall back down, and Mami began running hers through Akari\'s hair again, as they were both quiet for a moment.

\"Also, if I don\'t take the position,\" Mami said, a small quirk now on her lips, \"Takara‐san will be the likely pick.\"

Akari cringed sympathetically.

She was tempted to let the conversation lapse there, as Mami clearly intended, but she knew the ultimate point had yet to be discussed. Mami would just keep worrying herself over it if Akari didn\'t act.

\"If you took this role, you\'d be away from Mitakihara more often, and for longer,\" Akari said.

Mami looked away, hiding a guilty face.

\"I would happily bring you with me, whenever you could take time off from the lab,\" Mami said.

Akari thought about it, casting her eyes at the ceiling, then back, toward Mami\'s face. There wasn\'t a good answer here, was there? Just like Akari, Mami couldn\'t abandon the work.

She ought to give *some* answer, though. Of the two of them, Akari had far more relationship experience---though that wasn\'t saying much. Akari was still astounded to know that, somehow, she was Mami\'s first girlfriend. If they broke up, who knew how long it would be until Mami opened her heart again?

\"We\'re both adults,\" Akari said. \"More than that, honestly. We can make this work long‐distance if we have to. And if we can\'t, I promise I\'ll tell you *before* our relationship is damaged.\"

Mami was silent for a few seconds, before turning her eyes back towards Akari.

*Thank you,* she thought, with warmth.

Akari smiled back.

\"We have all the time in the world to figure things out, after all.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mami took the job shortly after.

With the new Charter came new changes in policy towards external magical girl groups. The initial expansion of the MSY across Japan had been fairly ad hoc, until the Charter of 2059 had made MSY membership mandatory for all magical girls within the MSY\'s claim of Japanese jurisdiction, and all but forbidden outside it. Expansion of the MSY beyond Japan would necessarily require a third model.

First, external magical girl groups---a solo magical girl counted as her own group---could now apply for \"associate\" status, which granted access to trade, training, aid, and travel privileges. This was similar to existing foreign arrangements---in China, South Korea, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and the western seaboard of the Americas, which would be grandfathered in---but much more standardized. The only costs were adherence to certain basic rules meant to maintain peace, and the granting of reciprocal rights to the MSY\'s membership.

This was a deliberately appealing deal, meant to rope in as many magical girls and as much territory as possible, so that the MSY\'s cultural influence could more easily spread throughout the fragmented magical girl world.

Second, \"associate\" groups could apply for full MSY membership. Officially, to placate the Reformists and Japanists, the process was modeled on the European Union\'s, and required candidates to meet several substantial requirements: establishing a record of neighborly behavior, undergoing a trial period in the MSY\'s grief cube sharing system, and facing a \"values‐compatibility\" assessment, among other obstacles.

Unofficially, there were waivers and shortcuts for most everything, and the order of the day was getting anyone and everyone to apply as soon as practicable, or even to apply for them. For particularly inconvenient groups---say, those that had longstanding blood feuds with their neighbors---the MSY would sponsor a formal mediation process, sometimes outright paying settlements itself in the name of encouraging peace and progress.

It was Mami\'s job to handle all of that, conducting diplomacy, lubricating the MSY bureaucracy, and generally making things happen, by hook or by crook. She put together a new set of specialists underneath her to help, some from her Soul Guard days, especially those conducting dangerous in‐person mediation. Mami had confided mixed feelings to Akari about that---in‐person negotiations were a favorite assignment of hers, and she longed to resume them personally, even after the disaster that had led to at Songpa.

Meanwhile, their relationship progressed, in an almost banal fashion. When Mami was in Mitakihara, they went on dates, they cooked meals together, they helped each other train magic, and just had fun. When Mami was away, and Akari couldn\'t join her, they regularly talked online, late into sleepless nights: about magic, the Law of Cycles, the soul, grief, and other mysteries when Akari was worked up, about politics, ethics, the future, or the past when Mami was.

Akari finally moved into Mami\'s apartment, too. Kyubey, for once, commented that the action was logical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Japan, December 2068.* 

In the year since she had started at the \"lab\", Akari had hired two junior magical girls as helpers, as well as pair of TNC technicians who stayed strictly outside the main lab space. They brainstormed, they poked grief cubes, they ate drone‐delivered takeout in Akari\'s office.

According to the classified records Yuma had given her, the edges of the corruption--grief‐cube--soul‐gem system were more malleable than commonly presumed. Grief cubes could be forced to take on more capacity, corruption could take all kinds of unusual forms, and, perhaps most worryingly, there were hints that soul gems were not truly immalleable constructs. The only rule consistently followed was that using magic led to corruption somewhere.

With this information---the research notes of a half‐dozen authors that Akari suspected were mostly not MSY---she had identified two initial promising directions, and a third she didn\'t feel safe taking on. After some negotiation, she had agreed to let a different researcher---one Tamaki Mai---take on the study of non‐grief cube corruption.

She would take on the energy gap question---the question triple‐underlined in one of the notes. The question was fundamental: there seemed to be no consistent mapping whatsoever between the amount of corruption generated and the amount of energy generated in the real world. Different magical girls generated energy levels spanning numerous orders of magnitude, and some magical girls---famously, Akemi Homura---could even amplify the efforts of others.

\"It doesn\'t make a whole lot of sense,\" one of her researchers said, projecting the latest set of numbers onto the screen in her room. "It\'s like there just isn\'t a limit.\"

That was Etsuko Hina, one of her researchers. She had come up with a scheme to probe the magic‐energy connection---find someone with a wish‐granted power, then contrive a scenario so that using the power would perform a variable amount of work. The hypothesis had been that the task would get progressively more difficult for the magical girl as the energy requirement increased.

Instead, the energy requirement seemed not to matter at all. The girl would simply generate more and more energy without changing the amount of magic used---until, at some unclear point, their experimental apparatus would simply stop working. *How* it stopped working varied, but at some point the magic would simply bypass whatever trick they were using and achieve its effect directly. Or snap the carbon rope they were using.

\"Maybe there *isn\'t* a limit,\" Togame Nao, her other researcher, said. \"The Incubators always say that they\'re using us for power, to save the universe. Maybe there\'s just *a lot* of power.\"

\"I\'ll try to remember that the next time I\'m getting overpowered in a demon fight,\" Hina said, sarcastically. \"Really, though, you\'d think that\'d be more obvious.\"

\"Maybe not,\" Akari said. \"What historical records we have imply that we\'ve been getting stronger and faster over time, and there have been a few records of mages achieving tremendous, impossible feats.\"

\"After which they immediately died from power drain,\" Nao pointed out.

\"Yes, but still.\"

The discussion only meandered in circles after that, and they headed home shortly after.

It would have been easy for Akari to simply step into a cab and leave, but as she stepped outside, she felt too restless to just go home.

That was how it always was, she thought. She was never happy just staying in a box, plugging away at her own little problems. Not while there were other things going on, just outside.

She took a breath, breathing in the moist, chill air of the evening, and looked around her. Why not take a walk? That would help her gain perspective.

She turned down the street, taking a moment to wave vaguely at the night guard, who peered curiously at her over the crumbling roof.

So she turned down the street, stepping gingerly over shattered and crumbling pavement, the weeds and ornamental plants so overgrown that they could barely be distinguished. Shadows lay deep between the buildings, and what streetlamps were intact had long since been cut off from the power grid.

This was hardly the neighborhood for wandering, least of all for an apparent young woman. It took only a short while for her to get lost entirely.

But someone like her could take care of herself.

The moon shone down upon Akari as she turned a corner, drawing her eye. With her inhuman eyes, she saws its splendor, and the way it reflected against the buildings, facades of ash that covered spindles of charred coal. It was easy to imagine the way they must have once been, full of narrow ambition and heavy industry. So, too, it was easy to imagine how the road weaved forward, as she knew it must, towards decrepit public housing, neighborhoods where the poor and aging of Mitakihara languished indefinitely.

The MSY wasn\'t powerful enough to save the world. It couldn\'t even save its own city. Against decay like this, what power they had seemed painfully hollow. If only they could just unlock more---

It would take a miracle to save this world.

Akari sighed and shook the thoughts from her head, then turned back. She needed to get back to work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Japan, June 2069.* 

\"I bet Mami‐san would be *really* good at it,\" Kyouko said.

Mami\'s ears perked up at the mention of her name. She had tuned out of the conversation, preferring to listen in to Homura\'s side of the table, where Yuma and Homura were debating the relative merits of sous vide cooking.

\"Good at what?\" she asked, catching Kyouko\'s eye.

\"Telepathy. *Mind*‐reading,\" Kyouko said, lilting the second word as she pointed her chopsticks at Mami. \"We were talking about how useful it\'d be for your work.\"

Kyouko turned to talk enthusiastically at Akari, waving the chopsticks in the air.

\"Hey, hey, did you know? Mami is one of the MSY\'s *biggest* experts in new power development, if you\'re going outside of what\'s natural for you.\"

\"Yeah, I do know,\" Akari said, looking a bit subdued by the company. "She\'s, uh, told me.\"

\"Bragged, you mean,\" Kyouko said. \"Anyway, I dated a mind‐reader once. It was crazy useful, for all kinds of things.\"

Mami smiled slightly in polite acknowledgment.

\"Well, it might be, but you know I\'ve always found it a bit intrusive,\" she said. \"So I don\'t want to go that way.\"

\"But, I mean, is that a good enough reason?\" Akari asked. \"The MSY is one of the biggest organizations for good in the world. I\'ve listened to your stories about all the problems you\'re facing. Would it really hurt that much? Learning some telepathy skills just isn\'t all that big a deal.\"

Mami blinked at her, wondering how exactly she could respond politely.

\"We\'ve tried telling her that before,\" Homura said, daintily slicing at a piece of ribeye. \"She insists it\'s unnecessary.\"

\"Not everyone is like you two,\" Kyouko said, rolling her eyes. \"It\'s normal for some people to have scruples.\"

\"Let\'s not do this right now,\" Mami said, raising her hands. \"Let\'s just eat.\"

The conversation shifted elsewhere, but the topic stayed in her mind. Akari seemed a bit off the rest of the dinner, as if something was bothering her.

So Mami asked about it when the time came, later that night, after Kyouko and the others had found their excuses to depart her apartment.

\"It\'s not that big a deal because telepathy isn\'t just breaking into people\'s heads without their permission,\" Akari said, shaking her head. \"That\'s exactly the kind of perception the Telepaths\' Guild tries to fight against. It can do all kinds of other things, like foster empathy, help mages work together, improve mood and morale. Help with relationships.\"

Akari\'s eyes glanced past her as she said the last line.

\"It\'s sort of narrow‐minded to think of it as just some kind of insidious thing,\" Akari said.

Mami looked down at the other girl, who was seated on their couch, trying to read her expression.

\"I...\" she began, before pressing a hand to her face.

\"I knew that. But honestly, that other stuff has never seemed that important to me. The divisions I\'ve run have worked fine without any of that, so...\"

She furrowed her brow. She knew there were others who were much closer to their lieutenants, but she just didn\'t run things like that. But with Akari, well, she was the best thing that had ever happened to her, and that, at least, gave her new incentives.

\"Is this important to you?\" she asked. \"That I maybe learn a little telepathy?\"

\"It is,\" Akari said, shrugging. \"But you know, I didn\'t want to ask just because of that. I\'ve dated non‐telepaths. But it makes things a lot easier.\"

Mami stood still for a few seconds, tapping her foot on the floor.

\"I\'ll think about it,\" she said. \"Not for work, or espionage, but for us. Just... let me think about it.\"

Akari nodded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Japan, February 2070.* 

The charter rewrite had turned the foreign situation into a chaotic mess.

Mami had expected that, of course. They *all* had. There was just no way anything so fraught with power and wealth and raw human emotion could become anything else.

Yet somehow, even though she quite literally signed on for the role, she found herself unprepared.

In just over two years, the official membership rolls of the MSY had more than doubled.

It had been a very good idea, in retrospect, to concede such a large degree of local autonomy for new territory in the 2067 Charter. The MSY\'s bureaucracy could barely keep up as it was.

Prospects varied, of course. The situation in China had actually improved*, since full representation and a formal system of delegated local rule was leagues better than the previous mishmash of indirect representation and overlapping jurisdictions. In the Americas, by contrast, frustrations were mounting over a heavy application backlog, amidst disputes over local politics, free trade zones, and petty tyrants. Southeast Asia had bright spots, like Vietnam, but overall the region was tense---too many attacks on girls who joined the MSY, too often repaid in blood. It was enough that Mami had asked to stop receiving detailed combat reports.

The problem she had to confront today was Korea. Well, not just the Korea she had expected, but also *North* Korea.

The world\'s longest humanitarian crisis, the open sore on the face of Asia, North Korea\'s horrendous politics had carried over into the magical girl realm. Over a century ago, true believers had fought a simmering war across the demilitarized zone long after most of the mundane fighting had stopped, and the scars of that conflict remained, even as North Korean refugees began to trickle south. Some were welcomed, others tolerated, and still others forced back, or worse. Raids became common in both directions---south for supplies and food, north for bountiful grief cubes. Bodies piled up.

A ceasefire eventually took hold, brokered by the Incubators, but the gaping cut of the DMZ and CCZ ran across the magical world too, dividing the two Koreas territorially, culturally, and institutionally, with repercussions extending throughout and beyond Seoul. Only the trade economy was different: the border was porous, and the locals had grown dependent on the flow of grief cubes south, in exchange for material goods headed north.

And that\'s what the MSY had stepped into. The teams that joined couldn\'t simply maintain the old patterns, not with the MSY flooding the markets with both grief cubes and material resources. This was fine for the residents of Seoul, but decidedly *not* for those further north, from either side of the border. They had grown dependent on arbitraging their way to a living in an otherwise precarious environment, managing the bilateral trade.

The MSY had predicted *some* degree of economic recoil. That, at least, was foreshadowed by their pre‐charter revision experiences, particularly in China. But they hadn\'t realized how essential the cross‐DMZ trade was, both economically and for the local identity. In a strange way the border girls were kindred spirits, closer to each other than any outsiders, despite the lingering hostility.

Now the entire region around the DMZ was in a state of inflammation, filled with a searing anger against the invaders who had come to destroy their way of life. Joining the MSY was out of the question. Those from just south of the DMZ filed formal protests and complained bitterly to the teams in Seoul. They harassed MSY operations and demanded compensation, with hints about escalation.

Mami had little intelligence about those from North Korea, but what little she knew suggested they were well past merely *threatening escalation.

\"How the hell did I let this become such a mess?\" Mami groaned, placing her forehead onto the table. \"This *should* be solvable, but it all just gets so complex. Just pay them off, the Rules Committee says, but then everyone gets jealous of each other and the committees start asking why you\'re spending so much money.\"

She wasn\'t exactly being coherent, she knew, but she hoped her tone was sarcastic enough.

\"One should never be surprised,\" Homura said, in a passive voice. "When has helping anyone ever generated anything but annoying complications? But we\'ll get through it.\"

Mami didn\'t look up. She never said so, but she hated how insufferable Homura could be at times like this, smug like she had seen everything before. So what if she had overlooked one rural area? The MSY was expanding simultaneously on four separate continents!

\"Anyway, the situation might be bad, but it\'s not really a threat to our overall position,\" Homura said. \"The locals in Seoul see the benefits of working with us, and our enhanced procedures. The natural solution for the traders in the north is to work with us too. Assistance needs to be tied to cooperation. That\'s how incentives work.\"

This time Mami did look up, glaring Homura in the eye.

\"You\'re saying we shouldn\'t help them so they\'ll be forced to join us,\" she said. \"Even though we\'re the ones who upended their way of life.\"

\"A favorable trade environment is not an inviolable right,\" Homura said. \"Nor is subsidizing one a wise strategy.\"

Mami narrowed her eyes. This wasn\'t the first time she\'d heard logic like that. It wasn\'t that it was *wrong*, exactly.

\"Being selfish isn\'t why I\'m here, Akemi‐san,\" she said.

\"I\'m not being selfish either,\" Homura said. \"Getting these girls into the MSY will make them far wealthier than the border trade ever could, and triple their life expectancy besides.\"

They stared at each other for a long moment, anger against ice, until it was Homura who relented, turning her head away.

\"You\'re right that it is cold logic,\" she said. \"But we can\'t really do better. Not if we want to change things. I wish the world were different, but you don\'t get perfect solutions. Not without, well, a wish. I never really mastered the art of that.\"

Homura leaned back in her chair, gaining a wistful look Mami was familiar with.

Mami chose not to interrupt, glancing awkwardly around Homura\'s office. There wasn\'t much to see: the basic high‐end corporate furniture, a window out onto the city, the faint whiff of magic. The only dose of sentimentality was a framed portrait of an October Three party---not that anyone outside the Mitakihara Four could identify it as such.

It was only natural that Homura keep her eccentricity contained within her home apartment, she supposed.

\"It\'s all academic anyway,\" Homura said finally, leaning back forward. \"We both agree it may not be a great idea, and it would be a hard sell anyway. What *are* you going to tell the Rules Committee?\"

Mami straightened out in her chair, finding to her surprise that her mood had improved.

\"The truth,\" she said. \"South Korea is too sensitive to safely play games with, not when everyone still remembers Songpa.\"

\"They do,\" Homura said. \"It really hurts us that we can\'t really know what\'s going in North Korea. If we did, we might be able to ease tensions, make this less sensitive politically.\"

\"There\'s always diplomacy,\" Mami said. \"If we even knew who to talk to.\"

\"Of course,\" Homura said, folding her hands. \"I didn\'t mean to imply otherwise.\"

Mami\'s contacts signaled her for her next meeting---more precisely, she had been muting the notification for the past fifteen minutes. It was really time she got going.

Plus, she conceded to herself, she really didn\'t want to have any more of that conversation. Yuma had been pushing for a while for some kind of foreign information service, a Soul Guard agency tasked with gathering data and contacts outside their borders, occasionally taking action as necessary.

That was how Yuma would describe it, at least.

It was an intelligence agency, of course, or so close to one the distinction didn\'t matter, and the committees were divided on the subject. Once they started going down that road, who knew where they would end up? Would they start manufacturing \"incidents\"?

It was tempting to think that because it was *us*, it wouldn\'t get out of control, but that seemed like a dangerous assumption to make. Kyouko and several of the others agreed.

The MSY could take a bit of uncertainty, for now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Japan, March 2070.* 

The two years since their relationship started had passed surprisingly slowly---in a good way. Years were supposed to blur together at their age, and yet it felt as if they had known each other for far longer than they had, made more memories than the days would normally allow.

That wasn\'t to say life was perfect---Mami was away on diplomatic missions all too often, working and worrying far more than was healthy, while Akari and her team struggled to make headway against her chosen research topic, the energy gap.

But these were trifling concerns in the grand scheme of things. So why was some part of Akari still unsatisfied, some nagging teenage version of her asking, day after day, if she was really fulfilling her wish?

As much as she hated to admit it, part of the problem was probably just comparing herself to Mami. Internal statistical estimates suggested that Mami\'s Recruiting and Diplomacy work had saved over two hundred magical girl lives in the last year alone, not to mention the massive quality‐of‐life improvements for thousands more, *and* their families. Meanwhile, Akari had achieved only a failed series of experiments.

*You\'re being too hard on yourself, Akari,* Mami thought, entering the room with two cups of freshly‐brewed tea. *Sorry for the aphorism, but it needs to be said. Again.*

Mami sat down on the couch next to her, wrapping an arm around her.

*Akemi‐san is still impressed you convinced Kyubey to let you experiment with extracting energy directly from soul gems,* Mami continued, using her most persuasive smile. *She mentioned it again the other day.*

*Probably because he knew it was a dead end, as long as the gem is intact,* Akari grumbled, leaning into Mami\'s embrace. *And besides, you helped me do that.*

*It was worth learning,* Mami thought. *You know what Chitose‐san always says about failed experiments. And there\'s no shame in making use of the resources available to you---even if someone might think an adorable young kouhai was taking advantage of her lonely old senpai.*

Akari turned to face Mami, who returned a completely innocent look.

\"I\'m nearly fifty,\" Akari said.

\"Oh, so now you admit it,\" Mami said, tilting her head.

Akari shook her head, laughing softly. Somehow, teasing each other about their ages never grew old.

She sat up, and took a sip of the tea Mami had brought out. There was no sense in letting Mami\'s expert work go cold.

They enjoyed their tea together for a while, but Akari couldn\'t fully shake her earlier thoughts from her head. Mami was older, yes, but by the time she was thirty, she had founded the MSY, achieving more good than Akari possibly ever could.

She knew Mami could read those thoughts, too. Kyouko had been right, the woman really was a natural telepath.

Perhaps that was why Mami was suddenly so silent, looking thoughtfully at her tea. Or was something else at play?

\"I\'m thinking about restarting in‐person negotiations in Korea,\" Mami said suddenly. \"Those were productive, the last time I did them, and the moment may be ripe.\"

Akari thought she understood, even without a mind‐read.

\"Mami,\" she began.

*You know you don\'t need to stay, just for me,* would have been the rest of the sentence, but Mami didn\'t let her finish.

\"I want you to go with me,\" Mami interrupted. \"I know how you feel, and maybe you\'ll find something satisfying working with me. You could let your assistants manage the lab while you manage my security. And there are some Korean experts that might be worth talking to, as part of our new partnership agreements. It would be partially a sabbatical.\"

Akari took a small breath. Mami had clearly put some thought into this.

\"I know you wouldn\'t want to put your career on hold,\" Mami said. "But the research hasn\'t been moving fast, right? Maybe you just need a break, some time to get a new perspective. When\'s the last time you had a vacation?\"

*More than two years ago,* Akari thought automatically, but bit her lip. What a thing for Mami to say, since the woman herself never took vacations either.

\"I know we haven\'t gotten to spend as much time together as we\'d like,\" Mami said, putting her hand on Akari\'s. \"If we aren\'t going to take vacations, we can at least do this together. What do you say?\"

Akari looked down. What was there to say? She could ask for time to think about it, but it was obviously a good idea, mutually beneficial. It felt like the only possible reason to say no, in the end, would be pure stubbornness.

It also felt a little like she had just been completely outmaneuvered in a diplomatic negotiation.

*Sorry,* Mami thought, suddenly about as sheepish as Akari ever saw her. It\'s just, I...*

Akari could feel what she meant. Mami had been worrying about the malaise Akari was falling into again, had come up with this idea, and had gotten really excited by the prospect of going back to in‐person negotiations with Akari at her side. Overeager, perhaps.

Not to mention, there was always that worry in the back of Mami\'s mind, that Akari might tire not just of her job, but of their relationship too. This plan promised to beat back both threats at once.

The latter worry was unfounded, as always, Akari thought with special emphasis. Loving Mami was a lot easier and much more rewarding than Akari\'s endless struggle against her wish.

*Alright,* Akari thought, a smile on her lips. *Let\'s try it. Those poor Koreans won\'t know what hit them.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An audio montage introduces the stream, highlighting the sounds and drama of major world events, as far back as the 2020s.

\"This is In the Light, your weekly news podcast about happenings out there in surface world, and its impact on those us living down here.\"

\"Hi everyone. I\'m your host, Togame Miwako. This week... well, it\'s been a big week, hasn\'t it? And not in a good way. As easy as it is to forget about the wider world, events of this magnitude affect us all, especially if things go sideways.\"

\"Here to talk us through all this is a special guest, Dr. Akino Toki, specialist on East Asian relations, who also happens to be my good friend. How are you, Dr. Akino?\"

\"I\'m glad to be here, Togame‐san. These are dark times, with relations between North and South Korea the worst they\'ve been in decades. That\'s not an accident, of course. The Incubators made sure all evidence in the Songpa Incident would point to the north.\"

\"Why do you think things were done like that, Dr. Akino?\"

\"Please, you don\'t have to call me that. But, no one really knows. What happened in Songpa was beyond our ability to hide, so the decision was made to ask the Incubators for assistance. It was they who chose to pin it on North Korea, claiming that a fabricated terrorist group would be too implausible for such an apparently sophisticated attack. The logic was that the mundane authorities would eventually blame North Korea anyway, so why prompt an unnecessarily long and thorough investigation that could drag in MSY affiliates?\"

\"We all know the Incubators can\'t be relied upon to tell the whole truth. Was that their entire reason, Akino‐san?\"

\"As far as I know, yes.\"

There is a moment of silence.

\"Of course, things have not been quite so clean. Pariahs or not, even North Korea couldn\'t launch a terrorist attack in Seoul without some kind of repercussions. For a while, the dance of sanctions and aid reductions and vehement denials by North Korea seemed to follow the historical pattern, with long‐time Korea watchers predicting an eventual show of conciliation by the north, leading to a cooling of tensions. This time, however, none of that has happened.\"

\"To those of you listening, if you haven\'t already, I encourage you to pause and take a look on mundane news sources to catch up on the latest escalations. North Korea has begun raiding local shipping, as 'compensation for illegal and unjust sanctions\', and has also managed to hack and steal a number of automated fishing vessels.

The US Seventh Fleet is deploying a carrier to the Sea of Japan in response, and just today, South Korean Ambassador Chung Ki‐nam has presented a case for further sanctions to the Tri‐Pacific Council.\"

\"As you\'ve said, though, Akino‐san, we\'ve been in these kinds of situations before, haven\'t we? There\'s over a century of diplomatic precedent to work with. This can\'t really be worse than when they first started testing real ICBMs---I was alive for that, you know.\"

\"This time could be different, Togame‐san. North Korea is not in a normal state.

The current ruler of North Korea is the aging Park Sung‐won, who seized control of the country in a coup nearly twenty years ago. Some sources claim he\'s on the verge of death, and while we haven\'t been able to substantiate that, he hasn\'t been seen in public in over a year.

It is important to remember that though North Korea has a reputation as an ironclad dictatorship, Park has never enjoyed the kind of absolute control his predecessors did. From what we can tell, he is reliant on the support of a number of key military officials, who have divided the country between them. If he is truly dying, it isn\'t clear what would happen or who would be his successor.

In that context, an international crisis is tremendously destabilizing. Mundane experts have long speculated that the attack in Seoul was part of some kind of domestic power play, and might not have had the approval of the entire North Korean state. While the North Koreans themselves may or may not know better, internal factions may have decided that the truth of the matter is irrelevant if they can successfully pin the blame on their opponents.\"

If Park dies, it\'d be a good play---so good, everyone might try it. In the worst case, we may even see a civil war.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *South Korea, April 2070.* 

*I\'m sorry to interrupt, Mami, you\'ll want to see this.*

Mami smiled at the others in the room, politely turning her head to indicate that she was receiving a message. She could have kept it hidden, of course, but it was the little things that helped build trust. In this case, she was in a key meeting with representatives from Paju‐si, a city between Seoul and the DMZ, and she needed it to go well.

Then she frowned, listening to what Akari had to say. She glanced over at the two representatives, who looked back at her with curious looks. As was customary, communication was telepathic, which helped avoid language snafus.

*We might as well all see this, then,* Mami thought.

*Pardon the interruption,* she thought. *There\'s been an incident.*

She slid open a panel on the side of the table and tapped in a few quick keystrokes. The screen at the end of the table snapped to life, shimmering briefly as its holographic features spun online.

\"This is the scene in Seogang‐dong today,\" a female announcer said, as a drone camera panned over a pair of toppled residential towers, one of which had landed directly onto a major freeway. Cars, smoke, and helicopters circled the area.

It took Mami only a moment to place the location. Seogang‐dong was central Seoul.

\"Witnesses say that there was a rumble, followed by a collapse of structures in the area. It does not appear to be a conventional explosion.\"

The screen shifted, switching to long‐range surveillance footage of a freeway crossing, with on‐ramps, residential towers, and a bridge in the background. A glaring green glow enveloped the screen, followed by an ominous rumbling. As the glare faded, there was just enough time to see a huge circular chunk missing from one of the freeways and the adjacent towers, as if someone had come through with a giant laser.

The video started over, and now it zoomed into part of the detonation, a large square region focusing on the edge of a pair of skyscrapers, gathered from a composite of civilian footage. The same green flash appeared, plumes of dust, concrete, and glass manifesting out of the buildings, before the blast wave swept through the frame, blowing furniture, glass, and *people* out into the air, including a few objects mosaic‐censored by the news agency. The tops of the buildings themselves began to topple.

Then dust overwhelmed the scene.

*That\'s no ordinary explosive,* Akari thought, having stepped into the doorway while the newscast was playing. *This isn\'t MSY territory, so it took us a while to get news, but every magical girl within four kilometers felt it. They\'re still trying to get the status of the team in Seogang‐dong.*

\"This is obviously a great tragedy, and we have no idea about the casualties, which authorities fear number into the thousands,\" the announcer said. \"But after the Songpa Incident, the immediate question---\"

\"I want you to know, this had nothing to do with us,\" one of the two Paju‐si representatives said, placing her hand on the table and switching to accented, spoken Japanese. She was obviously shaken. \"We came here to negotiate. There\'s no way we would try something like this.\"

*I wouldn\'t rush to judgment like that,* Mami thought. *You would hardly be the prime suspects anyway.*

*Though we can\'t rule them out just because they claim innocence,* Mami thought, at Akari. *Hard to think they\'re lying, though. They don\'t feel like it at all.*

*Agreed,* Akari thought.

Mami had to resist the urge to try to read their minds. It would have been a major breach of trust and her own beliefs. More practically, she wasn\'t sure she was good enough to avoid being caught.

She *did* glean a bit of surface emotions, superficially traceable. They seemed as distraught as one might expect.

*My apologies,* she thought, standing and bowing to the Paju‐si representatives. *I must request we postpone our meeting, given current events. If you can stay in the city a bit longer, my associates will set up a new one. Of course, your lodging costs will be covered.*

*Of course we\'ll stay,* one of the representatives thought. *I think the terms of our discussion might be about to change anyway.*

Hiding a grimace, Mami turned to leave the room, Akari in tow.

\"We have to get over there,\" Mami said, stating the obvious. \"Offer whatever teams we have for forensics. I\'m sure the locals will want to know just as badly as we do.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Negotiating with the local magical girls wasn\'t quite as straightforward as Mami predicted. The situation was as chaotic as one might expect, with many of the locals opting to hunker down, and some of those who remained in no mood to allow outsiders in what was now a demon‐filled hunting zone.

What sealed it in the end was the reappearance of part of the original Seogang‐dong team---to be precise, *one member* of the team, who had been dug unconscious out of the ruins by a mundane rescue team. Waking up with what would have been crippling injuries to a mundane human, she had slipped away from the medical staff and taken herself straight to one of the local councils, screaming with accusations against another of the local teams, one she claimed had always been at their throats.

They denied being involved, of course, but no one could really prove anything either way.

And so, after precious hours had been wasted, the council had finally called the MSY, who might have the expertise to untangle things.

A skilled soul mage was a useful thing to have in an investigative team, too, and so Akari found herself stepping out of a Special Task Force vehicle into the disaster zone.

In that moment she found herself regretting either her arrival, or her magical girl status. The air that slammed into her carried with it the scent of fire and destruction---something any human could smell---but also more exotic odorants. The smell of dead or burning flesh. Of fear and despair.

The visuals had not prepared her.

She gathered herself with an effort, following the map that laid itself out on her contacts, and the guidance of their National Intelligence Service contact. Their uniforms protected them from the inquiries of other officers on‐site, though they got plenty of curious looks.

Without any buildings or trees to screen them, they were exposed to the elements, the sun bearing down upon them, some of it gleaming off of pieces of glass buried in the rubble. Only part of the debris had been cleared, and their path took them near sharp exposed steel and uncomfortably unstable ridges of concrete.

\"The explosive charge used, if it even was one, was highly unusual,\" the NIS officer said. \"Preliminary modeling by specialized EERs suggests that the energy waveform was highly directed, almost linear. Not like a standard explosion. But it is a mystery how it could travel a short distance and abruptly terminate.\"

He held up a presentation device, above which hovered an animation of the event. It held itself impressively still even as they walked.

\"Needless to say, our analysts are completely stumped. It\'s not clear if there\'s *anyone* capable of this, much less who it would be. Or why they would choose something like this rather than a simple bomb.\"

He put the device away.

\"However, the decision has already been made to classify these kinds of details, to prevent potential panic or further instability. However, this puts us in an awful position. Without a culprit to blame, the public will go wild, and who can blame them? The pressure is on to blame someone*.\"

He looked at Mami meaningfully. She sighed.

\"No, we don\'t have a good candidate yet. We don\'t want to do North Korea again, but what other options are there? And if we blame nobody, that just means we let someone else choose for us.\"

\"Right, well, I hope your investigation here gives you some better ideas,\" the officer said.

He stopped, peering into his contacts; the ground had been clear for a while now.

\"We\'re here,\" he said. \"This is ground zero, according to our models. Not where you\'d expect it, based on where the casualties are, but it matches the camera footage too. The device could have also been above us, near the highway. Assuming it was a device.\"

He paused, giving Mami a look.

\"Thanks for the help,\" Mami said. \"We\'ll be alright from here.\"

He nodded, then took out a cigarette and lighter, stepping away from them. He looked pointedly off into the distance, ignoring activity that was no longer his business.

Mami and Akari took the cue, leaving him behind.

Much of the MSY team was already here, blending in with some of the other investigators processing the site. Here, at ground zero, there was no one left to rescue, so they could at least operate freely. As Mami watched, one of the girls guided a familiar disguised as a small drone to look for magic traces, while another conducted a scrying ritual behind a metal privacy screen, something that involved three glass bowls of water, a soul gem, and a large mirror.

The wind picked up clouds of dust, driving a barrage of particles into their faces, reminding them to stop standing around.

\"Any progress?\" Mami asked, stepping up to the privacy screen.

\"Some,\" forensic investigator Inoue Yoko, Clairvoyant, said, without looking up. \"This was a high‐impact event, so I was able to get a really good read, but all I\'ve managed to do is confirm that the source arrived in an autocar, as was already expected. No occupants, but there was a backpack in the trunk, and the car was driving south. Unfortunately, the trail drops off rapidly moving backwards from there. We\'ve requested a warrant for the car\'s logs. I was just about to try to get up into the air and see if I could get a better read.\"

\"That tells us at least that this wasn\'t simply a girl detonating her soul gem in a suicide bombing,\" Mami said. \"It\'s worthwhile progress, especially if the logs have something.\"

\"It\'s only some progress, and we probably need to move fast,\" Yoko said, shaking her head. \"It doesn\'t tell us who did this or why. But that\'s not everything the team has found. You should go talk to Ruiko over there, she found a couple of fragments of magical residue that might tell you something.\"

*I meant it when I said it was progress,* Mami thought to Akari, as they walked away. *It might not be everything, but it might be enough information to rule out any of the local teams. I hate to sound like all I care about is the politics, but there are very few magical girls capable of building a free‐standing, high‐energy magical construct. Probably fewer than ten on the whole Korean peninsula. Unfortunately, two live in Seoul.*

Ruiko saw them coming, and turned to show them what she had found, a few scraps of something charred beyond recognition that she had gathered in a plastic bag. Akari could tell their value instantly, though.

She took the plastic bag, holding it up to her own soul gem for a closer look, closing her eyes. It whispered to her, a simmering brew of magical scents. Two flavors were predominant---the all‐too‐familiar taste of corruption, a malaise that seeped into one\'s soul just feeling it, and the flavor of someone\'s magic, someone she didn\'t know.

There was something else, though, the faint whiff of *another* mage\'s magic. Two magical girls? And something about the whole arrangement struck her as somehow familiar---

She opened her eyes slowly, feeling a chill in her heart. She looked around.

\"What is it?\" Ruiko asked, seeing the look on her face.

\"Do you have a microscope? Or something similar?\" Akari asked.

Ruiko knelt, reaching into her bag for a field microscope, which Akari placed on a small piece of flat rubble.

Looking into it, she found what she didn\'t want to see.

Tiny flecks of something glassy embedded in a charred matrix, pulsing in her eyes with residual magic---no, residual *soul*. The mix of corruption she had been feeling resembled her own experiments with darkened soul gems, conducted on volunteers.

Another few hours, and the evidence would have been gone, she thought. There was only one likely candidate for the glassy substance.

\"This is a shattered soul gem,\" she said, preferring not to look up from the scope. \"There\'s also residual soul magic, from another magical girl. Given that we know there probably wasn\'t an embodied magical girl in the car, this suggests it was some kind of forced procedure, with the soul gem likely serving as the bomb\'s power source.\"

Ruiko started to say something, face shocked, but coughed on something instead.

*I would have thought forcing a soul gem detonation on someone else was impossible,* Akari added, only to Mami. *Like how powers can\'t be taken without true consent. Perhaps this wasn\'t a soul gem detonation, but rather a bomb which stole the energy from the victim\'s soul gem, somehow.*

The silence was long enough for Akari to look up, and see a pained emotion contort itself through Mami\'s face.

She felt terrible for not noticing earlier, but she couldn\'t just mind‐read Mami with other magical girls around---their relationship wasn\'t public.

\"Is it enough for you to recognize who did it?\" Mami asked, finally, voice strained.

\"If I met them,\" Akari said, quietly, handing scope back to Ruiko. \"I haven\'t met all the magical girls of Seoul. Now might be a good time to.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was none of them, of course.

In a way, that was a relief. Akari had no interest in starting an internecine conflict within Seoul, nor did she want to meet the kind of person who could come up with the notion of a soul gem‐based terrorist attack.

But it was no relief to the sole survivor of the Seogang‐dong team, who had clearly, desperately, wanted the culprit to be one of her established enemies. Akari had seen it before. It would make everything so easy; it would put revenge right in front of her.

And then Mami had gone and slipped the girl an MHD counseling invite. And a hint that, now that she no longer had a team, the MSY might have a place for her. Mami had made it sound so natural, when it could have easily been extremely crass.

It didn\'t lessen Akari\'s discomfort, though. It was not quite what she had expected, seeing Mami\'s work up close.

Akari looked up from the desk she had been sleeping on, unsure what had pulled her out of her lull. Something---

Oh. It was a familiar soul gem signal. One of her research assistants, buried among the noise of the many soul gems in D&E\'s Seoul HQ. She had been supposed to arrive soon. But that wasn\'t for a while, it was still---

*Nevermind,* she thought, checking her lens clock and rubbing her eyes. She had been out for way too long. Her earlier call with her parents had really drained her.

The Seogang‐dong bombing was still unsolved, and the perpetrator had mailed in a letter claiming responsibility, denouncing the MSY as colonialist oppressors, and claiming they had intended to target the MSY to force them to pull out. The traces of magic on the letter verified its authenticity, but gave no other identifying details. Probably as intended.

It was disturbing, that a second anti‐MSY soul mage had emerged in as many years. Akari supposed there were few other lone magical girls who could attack the MSY and hope to escape the consequences, using other mages as a shield more effectively than telepaths ever could.

Akari almost wondered if the MSY had gotten something wrong, in its reaction to Seoyun and Songpa. But given the circumstances, what else could they even have done? The MSY was more open and generous than ever, now, but sometimes that just wasn\'t enough.

She said hello to Hina as she got closer, opening the door for her assistant as she arrived, guiding a self‐propelled trolley of equipment into the makeshift lab space.

Akari had set up shop in Seoul with two objectives. Her first was to try and find the Seogang‐dong Bomber through their magical wares. The local Council was quietly purchasing magical items off the trade markets and passing them along, relying on Akari to scan them for a familiar magic signature. Magical devices changed many hands before arriving in Seoul, but if the goal was to find the culprit, \"follow the money\" was as serviceable a rule for the Soul Guard as it was for the mundane police, provided you remembered that grief cubes could be used as money.

But they had no luck. It didn\'t help that nearly all persons of interest flatly declined any form of telepathic screening or verification.

So while that part of the investigation continued, Akari was going to begin studying the concept and design of soul gem bombs. It was work that felt a tad odious, but she understood the criticality---perhaps she could figure out how to detect one from a great range, or how to train others to do the same. Maybe she could even craft a scanner.

Hina returned her greeting, then began unpacking onto the lab bench. She extracted a customized spectrometer, a containment device, robotic grief cube manipulators, and an entire assortment of enchanted hand tools, impossibly precise and capable of working on magical items without destroying their properties.

\"Mind sharing your thoughts on this new project?\" Hina asked when she was finished unpacking. \"I know it was a bit of a sensitive topic, but the idea of a bomb powered by an unwilling soul gem is... novel, if horrifying.\"

\"Right, I had some thoughts,\" Akari said, gesturing Hina to pull up a chair.

\"Magical or not, the idea behind every bomb is pretty much the same,\" Akari explained. \"Dump as much energy as you can, as fast as you can. That\'s true even if the mechanism of action is exotic. Here it was just a giant beam of energy, so the analogy works fine.\"

\"There\'s a lot of possibilities to work through,\" she continued. \"If you were capable of draining a soul gem all at once into a magical device, that would be good enough, but we know from our own experiments that it\'s very hard to drain energy quickly, and you\'d risk blowing the apparatus up before the reaction completed. A fizzle.\"

\"It *is* the simplest approach, though. Everything else I can think of involves storing the magic outside the gem, at least temporarily. If you could do that, you could even think about extending the process by providing grief cubes to refuel the gem, for as long as you could sustain it, using the gem as an intermediary for the grief cubes. You might even be able to spike the magic you drained with the corruption you generated from draining it. Plus, you\'ll be ending with a critical soul gem, and if you could siphon even just a little of the energy that vanishes when those are shattered or disappear...\"

\"That\'s diabolical,\" Hina said, with a morbidly impressed look. "Some kind of grief‐based yield enhancement would perhaps explain the enhanced demon spawns we saw in the area afterward. Maybe---?\"

\"Maybe, but let\'s not jump to conclusions,\" Akari said. \"That could easily just be all the suffering people. But it *would* correlate with the corruption I felt at the scene.\"

She leaned over, putting a hand to her forehead.

\"There\'s too many variables unaccounted for. We don\'t know what happens if you involve full grief cubes in something like this, and whether corruption can contribute to a reaction. We don\'t even really know for sure that a critical soul gem can\'t simply be triggered to detonate without the girl\'s consent. All we really have for that is a sort of educated hope, partially based on Mikuni Oriko\'s notes on power stealing. Those say that trying to forcibly seize a soul just leads to the Law of Cycles taking it away.\"

\"We have a lot of experiments to run,\" Hina said. \"But some of the things we\'d want to test... where would we ever get test subjects for something like that? We had a hard enough time recruiting near Mitakihara for light corruption studies. But here? And would we have to work with near‐critical soul gems? And explosive arrangements?\"

\"No, you\'re right,\" Akari said, raising her hand. \"It\'ll be dangerous work. We\'ll have to be very, very careful. And I honestly can\'t in good faith do anything but do soul gem testing on ourselves. I know; I know. But I\'ll do it if you or Nao‐chan are not comfortable with that.\"

Hina just stared blankly at Akari for a few seconds, before blinking once, twice.

\"Shit, alright,\" she said. \"If we have to. We\'ll have to come up with some new safety protocols. And run it by the ethics board.\"

\"I already started the process,\" Akari said.

She paused for a moment, hesitating.

\"What?\" Hina asked.

\"Nothing,\" Akari said. \"I just realized, I have to figure out how to tell Tomoe‐san.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Promise me you\'ll be careful, then.\"

Mami clutched at Akari\'s hands, causing her to look away.

\"Of course I\'ll be careful,\" she said. \"I know it\'s dangerous.\"

She took a slow breath.

\"But I\'m trained on this kind of thing. And Nao‐chan doubles as a safety technician. We\'ll be fine.\"

\"That\'s not the only thing I mean,\" Mami said, leaning forward. \"I don\'t just mean protocol. The kind of work you\'re planning here is... it carries the whiff of something we\'re not really meant to touch.\"

Akari stared at Mami for a moment. Mami sent a packet of feelings: worry and unease.

\"I know,\" Akari said. \"We thought about that. Everyone who has seen the plan has a bad feeling about it, but... you can\'t always trust instincts. Sometimes it\'s worth it anyway.\"

There were statistical analyses showing that the mood of older magical girls was significantly better than chance at predicting when things would go poorly, and ways to perform cost‐benefit analysis around that. It was a whole research topic.

Akari saw Mami make a thin‐lipped expression, and added:

\"Look, I know you\'re worried about my safety, but I need to do this. We both know this is important. We need to find the culprit, and prevent any further bombings.\"

Mami took a breath.

\"You have someone reviewing your experimental protocol? Doing spot checks? Let me volunteer. I\'m pretty old, so I should have better instincts than anyone. I can switch with anyone you have.\"

Akari bit back an immediate \"no\", realizing it was irrational. Mami was* good at performing instinct‐based gut checks.

\"I do already, and you have more important work, I\'m sure,\" Akari said.

\"Not more important than you,\" Mami said, straight‐faced.

There was brief telepathic exchange of feelings, and Akari felt herself blushing.

\"Listen,\" Mami said. \"It\'s about time I paid you back a little. I\'m the one dragging you into all this mess with me, with the bombs and all that. It\'s been nice, having someone there when everything seems to come crashing down. Those of us at the top, the older ones, everyone expects we\'ll be ready and steady, because we\'ve seen *so much*, and that\'s true. But the attrition gets to you, and the years just keep piling on, and---\"

She stopped, putting a hand to her forehead.

\"I got carried away a bit, but you know what I mean, I think. You keep saying, part of having a relationship is handling life\'s challenges together. If you\'re going to handle mine, I feel I should handle some of yours.\"

Akari wanted to argue, but she knew, could tell from the telepathic milieu, that she had already lost.

\"You shouldn\'t feel bad about dragging me into this,\" she said. "It\'s what I wanted, too, and now my research actually has a practical use. I\'m actually quite pleased by that, even if maybe I shouldn\'t be under the circumstances.\"

\"Well, I do hope you enjoy it,\" Mami said. \"Because I like having you here, and I would dread having to go back to working alone.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *South Korea, May 2070.* 

It took a moment for the secure room equipment to spin up, time enough for Akari to smooth the front of her shirt and ponder what she would say one last time.

Then the face of Chitose Yuma snapped into existence on the panel in front of her, and her time was up.

They exchanged courtesies briefly, she, Yuma, and Mami, before settling into the topic of the meeting: Akari\'s study of the Seogang‐dong bomb.

\"We\'ve made considerable progress in determining what\'s possible,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the news is not good.\"

\"It turns out the bomb designs we\'re considering are all likely to be possible. In our limited testing, nothing seems to prevent it. For obvious reasons, we won\'t be able to venture a full‐scale test.\"

She had prepared a few slides, and on the presentation screen to her left, she projected a few diagrams of various potential designs.

She glanced around: Mami\'s expression had turned to a serious frown, but Yuma was unreadable. Fair enough; the details of Akari\'s \"limited testing\" weren\'t important to Yuma in the same way they were to Mami.

\"The bad news is, we still don\'t have a good way of defusing a bomb, at least not without the personal involvement of a soul mage,\" she said. \"Some of the more basic bomb designs could be simply disconnected, or blown up, but anything more sophisticated would detonate if tampered with, and I suspect the bomb we already saw was of this type.\"

She played an animation of the bomb activating, and this time Yuma reacted, shaking her head unhappily.

\"But you did say a soul mage could probably defuse it?\" she asked.

\"In‐person,\" Akari said. \"I could probably do it. *Probably*. I could probably also instruct others on how to do so.\"

Yuma made an unhappy noise, leaning back in her chair.

\"I\'ve already written down a few protocols on the matter,\" Akari added.

\"Soul mages aren\'t very common,\" Mami said. \"Even *if* they were all trained, we wouldn\'t be able to get good security coverage.\"

\"The better news is, we now know enough about the likely process to build a handheld detector,\" Akari said. \"In the end, any bomb should just look like a peculiarly‐shaped cluster of magic. It wouldn\'t even be hard to train people to look for it; we have a few mimics to train on. The real hard part is detecting it at a far enough distance, especially* with an enchanted device.\"

She paused, then when no one said anything, continued.

\"Unfortunately, that\'s a real problem. Long‐range magical detection has been a topic of study for decades now, but previous applications have focused on trying to find hidden or distant magical girls. Still, we\'ve been working with an enchanter from Osaka on making the necessary changes, and should be able to produce the requisite detectors soon. It will be time‐consuming, so it\'s not clear how many we\'ll be able to make. And it will be expensive, though I\'m told the GKCY will be able to cover it.\"

\"For the duration of the crisis, yes,\" Mami said, clasping her hands. "Logistics approved a stretch cube allocation, and I\'m sure we could ask for more if needed.\"

\"Less than a solution at best,\" Yuma said, still frowning. \"Not enough people to defuse anything, and everything else is too slow.\"

Yuma shook her head, shifting restlessly in her chair, and Akari sighed, closing her presentation. Yuma was right, but that was the unhappy truth.

\"Well, that\'s good work at least,\" Yuma said. \"Let\'s---\"

Akari blinked as the stream seemed to freeze. She almost asked, then realized that *Yuma* had frozen, stopping mid‐sentence to stare at something in the middle distance, probably on her contacts.

\"Is something the matter?\" she asked.

\"There\'s been a security incident in Mitakihara,\" Yuma said.

She looked through the screen at Mami, and Akari turned her head, realizing Mami had been just as frozen.

\"It was in Mitakihara‐Kazamino International Airport,\" she added. Her tone was even, but just a tiny bit rushed---the tone of someone trying to report dire events calmly. \"A group of high schoolers, new contractees, about a dozen or so, collapsed onto the ground right in the middle of the terminal. They had been on an MSY‐sponsored trip.\"

Akari clasped her hands to her mouth.

\"An attack? Are they alright?\"

\"They\'re fine,\" Mami said. \"They woke up after less than a minute, but obviously it made the news and they had to consent to medical screening. More important than any of that, they say they had a magically‐induced nightmare.\"

Yuma pulled out a tablet and tapped impatiently at it, her face working through a series of expressions.

\"A voice trying to speak to them, a girl being tortured, someone asking them to save their friend---the only consistent part, the one they all share, is an experience of being overtaken by a large, rapidly‐expanding explosion while inside Mitakihara\'s airport. One that looks initially like a high‐energy vertical beam.\"

Mami shook her head.

\"The similarity is obvious,\" she said.

Akari clenched her teeth briefly.

\"Is the vision some kind of threat?\" she asked. \"Trying to demand something?\"

\"Probably not,\" Yuma said. \"More like a warning, the girls say. What clairvoyants we have are converging on the area. Preliminary reports suggest it should be taken seriously, that whatever is going to happen will happen soon. Though whether that means tomorrow, two weeks, or two months from now is tough to say. Which means we have to prepare like there might be an attack *right now*.\"

Mami stood up abruptly, face tense.

\"If we flew back to Mitakihara right away,\" Mami said, leaning in towards Akari, palms flat on the table. \"Do you think you could make a difference?\"

Akari looked back into Mami\'s pupils, feeling a thousand butterflies fill her stomach. Make a difference? Did she dare say it?

*What is the honest answer?* she thought.

She swallowed.

\"Yes, I think so,\" she said. \"We\'ll need a bit of time to scramble a response, me and uh, my assistants. But it\'s incumbent on us to try.\"

Mami stood back up.

\"Okay,\" she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They booked the first commercial flight they could out to Kazamino, getting onto a plane only two hours later.

That was as fast as could be achieved in the circumstances---they didn\'t have any private jets stationed in South Korea---but the wait still drove Akari up a wall, her mood alternating between unbearable and delirious anticipation. They breezed through security, but it made no difference, because they still had to wait for boarding.

Mami noticed, of course, and admonished her to calm down, even though Mami looked a bit impatient herself.

Eventually, she found a way to settle down, working through detection and neutralization protocols in her head until their plane arrived at the gate and she could scan it for any bombs.

They would have to similarly screen arriving planes in Mitakihara as much as possible, as well as scan the perimeter of the airport itself. They could have drones in the air, and try to have agents on as many planes as possible, but was it possible to build so many detectors so quickly?

They\'d have to find out.

\"Akari, you\'ll want to see this,\" Mami said, tapping her on the shoulder.

\"Ah, okay, what?\" she said, startled out of her reverie. She had been unsuccessfully trying to watch a documentary on her laptop, trying to take her mind somewhere else.

Mami gestured at her own tablet, which was frozen on a still of a newscaster talking about Korea. Mami liked to watch the news, a kind of white noise while she thought about the MSY\'s problems.

Akari connected her earpiece and Mami tapped the replay button. The video started over, beginning with a \"Breaking News\" banner that spun across the screen, and followed by the frowning face of a female anchor.

\"The North Korean government has released a statement acknowledging for the first time a role in the terrorist attacks within the South Korean capital of Seoul, including both the Songpa Incident and the recent Seogang‐dong bombing. The statement blames the attacks on rogue elements in the North Korean military, naming in particular General Lee Won‐Sik as the leader of a band of traitorous insurgents. In the statement, the government pledges to purge the traitors immediately.\"

\"While the South Korean government has yet to assign responsibility for the Seogang‐dong bombing, this statement appears to confirm widespread speculation about North Korean involvement. Moreover, the statement dramatically escalates what appears to be an internal power struggle involving General Lee Won‐Sik, whose Second and Third Corps controls a major peninsula southwest of Pyongyang. Reports of combat in the region remain unsubstantiated.\"

\"In a response to the press, embattled South Korean Prime Minister Lee Chung‐Ho expressed skepticism about the claims:\"

> \"Claims by this nefarious government are not to be trusted, and this statement could easily be an attempt to evade responsibility for their evil attacks of late. Lee Won‐Sik could be involved, or he could be an inconvenient general to purge. Until evidence is presented, we must assume their responsibility, and I call upon the international community to continue efforts at providing the maximum possible punishment.\"

*Things are already going sideways,* Mami thought, pausing the video. Can you imagine what an explosion at Mitakihara Airport would do? We could be looking at war, against a nuclear power.*

*Mami, with all due respect, telling me this isn\'t exactly making me less anxious,* Akari thought.

*No, listen, what if it\'s all connected?* Mami thought. *North Korea is a black box to us too, but there\'s no way the girls over there haven\'t gotten control of* something. *The instability we\'re causing---it\'s spreading north. Maybe the North Korean government, or some faction in it, really is responsible for the Seogang‐dong bombing.*

*If that\'s true, what have I gotten myself into?* Akari thought, narrowly managing to avoid relaying the thought to Mami. Not that Mami wouldn\'t hear it anyway, but the difference in intent mattered.

*It could just be a natural response to events,* Akari thought, instead. But if the bombing was by North Korea, what does that mean for us? What can we do about that?*

*Redouble our efforts at negotiation, maybe,* Mami thought, clasping her hands together below her chin, staring into the seat in front of her. I\'m sure there are girls in North Korea who would leap at the chance for the peace and prosperity the MSY can provide, if we could just explain it to them.*

Akari frowned and leaned back into her seat, switching her laptop back to the protocol document she was working on. She could hear what Mami was thinking to herself, worrying about the political implications of the crisis, worrying that it might reinvigorate the Japanists and grind MSY expansion to a halt, especially if they failed to prevent an attack on Mitakihara itself.

Was this the way she was going to make a difference?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Japan, May 2070.* 

By the time they landed, they could feel magical girls scattered through the airport, and a team of mundane and magical escorts waited for them to deplane, guiding them politely towards the terminal\'s administrative offices, much to Akari\'s chagrin. It looked almost like they were being apprehended.

It wasn\'t surprising that they would be setting to work immediately, but something about this seemed even more tense than they had expected.

\"I admit the show of force was probably a bit much,\" Yuma said, greeting Mami and Akari just inside the security doors. \"It\'s unlikely any terrorist would even know to target you. But this isn\'t the time to take chances.\"

\"Has something happened?\" Mami asked, as they broke into a brisk walk behind Yuma. \"I didn\'t expect to see you here in person.\"

\"Not just me,\" Yuma said, as she pushed open the door to an office.

Akari startled as a small constellation of soul gems seemed to appear in front of them, concealed by someone\'s magic.

Her shock doubled when she realized just who she was seeing in front of her. A fair chunk of the MSY\'s senior leadership had turned out. Like Kuroi Kana, new head of the Soul Guard, or Chiyo Rika, Speaker of the Rules Committee. Or Akemi Homura, First Executive.

\"With this kind of turnout, something big has happened,\" Mami said, looking around the small conference table. \"Is it really safe to have everyone here?\"

\"We have an emergency teleport and barrier generators if needed,\" Kana said. \"And if the explosion is big enough... well, it\'s not practical to evacuate the city.\"

*The city?* Akari thought, directing the thought at Mami too.

\"If we tried to evacuate only the MSY and its affiliates, the news would most certainly leak,\" Rika said. \"In any case, Sakura‐san is on the maglev to Hokkaido. That\'ll do.\"

They were given a few moments to settle in, as Yuma handed them some water and snacks.

\"Akiyama‐san here is currently our foremost expert on the \'energy gap\' problem,\" Homura said, gesturing at Akari. \"Arguably our only expert, since we only reopened investigation into the topic recently. Let\'s talk about the news, Kana. No need to waste any more time.\"

\"Right,\" Kana said, tapping the table. A projection appeared on the screen at the end of the room: what appeared to be a multi‐page document, with diagrams.

\"We\'ve received a new threat from the same source that claimed responsibility for the Seogang‐dong bombings,\" she said. \"The manifesto part of it is the kind of stuff you\'d expect. We\'re the evil foreigner imperialists, here to subjugate their country, this is our punishment. Even a charming reference to Hiroshima.\"

\"More importantly, they\'re promising an attack on Japanese soil very soon, though they don\'t specify where. Without any other lead, we have to assume a high chance that\'ll be at this airport, and it\'ll be within days.\"

\"But the reason we called *you* here is that they\'re claiming that they\'ve found a way to unleash \'all of the *real* energy from a soul gem\', and that it would have the yield of a thermonuclear weapon. As evidence, they even included a design, asking us to have our scientists verify. They claim they\'ll hold off if we publicly accede to their demand to leave Korea entirely.\"

\"So, we need to know if it\'s really possible,\" Yuma said, looking at Akari, who had already been handed a paper copy of the threat. "Obviously, it will take you some time to look through, but we\'d like any initial assessment you could give.\"

Akari swallowed to get rid of the tight ball of tension in her throat.

\"Right, *prima facie*, it\'s not *entirely* impossible,\" she said. "Our---our experiments have already shown that under the right conditions, trace amounts of magic can be induced to produce enormous amounts of energy. We also know that the ratio of energy to magic jumps upward almost asymptotically in critical soul gems. Frankly---and this is in the notes we submitted to the Committee---it\'s hard to understand why failing soul gems don\'t explode cataclysmically. We still don\'t have a satisfying explanation. Our best theory was that the Incubators are doing us a favor by suppressing this result, but they deny it on direct questioning.\"

Akari ducked her head.

\"Sorry for rambling a bit. At a glance, this device seems designed to keep a soul gem near critical, so it seems likely whoever these people are, they\'ve reached a similar conclusion. But I have no idea if they can do what they claim. I\'d need time to read.\"

\"So it *is* possible,\" Yuma said.

\"*Potentially* possible,\" Akari said.

\"But likely?\" Yuma asked.

Akari took a long moment, painfully aware of the significance of the answer.

\"No, not very likely,\" she said finally. \"As I said, empirically these kinds of energy releases don\'t happen. I\'d give it perhaps a twenty percent chance.\"

Yuma released a breath. Was it relief? Or something else?

\"I wish it were zero. I hope at least that the airport vision was authentic. If it is, it\'s a huge blessing, since it at least lets us know what to prepare for. But really, there\'s limits to what we can do. We can try to keep the bomb from going off, but beyond that...\"

She shook her head.

\"We have plans for an MSY evacuation of the city, for members and their families. A Condition Four scenario, it\'s called. But even preparing for that would be enormously disruptive and couldn\'t be concealed. Without a more certain threat, it would be irresponsible to do anything more than get a few things ready, not with the risk of provoking a war with North Korea on the table. But it does not sit right with me.\"

She looked at Homura, who nodded in agreement.

\"We\'ve talked to the airport, at least. As far as they\'re concerned, there\'s been a terrorist threat, and they need to be ready to evacuate the airport, and it\'s easy to keep our people out of the airport. Hopefully, Akiyama‐san is right, and that\'s all that\'s necessary.\"

There was a moment of silence while everyone considered what happened if they---if Akari---got this wrong. Akari swallowed nauseatedly. She could not* be wrong today.

\"I want to be clear,\" Homura said, casting her eyes towards her. \"I personally don\'t think a nuke‐like device is possible. I don\'t think this is the kind of energy *anyone* is really capable of releasing. But if you manage to get any greater certainty, we need to know.\"

Akari hid a grimace.

\"I\'m sorry,\" she said. \"But we just don\'t have the theoretical understanding to say for sure either way. I\'m not sure even the Incubators know better.\"

\"They *don\'t* know better,\" Yuma said, even as Akari started to say they should ask. \"The first thing we did was ask. They *did* say no one has ever done it before, but that\'s not really saying anything.\"

\"I\'m sorry then,\" Akari repeated, shaking her head. \"I\'m going to need time to consult with the rest of the lab to be sure, but the problem is, critical soul gems are *not* easy to study, for obvious reasons. We\'d need to conduct more extreme experiments.\"

\"There\'s no time for that,\" Yuma said, a sharp look in her eyes. "Not right now. These people have already shown they can make a plenty big bomb, whatever their claims. Investigate what you can, Akiyama‐san, but the highest priority is making sure no bombs make it to this airport. You should get to work.\"

There was another silence, and when it became clear the meeting was over, Akari and Mami stood to leave.

\"We may call you back later, after the crisis,\" Rika said. \"We need to assess whether broader security measures are called for. That might mean legislative work.\"

Mami nodded, and then they headed for the door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With a good deal of coaxing, the clairvoyants were able to extract a bit more information: whatever was going to happen was probably arriving by plane, probably from the Korean peninsula. Probably.

The lack of certainty was maddening, but there was nothing they could do but try to cover every possibility they could.

Kana and Mami were left to secure the area, setting up a command center in a large maintenance area. Mami worked on setting up a ring of patrols around the airport, both land and air, coordinating with her old colleagues in the Soul Guard in a room filled with diagrams, tables, and guidelines.

It was a full‐scale effort---their contacts within the various airlines arranged to place their agents onto the regular flights into Mitakihara airport, and they bought tickets on the airlines they couldn\'t influence. Yuma reached out to their contacts in the Japanese government to lay groundwork for a potential city‐wide evacuation.

Akari wasn\'t directly involved in coordinating any of that. Instead, she focused on the nuts and bolts, instructing the enchanters on the crafting of bomb detection devices, and the patrol squads on manual detection.

The work, the tension, the chaos---it all wore on her. The techniques they thought they had proven in the laboratory proved maddeningly difficult to teach---magic was finicky and personalized, and they had not* been prepared to train others on such short notice. The patrols they sent out were poor at spotting their test fakes, and the detectors their enchanters built equally bad. They simply weren\'t ready, and so she barely even slept, using magic to keep herself functional.

And all of that was without even considering the real central tension in Akari\'s mind---they *still* didn\'t have a way to reliably defuse a soul gem bomb, not without Akari\'s involvement, and certainly not at range. This meant that if they didn\'t detect an approaching bomb soon enough, it was possible they might as well not have detected it at all.

The last four days had been a mad, caffeine and anti‐sleep‐magic‐filled ordeal, spent *entirely* in the airport. Akari hadn\'t had time to look in a mirror, but she was sure she looked awful.

\"Is it always like this?\" she asked Mami, as they stood on the tarmac at the end of a patrol around the airport.

\"The tension?\" Mami asked.

\"And the chaos, and the fact that we might die at any time, and it will be my fault,\" Akari said. \"And the fact that everything is barely working. I don\'t just mean the detection rates. I stuck my head into your room earlier. It was *awful*.\"

\"Sometimes,\" Mami said. \"But not usually. We\'ve never tried to do anything like this. At least not on this scale.\"

Mami looked fresh, her eyes bright, and if it hadn\'t been for their telepathic connection Akari would have had no idea it was just a very effective front. How was she managing that?

Mami caught that thought from her and nodded slightly, blinking up at the morning sun. They had decided that if someone was going to attack, it would probably be midday, when the airport was busiest.

\"You\'ll learn,\" Mami said. \"If we keep doing this. Having you here makes it better, gives me something to look forward to.\"

She reached out and took Akari\'s hand, and Akari nodded.

\"I think it\'s alright, as long as you\'re here.\"

They looked at each other, and then Mami pecked her on the cheek.

\"Wouldn\'t want to cause too much of a scandal,\" Mami said. \"Come on. Let\'s get some ice cream from the vending machines.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Positive signal on KAL Flight 1150, bearing zero‐three‐two, range miles. All personnel move to respond. Repeat, positive signal on KAL Flight 1150...\"

Akari stopped listening to their conversation, jamming the last of her cone into her mouth. That was a mistake---the surge of electric tension pulsing through her caused her to almost choke on it.

KAL 1150? They had a magical girl on that flight! How had anything gotten so close?

Potential answers snapped into her mind: not everyone they had trained was good at detecting their mock bombs, which themselves were just guesses about how the real bombs worked. If they were wrong---

She cut off the intrusive thought as she and Mami ran towards the back rooms.

\"Flight 1150 has been redirected, yes ma\'am,\" the voice on the radio was saying. \"It\'s being sent to flight level 100 and will be holding over the Pacific.\"

\"Make sure that the pilot is given the right cover story,\" Mami replied. \"Remember we *have* to keep the passengers in the dark to give us time to evacuate the airport.\"

That way, if they failed---if the bomb went off---the loss would hopefully be confined to just one plane.

Akari nervously wiped her hands on her pants. *I\'m not ready,* she thought, the worry emerging automatically from the pit of her stomach where she kept her fears.

She swallowed it. She had no choice. There was still only one person who stood a good chance of defusing the bomb.

The teleporter, Watanabe Tomi, appeared next to her in a puff of smoke, a stern‐faced Soul Guard veteran who nonetheless only came up to Akari\'s shoulder. Next to her was another girl, Yoshida Erika, whose main power was slowing time. Dressed similarly, with identical short‐cropped hair, they made Akari feel painfully out of place.

\"Let\'s go,\" Tomi said, placing her hand on Akari\'s shoulder.

They had practiced three times in the days before. If the bomb was close enough for the maneuver to be performed, Tomi would teleport her to the bomb as quickly as possible, using a magically‐enhanced spotter in the control tower to help aim if a plane was involved. With Erika\'s help, Akari would assess the situation and determine what to do. Very likely, the answer would be for Tomi to send the entire bomb apparatus as far as she could over the ocean---but if Akari could defuse the bomb and save the apparatus, they would gain valuable intel.

There was no time left to think. Akari gritted her teeth as the sky, Mami, and airport swirled away into the smoke.

Akari found herself blinking at the grey metal of an airplane cabin door, nearly elbow to elbow with a uniformed flight attendant, nearly frozen in time pulling something out of the in‐plane microwave. She could only barely perceive the tray creeping outward slowly, and it would be a while yet before the attendant noticed her presence.

She swallowed. She would have much preferred the bomb be in the cargo hold, where they wouldn\'t have had to operate around mundanes, but at least Erika\'s field gave them a certain kind of stealth.

She already sensed the device, its signature obvious despite a layer of magic draped on top in an obvious attempt at concealment. How had anyone missed this?

Grimly, she pushed her way forward, moving aside a passenger waiting for the bathroom---carefully, to avoid catastrophic injury---and making her way into the aisles. The bomb might already be in the initial phases of detonation.

Their agent on the plane, Kobayashi Ume, was on her way too, Erika registering her quickly as an ally and soon immune to the time slow.

Ume pointed at where she thought the bomb was, but Akari didn\'t need the gesture. In the eerie silence of frozen passengers and too‐thick air, it shone like a beacon.

But something else was happening---a girl in an aisle seat started to stand. She looked like she was standing normally, maybe a little cramped by the chair and the passenger next to her---but in slowed time that implied a phenomenal, inhuman speed.

Akari picked up the soul gem reading a fraction of a second later, even as Ume jumped over to restrain her.

The girl put up a struggle, but Ume was much, much faster, and had her limbs pinned behind her almost immediately, though Ume just barely avoided smashing into a passenger\'s head. Instead, they lurched into an empty aisle seat, which shuddered and began to crack.

Akari sought out the soul gem. She hadn\'t expected this---why did the terrorists let the victim stay embodied this time? Was she a true suicide bomber, was that necessary, to access the full energy of the soul? There was no telling what a magical girl could do, even slowed down, but where was her soul gem? Not on the hand, not in any of the usual places. It was under the seat, in her bag---

She froze even as she bent over for it.

No. *No.*

She could feel the ignition sequence starting, and she lunged for the bag, heedless for a moment, churning her own magic outward. She had thought about this, practiced this. The time‐slowing field gave her some room to operate, but not a lot---explosions were *fast*.

The easiest thing would have been to smash the soul gem, and for a split‐second she considered the idea, but then---

Once she got past the concealment magic, it was obvious. The foreign magic was everywhere, its threads weaving through the gem far more insidiously than anything Seoyun had done. Was that an entire *piece* of someone else\'s soul?

*Should I teleport it?* Tomi thought. *It\'s already---*

*She\'s being controlled,* she thought. *We can\'t just kill her. I have to try.*

Could she pull the soul gem out of the device? Could Tomi teleport it out? No, it was too intertwined now. The magic was *everywhere* inside the gem, it could shatter the gem to remove it. The design of the device was just as the terrorists had promised, the full grief cubes alone made the use of any magic dangerous---

*No, get a grip of yourself,* she thought. *You need to release the charge.*

But release the charge where? She had expected that if she was this late, she would abort to teleport. But then---

*There\'s no time,* Tomi thought, strain in her thoughts. *I know she\'s being controlled, but---*

The fabric of the black backpack swelled like a horrible balloon, threads starting to tear, an eerie purple light bleeding out from between the threads.

Akari ignored it, reaching her hand *into* the light, ignoring the pain and heat as it began to scorch her skin to attempt to connect with the soul gem inside.

She blinked away tears from the pain. Not the physical pain---it was just a hand---but of the memories from the soul she was in contact with. Memories and emotions that hovered at the edge of perception as she dove in, deeper and deeper. What had been *done* to her? What kind of monster---

*Teleport me with her,* Akari thought, gritting her teeth. *I can fizzle this. I just have to route it through my own gem. I can---*

Instead, Tomi grabbed her arm, wrenching it away, her hand bloody and blistered, emitting a pale pink light.

*No don\'t---!*

*There\'s no time!*

Akari felt a piercing pain as the bag vanished, disappearing in a puff of smoke. The plane itself vanished a moment later, as they teleported out to the airport.

Many seconds later, a crackling, ominous roar sounded in the distance. The bomb had gone off somewhere over the ocean.

Akari looked down at her hand. Where was her---where was the girl\'s soul gem? She was sure she had it, but...

Rage bubbled up inside Akari.

\"Do you know what you just did?\" she seethed, suddenly lunging at Tomi, trying to grab her with her uninjured hand.

Tomi dodged and snatched Akari\'s hand by the wrist. She sucked in a breath, and they stood there for a long moment.

\"I saved our lives,\" Tomi said. \"Or your life, at least. There was no way that was going to work out.\"

Tomi\'s voice shook with tension, fear, pain.

Mami appeared at their side, interposing herself between the two of them. The message was clear, and a moment later Tomi dropped Akari\'s hand.

Akari tried to swallow her emotion, focusing briefly on Mami\'s ribbons, which now covered Akari\'s injured hand. A wave of comforting warmth passed through it, and she felt it healing.

Akari looked past Mami then, and saw Erika placing the girl\'s body on the ground. Moments away from life, she looked pristine, as if she were taking a nap.

Akari felt herself going limp.

\"Threat is neutralized,\" Erika said over the radio. \"Bomb teleported over ocean, under fallback protocol. Please send teams...\"

Akari let herself fall, allowing Mami to catch her weight.

The only way she avoided crying was by replaying the bomb defusal over and over in her mind. But no matter what she tried, it refused to come out any differently.

*You saved a lot of lives,* Mami thought, in calming telepathy. *Both of you. You have to hold onto that.*

She paused.

*You did well.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *South Korea, May 2070.* 

If only had that been the end of it.

\"That\'s the part I can\'t stand,\" Akari said, gesturing at the viewscreen. \"All of this coverage is so *positive*, like we did everything perfectly. But it wasn\'t perfect. She didn\'t make it.\"

Akari shook her head, feeling the woman\'s eyes on her: Atsuko Arisu, one of the original MHD psychiatrists, and also Akari\'s boss, once upon a time. She was warm, understanding, professional, and on the in with the MSY leadership, for whatever that was worth. Mami had recommended her, not that Akari needed the recommendation.

Arisu was also conveniently in Seoul, as part of a special goodwill delegation.

\"It\'s normal to feel that way,\" Arisu said, peering through her cosmetic glasses. \"It\'s even got a name, as we\'ve been discussing. I won\'t belabor the point by saying what you already know. Just, you\'re not doing anything wrong if you just avoid the coverage. You don\'t have to pay attention to all that.\"

\"Don\'t I?\" Akari asked, looking up at her. \"Isn\'t it part of my job to know about all that? The politics *matter*. Mami can\'t protect me from everything.\"

None of it sat right with her. The wheel never stopped turning, and everyone in Mitakihara had rushed to politicize what had happened, from the administration lauding the \"succcess\" of the Soul Guard and proposing handing out decorations, all the way to the Japanists taking to the air with their smug I‐told‐you‐so\'s. Even *Mami* had gotten in on it.

She had asked Mami to keep her out of the official reports, and let Tomi become the hero of the hour. It was only fair, she reasoned.

Mami had obliged.

\"*Most* of that isn\'t your job at all,\" Arisu said, shaking her head. "Not if it\'s getting to you like this. What matters is what *you* know to be true. You know the Park Tae‐hyun who died there, and it\'s up to you to honor and remember her.\"

Arisu was right, of course. Everything she said was perfectly logical. Akari felt stupid, being so unhappy over what was, inarguably, the most good she had done for the world in her entire life.

And even beyond her personal involvement, practically everything had worked out. The bomb had failed, the energy beam abruptly cutting off before exceeding the power of the one in Seogang‐dong. The incident had been kept off the mundane news, written off as a classified weapons test gone awry. And North Korea had even begun accepting diplomatic overtures---apparently they had captured and executed the general they had pinned Songpa and Seogang‐dong on.

The worst part was, Akari knew exactly why she was being so unreasonable. It was her own fault. She had thrown herself too recklessly into Tae‐hyun\'s soul trying to fizzle the bomb. She had formed a deep, personal connection with her, if only for a moment, and now couldn\'t get over her death.

Akari had learned from her time in the MHD all the established techniques for distancing yourself from your patients\' minds, but they were meant for telepaths, not soul mages. Honestly, she was too far gone to even want to try.

If that were all it took to sever a connection between souls, she wouldn\'t be dating Mami right now.

\"I know,\" Arisu said, grabbing one of her hands. \"But promise me you\'ll try, okay? And come back here if it all gets too much for you. Remember: only work‐related stuff. Unless Mami‐san tells you otherwise.\"

Akari nodded. She had to try.

They said their goodbyes, and she took a deep breath as she stepped out of the impromptu office, casting her eyes out the window at the Seoul skyline, trying to focus on the work she had to get done.

Here in Seoul, the Council had asked for her expertise, had wanted her input on their new security measures. That was her business, whether it stressed her out or not.

And then there were the memories Akari had extracted from Tae‐hyun\'s soul gem---information that could be critical for the investigation. Memories that were painful to look at, that Akari felt almost obligated* to look at, even aside from the investigation. Who else would remember?

She took another breath, steeling herself, and headed for the elevators.

From here, it would be forty minutes through the city, more with traffic. It would have been faster to transform and go on foot, but that was a bad idea outside formal MSY territory, and doubly so now---the Seoul Council had placed the city on high alert, with patrols watching for unknown magical girls. Non‐resident magical girls were requested to restrict themselves to mundane travel to avoid false alarms.

The Seoul Council, and by extension most of the magical girls of Seoul, held \"associate\" status with the MSY now. Often associate groups immediately applied for full membership, but the Council had so far been content to enjoy benefits of association without pursuing a more politically‐fraught full integration. The Songpa incident, and Korea\'s long distrust of Japanese influence, made that proposition controversial.

Akari had hoped to nap during her ride, and not have to think about such things, but her chauffeur turned out to be very talkative. A TNC with a magical girl daughter, one of several in the outskirts of Seoul that had joined the MSY outright, he was eager for reassurances that the various rumors he had heard were false: that the MSY would halt or even reverse expansion in Korea, that the MSY would start a war with North Korea, that Seoyun herself was somehow still alive and responsible for the latest bombings.

Akari didn\'t think she managed to be entirely reassuring. For one thing, Seoyun *was* still alive, though only a few in the Seoul Council, or anywhere else, knew that truth. Akari found herself wondering what Seoyun would have thought of all this, had she not been Reformatted by Arisu.

Finally, she reached her destination, a high‐end restaurant owned by one of the magical girls of the city, the private rooms lent to the Council for its meetings.

Akari looked around as she escaped her chauffeur---magical signals crowded the rooftops, an abnormally high level of security. She could also sense a more familiar, comforting signal: Mami, waiting for her just inside.

Mami greeted her warmly when she entered, telepathically checking up on her at the same time. Akari did the same---it really couldn\'t be said just how much it helped, not permanently keeping all your stresses and worries and frustrations to yourself.

If Mami hadn\'t picked up mind‐reading, this whole Tae‐hyun matter might have strained their relationship. As it was, the damage was largely limited to Akari\'s own mental health.

A waiter showed them past noisy tables full of food and alcohol, up a flight of stairs, and behind a pair of heavy wooden doors. There, a roundtable of girls---mostly in their late teens and early twenties, and not just by appearance---sat in session.

Mami and Akari bowed politely, then took a pair of proffered seats.

*Let\'s get right to business,* one of the older girls thought. *I will speak for the Council. We\'ve read the report your organization submitted to us. It is based on the word of this soul mage?*

They used telepathy to bypass issues of translation, even if Akari and Mami both understood Korean well enough.

*Yes, this is Akiyama Akari,* Mami thought. *You\'ll recall her involvement in the incident with Seoyun.*

*The details you provide here are very disturbing, Doctor. We knew Park Tae‐hyun was missing. We did not know these other details.*

Akari swallowed. Those \"other\" details included memories of capture, coercive soul adjustment, memory wipes, and being turned into a living bomb module. The dry words she had written into the report did it no justice.

*I stand by these words,* Akari thought. *It is unpleasant for me, but I retrieved these details from her soul gem on the plane. She did not deserve what she went through.*

*Indeed she didn\'t. No one does. She was not part of our agreement organization, but we still respect the welfare of our colleagues along the border. This incident has struck fear in all of us.*

Tae‐hyun had been part of a small team operating near the DMZ, and had been reported missing a few weeks ago. Even in that chaotic region, this kind of unexplained disappearance was rare, and it had contributed to unease among the locals.

One of the other girls leaned forward, looking rather young for her position.

*We\'ve already done what we can in the city, and we\'ve asked everyone to register their phones for GPS tracking, but our influence does not extend beyond the city. A more permanent solution is needed for these terrorists, and we want to know what you have to offer.*

Akari glanced at Mami, who nodded slightly.

*What we\'re offering is to take care of the problem directly,* Akari thought. *We have operatives who are ready to deploy and eliminate the threat, even if it turns out to be past the DMZ. We just need your cooperation in tracking them down. I have some of Tae‐hyun‐san\'s memories, and I believe I can help.*

*In addition,* Mami added. *We have teams that can offer training on detecting this kind of corruption, and with your approval, we can deploy some additional security throughout the city. That will improve your defenses, even if it doesn\'t solve the problem.*

The Council turned to look at each other, clearly engaged in some kind of telepathic conversation.

*You will have our cooperation in eliminating the threat, but we do not agree to this other offer,* the older girl thought. *You presume too much. We will take care of our own security.*

This was a predictable response, and Mami hesitated for only a moment before bowing slightly.

*I understand,* she said. *It wasn\'t my intent to offend.*

*Good hunting,* the Council thought. *We\'ll be watching.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tae‐hyun and her two teammates controlled a territory that ran right up against the DMZ. That could have meant a dangerous, closely‐monitored life---some stretches of the DMZ were bitterly contested, often by networks of cooperating teams which could brook no challenges to their authority or intrusions into their territory.

But Tae‐hyun\'s group saw almost none of the fighting. Both sides of their border were rural and sparsely populated, and neither side could risk provoking the other. Instead, they maintained a long‐standing truce, staying strictly on their respective sides of the border, with the occasional cooperation on cross‐border spawns. Thus, they lived relatively peacefully, with routine hunts and regular trade with other groups.

It was this peace and predictability that had led to tragedy. Tae‐hyun had stayed behind from a regular trading trip, busy helping with her grandmother\'s funeral, and then had disappeared. It turned out, Tae‐hyun was a perfect target; all it took was a single suspiciously‐timed event to make her totally vulnerable.

Neither Tae‐hyun\'s team nor her family had seen anything useful, and the local mundane police had turned up even less. Tae‐hyun had gone to bed one day and simply not been there in the morning, only to turn up on a plane landing in Mitakihara with a soul gem ready to explode.

How had a missing teenager successfully booked a ticket and boarded a flight without being detected? Fake IDs, false passports, evading surveillance and pattern detectors---none of that was in Tae‐hyun\'s mundane *or* magical skillsets. Someone had to have helped her.

For a while, this was their only real lead, and they had been forced to search for those who could have helped her, both mundane and magical. Those* were not to be found in Tae‐hyun\'s home region, but in the messy and secretive world elsewhere around the DMZ, a world they knew little about.

They negotiated for interviews with suspect after suspect with limited success, and for weeks they had seemed stuck, a period in which frustration started to hit everyone involved. Mami was constantly under pressure to leave Korea---both to help manage political fallout back home in Japan, and to reassure various new and prospective MSY members abroad---and Akari began to doubt her own place here. Were they going to fail? Despite what she had wished for?

Through it all was also the constant fear of another attack. Even if the terrorists\' nuclear‐scale design had failed, it was plausible they would attempt another bombing, rather than go to ground. Many days passed developing improved detection schemes, and experimenting further, trying to understand just why the bomb had failed. Had it only been because Tae‐hyun had been coerced?

Eventually---thankfully, finally---they made a breakthrough. One of the magical girls they interviewed carried not just the telltale signs of a memory wipe, but also magic traces Akari recognized from the bomb---the girl had been manipulated by the same soul mage into helping get Tae‐hyun onto the plane.

They pieced it all together then, between her memories and Tae‐hyun\'s. The evidence was not straightforward---a mishmash of details about how they had traveled and where they had passed and what weather they had seen, all input into an advanced inference machine---but just one city fit all the details, one that also happened to contain an enchanter\'s enclave, located only a couple dozen kilometers into North Korea, though a surprising one hundred kilometers west of Tae‐hyun\'s territory, beyond the western edge of South Korea itself.

From there, they were able to obtain an enchanted throwing spear sourced from the enclave. It bore no magical traces of their target soul mage, but the enchantment style could be fingerprinted by their enchantment expert in Osaka, and a reexamining of previously‐obtained devices revealed that *most* were products of this single enclave, despite bearing a wide variety of magic signatures. Indeed, the enclave seemed to be impossibly productive, distributing its wares through intermediaries across a huge swathe of Korea---most likely, the soul mage had discovered a way to produce enchanted objects using other magical girls.

Long‐range surveillance by clairvoyants provided the final confirmation, eliciting a pained gasp from Akari when she recognized one of the magical girls in the area from Tae‐hyun\'s memories.

Shortly afterward, Mami returned from a virtual meeting with a clouded expression: the Leadership Committee had weighed the options, studied the intelligence---and then ordered an assassination raid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *South Korea, June 2070.* 

*If you don\'t want to do it, you don\'t have to. I\'m sure we can find someone else.*

*Mami, I\'ll be fine. Besides, it\'s way too late to back out now.*

They were silent for a few seconds, Mami with her hands on her shoulder, searching each other\'s eyes. It was a bit risky, so close to other magical girls, but they wanted the direct telepathic connection.

There was no real need to say anything else. Not really. They\'d been over this ground already, and the truth lurked in the back of their minds, latent behind the telepathy, murky in their eyes.

Akari didn\'t think she\'d be fine. Of course not. She also wasn\'t sure about what she was doing, and she had plenty of fear.

But despite all of that, she needed to go.

*There\'s no one else worth sending,* Akari thought finally. *I know some of their tricks,* and *I recognize them.*

Mami didn\'t say anything further. Instead, she sent a wave of emotions that stung Akari\'s eyes. It helped, that Mami cared---and that she understood. Had been through this herself, more than anyone so sensitive should.

*I want to see this through,* Akari thought. *They killed Tae‐hyun. Who else is going to represent her?*

Mami dropped her arms and took a deep breath.

*Part of the point of all this was that we\'d support each other,* be together, and here you are going off without me. I would go with you if I could. If anyone would let me.*

If she would allow *herself*, she meant. Tomoe Mami, Director of Recruitment and Diplomacy, could not risk her personal safety that far. They both knew that.

*I know, Mami,* Akari thought. *But I\'ll... come back. I promise that.*

Akari turned away and broke their mental connection, then opened the door out onto the rooftop.

Just as the forecast had predicted, it was pouring rain on both sides of the border that night, warm, fat droplets that soaked into the skin around rain gear and through costume. Unpleasant weather even for a magical girl, and they couldn\'t use magic to clear the water---too much of a risk to their stealth.

Dark and rainy---it all seemed suitable to her, and to their task. More so than sun, or even a pallid moon.

She joined the others at the edge of the roof, looking like so many shrouded ghouls in the darkness, looking over an island village in weather no one should be outside in. Visibility was low---no human could have seen the fortifications across the river estuary tonight, even though the northern shore was quite close.

The anticipation set her nerves on edge, and to dispel it she glanced at her companions. There were some girls who had been on the plane mission: Tomi, their now‐celebrity mission leader, face set in a grim mask. Erika, the girl who could slow time, face impassive, pistol on her belt.

Then there was Morimura Kaoru, in a set of armor that obviated the rain gear and would have gleamed in the light. An ornate pair of golden goggles completed the set. She was their spotter---her gaze pierced everything non‐magical, and her range was over a kilometer.

And in the corner was a key part of the team: their stealth generator, Sakamata Hana, in hooded cloak, holding up one hand that faded in and out of sight---practice, she said, and also a bit of a ritual.

A combat complement rounded out the group, specialized in forceful tactics. Three had been flown in from Japan, and chatted among themselves quietly. Akari hadn\'t gotten to know them very well.

There was also the local recruit, a new MSY member, Gang Jung‐min, a dangpa on the back of her robe. At a command, it would transform into a long‐range rifle. Handy for close and long‐range.

Akari hugged herself, wishing it were warmer.

*We have verification,* Tomi thought, one hand on her earpiece. *Clear to teleport.*

She meant that the clairvoyants had finished checking their insertion zone. With any luck, they would insert quietly, no one noticing the spike of magic that signified their arrival.

A pulse of energy, and their stealth field was up. From the inside, they all looked like phantoms, translucent and glowing slightly blue. To outsiders, they would be invisible and inaudible, and the stealth even erased some of the signs of their passing, such as thermal traces and the passage of raindrops.

There were limitations, though: it would not unbreak a window or unsnap a blade of grass, so they would need to move carefully.

The site they would teleport to was well into North Korea, just on the outskirts of their small target city. Satellite footage showed that it was buried in the middle of a large wheat field, sodden under the soaking rain. They would have cover, for now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *North Korea, June 2070.* 

For a moment the group was tense, senses casting out in every direction, even as they strained not to use any magic, and their stealth generator struggled.

Then they relaxed. There was nothing.

*No, wait,* Kaoru said, adjusting her goggles. *I have a signal moving rapidly nearby. It\'s a magical girl.*

A jolt of tension passed through the group again, as their hands tensed on their weapons and they spread out into formation, trying not to move too much of the wheat. It took Akari a mental effort not to use any magic.

Instead, they stood there like frozen ghosts, the blip of magic appearing pulsing over *their* senses too. It didn\'t seem to be heading for them, but it would get *very* close. Who had cursed them with this luck?

The water dripping down her cheek, the rain gear sticking to her face---Akari wanted it all gone so badly, and she almost broke discipline when a wave of magic passed over them.

But nothing seemed to happen, and whoever it was flew away.

*What* was *that?* she thought, finally.

*The plants,* Jung‐min commented.

The plants were taller, Akari realized, somehow resisting the water pulling them down. In fact...

She stepped over to peer at one of the stalks. It was completely dry, and staying so, the water falling off of it as if repelled.

*She came out here to dry the wheat?* Akari thought, stating the obvious. *What, to improve the yield?*

*Probably,* Tomi thought. *You do what you gotta do. And I hear times haven\'t been good around here recently. Let\'s get moving.*

They would move in the direction of the city, working their way carefully through the wheat fields and wilds, Kaoru scouting all the way. When they got close enough to scan part of the city, they would begin to circle, probing inward for their targets.

Piece by piece, new details appeared on Akari\'s headset---some towers by the nearby river, a local winding his way along a trail a kilometer away, distant bunkers---all via an enchanted paper map with a camera pointed at it, Kaoru infusing the necessary magic.

They moved slowly, giving Akari time to absorb the sight of the darkened countryside around her. What she saw was disheartening---much of the land was fallow, and the land that wasn\'t lacked signs of mechanization. They weren\'t close to any households, but she wagered they would look little better.

And then, all too slowly, the details of their target city began to fill their headsets. They had satellite maps already, of course, but Kaoru was able to provide live data---where people were, where there was activity, and eventually, where the magical girls were.

They were close enough now that it was unavoidable that they would see parts of the outskirts. What they saw was pitiful, dilapidated factory complexes that looked like a caricature, something from the imagination of an over‐eager movie director.

*I never thought it\'d be* this *bad,* Akari thought. *I mean, you hear about it, but...*

*People outside can\'t imagine how bad it is,* Jung‐min thought, with a subdued venom. *Or prefer to forget. And people inside try not to imagine how much better it is outside. You do what you have to, to deal with what you can\'t change.*

*Not that I\'ve ever been here either,* she added after a pause.

*It reminds me of a quote I heard once,* Hana said. *The human eye is capable of failing to see even the most glaring injustice.*

Tomi gave them both a look. The MSY might have been awash with the politics of expansion again, but this was hardly the time.

From what they knew, the magical girls here were the ones *least affected by the sudden collapse of grief cube prices in South Korea. They produced enchanted devices, which had retained more of their value, though they did face new competition from abroad. Yet even *they* felt obliged to spend so much magic on local crops.

Akari didn\'t want to think about what the other border cities might look like.

*It doesn\'t matter,* Tomi thought. *Places like these breed monsters, but it\'s still our job to get rid of them. Focus on the mission.*

It bothered Akari a bit, working with Tomi again, hearing her say a thing like that. She still remembered what had happened on the plane, and even if she agreed now with what Tomi had done---well, that didn\'t make it easy to change how she felt.

*Maybe she wants revenge too,* Akari thought.

They began their circuit around the city. Within, the population---too numerous for Kaoru to pick out one‐by‐one---went about its business, which at this hour was mostly sleeping. There was, however, a magical girl reclining on a rooftop, close enough for Kaoru to pass Akari a blurred image.

*Negative,* Akari thought. *I don\'t recognize her.*

The low population of the city was a blessing---there were likely to be around a half‐dozen magical girls, a pittance compared to, say, Pyongyang\'s likely total of over two hundred.

There was a few minutes of tension as they crossed over one of the roads leading into town. Potholed and tech‐free, it was also thankfully deserted. Here, the satellites said they would be getting close to the core industrial zone.

*Another candidate,* Kaoru thought.

*Still no,* Akari thought.

They had nearly completed a half‐circuit when Kaoru signaled for them to halt. She needed to take a closer look at something, goggles glowing lightly with magic that hopefully only they could see.

*Some kind of concentration of magical energy,* she thought a few seconds later, sending a blurry image of an apartment block. *Seems like the enchantment workshop we were looking for? I need to get closer to be sure.*

*Mark the location, but let\'s finish our circuit first,* Tomi thought. Make sure what we\'re dealing with. There\'s no reason to rush. Not yet.*

They found no more magical girls circling the rest of the city, nor any trace of the soul magic Akari was searching for. They would be forced to go closer if they wanted more information.

*I don\'t like this,* Tomi thought. *We should have found more magical girls by now. Not just a workshop.*

Technically that wasn\'t quite true: there were still parts of the city not covered by Kaoru\'s vision range. Still, Akari shared the sentiment, and the unease.

Moving closer meant entering the city proper without having positively identified their target. At that range, it was not safe to take much time scouting. They would have to decide and act quickly.

The water swirled around them as they churned down a sidewalk, getting closer to the enchantment workshop, every member of the team straining their senses.

That was how Akari noticed the pair of humans inexplicably out in the dark.

It was enough for the group to pause, just for a second, as they passed the alleyway. A man and a child, trading each other foodstuffs in the middle of the night, a sack of rice for a canister of powdered milk. Both silhouettes looked very, very thin.

*The government here doesn\'t worry too much about keeping its people fed,* Jung‐min thought. *I heard it\'s worse than usual, recently.*

Akari didn\'t have much time to dwell on the sight, as the resolution of Kaoru\'s scans of the workshop improved. Now she was resolving trace glimmers of magic, obvious pieces of enchantment equipment, and stacked grief cubes.

A shiver of unease, of anticipation passed through their group telepathy.

*We still haven\'t found the actual principals,* Tomi thought. *Not yet.*

But the number of places they could be was rapidly running out.

*We need to take a closer look,* Tomi thought. *But be wary. They could be stealthed like we are, and the building might be booby‐trapped. After all, they shouldn\'t be surprised we might be coming for them.*

*Or we got shit luck and they\'re out,* Erika thought.

*Or that. But we can\'t assume,* Tomi thought.

Normally, a team like theirs would have fanned out, dispersing themselves into a perimeter around the building while a few probed inside. But Hana\'s stealth field covered only about a dozen meters, forcing them to move mostly together.

Akari and Erika moved forward towards the ground‐level entrance, Erika powering her time‐slow field on for the first time, calibrated to avoid affecting the rain.

They had rehearsed this. Erika had the Soul Guard experience with magical traps, but Akari was the stronger magic detector. They would work as a team: Akari would stretch her senses to look for traces of magic---particularly those she recognized from the previous bomb. Erika would try to diagnose anything she found.

Predictably, there was no easy way in. The workshop was on the third floor, in an interior room without windows. If they wanted to maintain stealth, they\'d need to work through the building.

So Akari closed her eyes, letting her soul detach a bit from her senses. Above her, two floors up, parts of the enchantment workshop pulsed silently in varying states of corruption, like flares in the dark. Beyond that, the world was almost dark.

Almost. There was a trace of light, the same color as some she had seen on the plane what seemed like so long ago.

*There\'s something here,* she said, gesturing at a grimy metal box just inside the doorway. *And I recognize it. I think it was crafted by our target.*

Erika moved closer. On closer inspection, it seemed to be an old‐style mailbox.

*Basic detection device. Designed to release a burst of magic if it senses a magical girl. Easy enough to defuse; you just have to drain the charge before it can do anything.*

Erika lanced the mailbox with a jolt of magic from her outstretched hand, ghostly underneath the stealth.

The process quickly became tedious, nervewracking under the time pressure they were under. There was another ward closer to the staircase, then an enchanted security camera, and then a shock device under the floor. It seemed to just keep going.

And still no sign of their targets.

They stashed their rain gear and advanced up the stairway, heading for the third floor, where the workshop was. They moved carefully, inhumanly graceful, followed by the rest of the squad, compelled by the limits of the stealth field to stay a floor below.

At this point they had to assume that the enemy magical girls were cloaked as well, and thus that they might be close enough to spot any minor inconsistency of stealth. There was even the outré risk of colliding with an enemy in the middle of the hallway.

But for now, there was nothing, just dingy hallways and closed doors, including the one they needed to enter.

They stacked up at the edge of the door, Kaoru following closely to scan the inside of the apartment. Here, at such close resolution, they could dispense with the paper map and headset and rely on telepathy directly to transmit an image.

It seemed to be empty. On their immediate right as they entered would be a kitchen counter, suitable for concealment from anyone or anything in the living area on their left, or in the main hallway that ran down the center of the apartment to the other bedrooms.

The living area seemed to serve as the enchanter\'s workshop, with a sofa pushed as far to their left as possible, to give more space for the long table in the middle. The table was cluttered with work materials: bits of wood, metal, and other materials, as well as hand tools. Two desk lamps flanked the sofa, all below a large rack of shelves filled with tools and supplies.

That was all well and good, but first, the door.

An impassive and frustrating metal barrier that stymied their stealth, it couldn\'t be opened carelessly---the large, blatant motion of a door opening and closing would create a visible distortion.

But they could at least try to hide it: Erika\'s time‐slowing field could indirectly mask their movements, especially if they moved with all the speed a magical girl could muster. Combined with an extra effort from their stealth generator, they could pass unnoticed, if no one was looking directly at the doorway.

Erika, Akari, and Tomi took off their soul gems, passing them to one of the combat team for safekeeping. The girl placed them inside a metal box along with her own soul gem, reinforced by a magic barrier of her own design. Then her shield glimmered into place in front of them.

It was always tempting to think oneself invincible behind the protection of so many different kinds of magic, but they all knew better.

The door flashed open and closed in less than half a second, all four of them glimmering through the door and taking cover immediately behind the counter on the right side, in the empty kitchen.

They crouched there, tense, eyes scanning the room. The seconds passed, but nothing happened.

Now Akari began to absorb the domestic details of a home well‐tended to: the tidy countertops, with jars of kimchi set out in a row. The simple wildflowers sitting in a jar on the far cabinet. The controlled mess sitting on the work table in the living area. It wasn\'t exactly how she had pictured the den of a terrorist. She had expected more fanaticism---more pictures of the enemy with spray‐painted targets, fewer flowers. That was stupid in retrospect.

*These people are pretty well‐off,* Erika thought, looking around. Relatively speaking, of course. Extra bedrooms, the top‐floor apartment---what are the chances they traded a few favors for this?*

*Not now.* Tomi thought. *Take a look at their equipment. Maybe we can learn where they are, or at least what they\'re up to.*

Akari stood up out of cover, focusing her attention on the sitting room table, covered with all manner of strange artifacts: metal plates covered in runes, timers connected by wire to metal boxes, even what looked like a few origami birds.

A wave of vertigo passed over her, causing her to stagger in place.

Her instinct was to lash back. The feeling was totally alien, something she hadn\'t felt since she had been young, before her contract, and that terror primed a wave of protective magic, surging out from her soul gem.

Yet still, she paused, her experience pushing her to stop.

There was... someone in the air.

Her breath caught in her throat and she went absolutely still, snapping at her team to do the same. They all went as silent as corpses, shrinking their magic back into their gems.

Akari carefully breathed in. It was as if someone\'s soul had been smeared out, aerosolized. A mist so thin it was impossible to feel, yet the scent so cloying that Akari marveled that she could have missed it. Souls didn\'t usually smell faintly like rotting flesh.

Did it know they were there? Was it being used as a kind of magical sensor?

At her signal, the team readied their weapons, and Tomi prepared an emergency evacuation. If they had been detected, there was a chance that they needed to just blow the workshop and run.

Then Akari spooled the thinnest line of magic she could manage, reaching out to make contact with the wisps of magic emanating in the air.

*Who are you? How are you like this?* Akari asked. *What happened to you?*

Her magic probed its way forward, towards an invisible source, but it seemed for a moment as if she might get lost in the haze, or perhaps that the soul was too far gone for communication.

But then she saw a glimmer, and she seized it, until the light expanded in her mind\'s eye into circling visions of a girl in the crimson robes of the Korean Imperial Guard, fire sparking from her eyes.

*Who goes there?* the soul cried. *You are unwelcome! Turn back!*

Akari felt the soul\'s fire on her skin, saw the trappings of a fortress that had been insinuated into its mind, and realized she had been right: a soul mage had tampered with the soul, manipulating and twisting it into a magical sentry.

*I am Akiyama Akari,* she thought. *And I am not your enemy. You are on false guard.*

Here, Akari knew clever magic would only create more problems than it solved. Any further soul manipulation by her would be destabilizing---traumatizing---and liable to send the soul into full alarm.

Instead, she relied on their nascent soul link, laying bare her own soul: the honesty of her words, her dismay and grief at what had happened to this girl, the fury and disdain she had for its perpetrator.

The girl fell to her knees, hands on her head, mouth open in a silent scream as the realization dawned. Her world had been a lie.

Lines of energy began pulsing through the room, the magic of the sentry system pulsing in rapacious vines that filled the air, hanging from the ceiling as if placed there by an invisible hand. At their root, they drank power greedily from a pair of soul gems, hidden in a case beneath one of the lamps.

There was a stealth system too, Akari realized, and it was starting to fail. The vines and the soul gems had always been there.

*I don\'t understand,* the girl thought. *I was---I was home---in the garden---but then---*

*Just rest,* Akari thought.

Her words dissolved into the girl, who was in no state to resist.

Then the air cleared before Akari, and she let out a breath as she finally sensed their targets, two of them, in bedrooms behind a now‐dismantled stealth field.

But just as Akari tasted victory, the wooden box before them pulsed, a mechanism on the side sending out a great wave of magic. One last failsafe, finally overcoming Akari and Hana\'s magic. Instantly, the two targets jolted awake, magic already flaring.

Telepathy devolved to half‐formed impressions of intent. Erika was the fastest on the draw and was halfway towards the bedrooms when a bolt of white light snapped out of the floor, gouging a hole in the wood and trailing burnt sparks as it went. Despite the slow‐time field, it came breathtakingly close to her head and chest, gouging a spray of blood from her side even as she spun away.

Hana, Kaoru, and a ranged specialist bolted forward before Erika\'s blood had time to meet air---they needed to delay or seal off any escape attempt, and perhaps even get in a sneak attack.

But their actions triggered only more traps, numerous bursts of magic blending together into an incoherent mess as one of their combat mages cleared the room by force, a marble of green magic phasing through the door and ballooning to tremendous size, a maelstrom of air that tore at walls, ceiling, floor---and all the traps lying in wait.

The crash of Jung‐min\'s arquebus shattered the air yet further, joined by a staccato burst of explosions, Tomi teleporting grenades straight from her bag into the air around their targets.

Erika was moving forward again, this time with the barrier generator, Akari joining them to push straight through the still‐spiraling vortex inside a halo of light, barrier advancing down the hallway.

Then the barrier generator slammed her hands down, Erika sliding to her knees just behind, as a pillar of blue, two meters wide and two meters high, slammed into them. The crash of force meeting barrier sprayed off a gout of sparks, blinding Akari---but she didn\'t need to see her targets. She could feel one of their gems, just around the corner---

A crack like thunder for a second time, but not from Jung‐min. The blue pillar vanished, the enemy magical girl was dead, Hana was vanishing back into stealth---

But Akari\'s attention had been drawn abruptly somewhere else, to something familiar, and horrifying.

*That\'s right, soul mage,* their other enemy thought, turning the title into an epithet. *I\'d stay back, unless you want* this *going off right in your face. And taking the entire city with it.*

The thought was desperate, enraged.

*She\'s not bluffing,* Akari thought, beaming the thought to her team. It\'s another explosive device, the same design as on the plane. She\'s powering it herself.*

Their attack froze for a few seconds, an eternity, as they attempted to devise a plan that would let them capture or kill her before she could detonate. Akari herself was stuck a mere meter away from the doorway leading to the other magical girl, but couldn\'t close the gap in time.

But they couldn\'t afford to wait, or negotiate. They had made enough noise to attract every magical girl in the city, not to mention whoever might be in teleport range.

Tomi and Akari shared a glance, and a thought, and the girl holding Akari\'s soul gem passed it forward, as Tomi played for a bit of time.

*You don\'t have to do this,* Tomi thought. *You could surrender, and we\'d take you in. No killing.*

*And become a mind‐washed puppet? No thanks. I know how you foreigners operate.*

Tomi grabbed Akari\'s hand, and teleported her at the enemy girl.

The bomb charged for detonation, but Akari seized a pair of metal attachments in one hand, redirecting the surge of magic into herself. Her breath caught in her throat, as she recognized the girl from Tae‐hyun\'s memories, her thoughts filled with an instant, automatic hate.

The other magical girl\'s fist clipped her face, Akari\'s head flinging backward. Her head swirled and the world spun, as the magic of their two souls slammed into each other, the other girl\'s magic pouring into Akari\'s gem, trying to overwhelm it and allow for detonation.

*Murderer!* Akari thought, uncontrolled over the boundary between them. Everything you do is an abomination!*

*I\'m the abomination? How dare you!*

Akari saw with sudden clarity the other girl in front of her, clothes ragged, hair stringy, but all cared for as best as could be done with little at hand. Her hand held a knife, and the knife was pointed at an older woman, one carrying precious food.

Akari felt the knife enter her gut, blood spraying, and it took everything she had to keep her grip on the bomb, counter the illusion made powerful with real memory.

*I did* everything *to keep my family alive, to keep my loved ones alive, and it was all ruined by you! You Japanese bureaucrats, no different from the party, stuffing yourselves while bankrupting others. A hundred years, the system here has worked, ruined in months, and do you even care who you starved? Fuck you! I\'ll kill you all---*

The girl gasped in sudden pain, as Akari threw her *own* memories forward, the concentrated essence of all the torture and pain Tae‐hyun had suffered at this girl\'s hands, distilled into one, crippling moment.

And in that opening Akari stabbed her magic, needle working its way into the intermingling of their souls at the nexus of the bomb.

The girl stumbled in two places---the bomb warbled and guttered out as Akari\'s magic surged into its circuitry, snapping apart the runes and chasing the thread of the enemy soul mage\'s magic back upwards into her body.

Her gem shattered when Akari\'s magic touched it, filled with hate, and a thousand glittering stars fell to the floor.

It was done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *South Korea, August 2070.* 

The materials were simple, but the craftsmanship was careful, even exacting. In any other context, Akari would have been curious to meet the maker of this memorial.

\"I helped her father make it,\" the girl next to her said, in Korean. "It feels a bit strange, since there\'s no way to explain to them that she\'s never coming back, but I think, deep down, they know.\"

Akari checked the other girl\'s expression, wondering what she intended, but there was no guile there, only a poignant sadness.

Akari closed her eyes, hoping her expression conveyed that she understood what the girl was going through. This was one of Tae‐hyun\'s teammates, Won Min‐ji, one of the girls who had left her behind for what should have been a simple family obligation.

\"I\'m not sure what to say,\" Akari said, replying in Korean. \"I lost a team member once, long ago. She was my seonbae, and...\"

\"No, it\'s not your responsibility to apologize to us,\" the girl said, casting her gaze meaningfully down the way, towards a trio of girls huddled on the other side of the memorial. They *looked* like visitors from the city, with fashionable outfits and the newest models of self‐propelling luggage.

They weren\'t; the outfits and accessories had been gifts from the MSY, to help conceal a group of visiting North Koreans, magical girls that had slipped across the border, with permission from their counterparts on the other side.

Akari swallowed, preparing to speak.

*I know, it\'s not really their responsibility either,* Min‐ji thought. But they came anyway.*

*After you invited them,* Mami thought, walking over from behind the memorial. *Everyone was willing to make the gesture. That\'s always a hopeful start.*

Akari hid her expression, looking back towards the memorial. There, photos of the \"missing\" Tae‐hyun were framed into a wooden assembly, complemented by candles and incense bowls. Someone had left a bunch of fresh flowers on the ground in front.

She was new to this kind of diplomacy, the way Mami had worked to broker this meeting, this... mutual gesture of understanding, that would hopefully be followed by a *real* discussion, and understanding. One that the MSY couldn\'t be disinterested in---they had been the real targets, and the ones to retaliate.

The other of Tae‐hyun\'s teammates gave the signal, and they shifted to their positions: Akari on one side with Mami, while Tae‐hyun\'s team flanked the other.

The three northerners approached the memorial slowly, holding sticks of lit incense. They bowed twice, then placed the sticks into the bowls.

There was a long moment of silence, and then Min‐ji walked to the monument.

*Thank you for coming,* she thought, bowing to the others. *We know it isn\'t easy coming out here.*

Telepathy wasn\'t strictly necessary, but it was wise---the Korean language had diverged somewhat between north and south, after so long a strict separation.

*For something like this, it\'s not a problem,* one of the northerners thought. *In light of recent events, it was only proper for us to come pay our respects.*

Seo Si‐won, Akari was able to recall.

Si‐won gestured at the memorial.

*I\'m sorry about what happened to her. Those in her city knew Choi‐ssi was having a hard year, but none of us knew she was up to something like this. And, well, we had always wondered how exactly she had managed to enchant so many devices, but no one felt it important enough to investigate. To our shame.*

Akari managed to keep her face diplomatically neutral. The truth was, everyone in Choi\'s immediate vicinity *must* have suspected something was up, but many lives had come to depend upon her work. No one wanted to kill their golden goose.

Which made it all the more remarkable that these *other* northerners had stepped in to insulate them from responsibility. It would have been easy for the north to shove all the responsibility for what happened onto Choi\'s city, making it *their* problem.

Instead, the unprecedented had happened: a majority of the border territories had come together to send the magical girls just across the border from Tae‐hyun\'s team as emissaries. In a situation where difficult conditions kept the territories splintered and focused on local survival, this was the first time anyone in the south had seen them come together for *anything*.

*Why didn\'t some of them come themselves?* Min‐ji asked.

*Frankly, they thought you\'d kill them too,* Si‐won thought, without even blinking. *The hope was, you\'d be more willing to talk to us.*

*Respectfully,* Mami thought, *we should take this indoors.*

She tilted her head at a few mundanes watching them from across the street.

They made their way to the local team\'s hideout, in a cramped backroom of a local teahouse, in what *should* have been a disused furniture storage space. Instead, they had a moment to reflect upon the faded wallpaper, bunk bed, and stacked medical supplies. The small table only had room for four.

Min‐ji served tea on a chipped tea set.

*Of course, we\'re not just here to pay our respects,* Si‐won thought, once they all had drinks. *As we\'ve explained, we\'re also here to represent what we\'re calling the North Border Trade Organization. We hope to make it our responsibility to prevent further unnecessary deaths and violence.*

She ducked her head for a moment, seeming to struggle for words.

*The truth is, when I heard about Tae‐hyun\'s disappearance, it really disturbed me. We\'ve never been enemies, out here far from the cities, and I hoped everything would be alright. It made me sick to know what really happened, and that we in the north simply weren\'t taking care of business.*

She paused, gauging her audience.

*But, I would be lying if I said we all got together because of Tae‐hyun. There have been serious discussions for a while about needing to band together. I don\'t know how good the information you have about us is, but we\'re dying up here.*

The last sentence was clearly addressed at Mami, rather than at the Korean team, and Akari watched Mami meet her gaze for a long moment. There was a reason they had been seated across from each other.

*The local trade networks have broken down, is that right?* Mami thought. *Not enough demand for grief cubes?*

*Yes,* the girl thought, picking up her teacup for a sip. *Our hunting territories are unusually rich. This has been enough to help us keep us and our families much better off than they otherwise would be. This has not been true ever since you showed up.*

*And I\'m sorry for that,* Mami thought, without missing a beat. *Much of this is because of our free use of grief cubes to pay local South Koreans. There is already a proposal on the table to convert this into primarily won‐based operations, but it would be less desirable for our members and associates here, and considerably more expensive for the MSY. It has not been easy to convince anyone to commit to that after all that has happened.*

Si‐won tensed, and Akari braced herself.

*You\'re talking about expense when some of our families have trouble feeding themselves!* Si‐won thought, slamming her cup down into the table. *You\'re a fool if you think a message like that will satisfy anyone. Perhaps you don\'t quite understand, but our organization is driven by desperation, not finance.*

The room was silent but for the rattling of her cup, thanks to telepathy, but it felt like the words ought to be echoing.

*I know,* Mami thought, without acknowledging the implied threat. *But we are not the ones who have committed atrocities. We\'d be spending our *resources to support* you. *If it were up to me, we would already be helping. But things are not so simple. It\'s not just about our payments in grief cubes. We\'ve also improved training and hunting practices throughout South Korea. Even without us, grief cube scarcity isn\'t going to come back.*

*Your people have forgotten what it means to be desperate,* Si‐won thought, in almost a growl. *What Choi‐ssi did, the bombings, the kidnappings, that was* not *in a vacuum. We have all suffered. With a response like that, what am I supposed to tell them when I get back? That you don\'t care? That things are only going to get worse? I don\'t think we\'ll be able to do a very good job of holding anyone back, will we?*

The two girls stared at each other for a tense moment, Si‐won\'s eyes seeming to bore a hole into Mami\'s. Akari knew Mami could read the telepathic undercurrents, perhaps even better than she could now---the threat was genuine, not a mere negotiating tactic.

Mami leaned back, folding her hands on the table.

*We\'re not offering nothing. For now, we can offer supplies,* Mami thought, tone firm. *While our organization debates the issue, I am authorized to trade food and other supplies for grief cubes at historical rates. I am also authorized to discuss other arrangements.*

*That depends on what assurances you want,* the other girl thought. We\'re not what you are. We\'re just a voluntary organization.*

She glanced around at the other two girls with her, one of which had been writing notes on paper.

Then, she visibly relaxed, the anger washing out of her face like so much sand, and Akari let out a breath she hadn\'t realized she was holding.

*But your supply proposal may serve for now. We will need time to consult with those still in the north. If we can agree on terms of trade today, then there will be opportunity to discuss other matters.*

*That\'s acceptable,* Mami thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afterward, there was a diplomatic dinner, hosted by Min‐ji\'s parents, who were being well‐compensated---in won---for the task. It was simple fare---pickled vegetables, tofu soup, rice---but satisfying, and the milieu was pleasant. The talks had gone as well as could reasonably be expected.

Which meant that when Mami and Akari finally drifted back into their hotel room, it was with the kind of satisfied exhaustion that came with a job well done.

*What do you think?* Mami asked, turning to drape her arm around Akari. Think we can handle the* next *crisis together too?*

Akari laughed, looking pointedly downward.

*If it will convince you to give me this view again, absolutely. Let\'s make this a lasting thing.*

She felt, rather than saw, Mami nod.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *South Korea, March 2071.* 

The Leadership Council emergency session was scheduled for eight in the evening, mere hours after first news began to arrive from the MSY\'s governmental contacts, and while the rest of the world was starting to receive their breaking news reports. The notice was so short that there wasn\'t time to recall all the committee members from their posts around the world.

Mami knew very little: the North Korean leader was dead, there were mass arrests and tanks in the streets, active combat in peripheral areas---and a new government consolidating its hold on power.

Any other details---well, that was what the meeting was for. She would have preferred to meet in person, but with no time to travel, and leaving Korea at the moment a bad idea anyway, she would have to teleconference.

She stepped into the secure room, tolerating the poking of the guard telepath at the door, which swung closed a moment later, ponderous magical lock sealing with both a clang and a sizzle. Here, behind electronic and magical shielding, they would discuss secure business.

She settled into the surprisingly plush chair, exchanging her personal contacts for a pair soaking in a slot in the table. She waited for a few seconds while they synchronized and authenticated with the equipment around her: a curving optical resolution monitor and projector support equipment, part of a standard executive teleconferencing package, complete with optional quantum security and decidedly *non*‐standard magical protections.

The monitor chimed, and the projection came online, wall projectors augmenting the images on her contacts, relaying an image of the Yamazaki memorial conference room, an ordinary corporate conference room augmented with several priceless wall scrolls and the same kind of security Mami was ensconced in.

The resolution of the pseudo‐holography was a bit lacking; the technology was a work in progress.

She was seated just to the right of the head of the table, where Homura sat, glowering as she reviewed something on her contacts. The rest of the table was nearly full, at least in simulation, CEOs and magnates in public, Directors and Second Executives in private.

Homura leaned forward a dozen seconds later, clasping her hands on the table.

\"Let\'s bring this to order,\" Homura said, blinking rapidly to signal her contacts. \"We have a potential crisis situation on our hands, and we need to decide on a course of action moving forward. Kuroi‐san, would you like to brief us?\"

\"You\'ve all been informed of the basics,\" she said, looking out over the table. \"And what will be more widely known among the public. We have access to more confidential information, filtered through our sources in the Chinese government. The new North Korean government is composed of existing military and political elites near the Chinese border, and they are sending heavy signals that they intend to pursue an opening‐up policy, with close alignment to Chinese interests.\"

\"The Chinese are in turn reciprocating with a warm level of support for the new administration, along with promises of economic aid and investment; their diplomatic assets are making a show of consulting with the new government, and they\'ve already handed over a few opposition members trying to flee the country.\"

\"But opening up *doesn\'t* mean reunification, I take it?\" one of the executives said. \"It\'d be way too soon to suggest anything like that, and it\'s doubtful that the Chinese would support such a move.\"

\"Correct,\" Kana said. \"Though they *are* promising a policy of peaceful development, once the transitional period is over. A bloody transitional period, I would add, with a number of purges and assassinations in recent days. Park Sung‐won has actually been dead for weeks, which is the real reason for the recent military activity. They\'re trying to crush the opposition.\"

There was a pause at the table as they absorbed that.

\"First and foremost, how likely are things to stay stable?\" Homura asked, placing her hand on the table. \"These coup plotters sound like they don\'t intend to rock the boat. That\'s good, since I don\'t want to find out how good we are at stopping incoming nukes.\"

Perhaps Homura intended the last part to be a bit of a joke. No one laughed.

\"The Chinese think they have a decent grip on power,\" Kana said. \"And as I said, they\'re offering their own support. It\'s impossible to say for certain, of course.\"

\"Do we *want* them to stay stable?\" Homura asked, addressing the table with a gesture of her hand. \"What do we think?\"

\"My opinion is yes,\" Shizuki Sayaka said, quick on the draw. \"What this government is promising is the best anyone could reasonably hope for. It keeps things nice and tidy, and it improves conditions for people on the ground. There might even be the opportunity for business.\"

In other words, Sayaka was ruling out a long‐term push for Korean reunification. Not that she was alone in that; for many people, mundane or not, reunification at this point seemed like it would come with nightmarish cultural and economic difficulties, even assuming the political questions could be solved.

\"Reduced tensions and increased Chinese support would go a long way towards helping the magical girls in the country,\" Mami added. \"Not to mention reduced risks and financial burdens for us in managing the region.\"

She didn\'t need to elaborate. The plight of the border girls and their destabilizing influence on the Korean peninsula had become quite a political football, one that Mami herself had kicked more than once. They knew.

She let the discussion linger on that for a bit, gauging the opinion of the room. There seemed to be few willing to disagree with her and Sayaka\'s general assessment, judging by the few comments that were made.

\"Even if we *didn\'t* want North Korea to fall completely into Chinese hands, what could we do about it?\" Tanaka Yui asked, a few minutes later. \"Very little, as far as I can see. Even if we could, as Sayaka says, we\'d be courting disaster.\"

\"Not to mention,\" Mami said, \"that while we may have no influence in the North Korean government, we *do* have influence in the Chinese government, as well as more and more members and associates in northern China. The northern border has always been more amicable and prosperous than the southern---in time, we will be able to expand into North Korea through China, even if the girls near the DMZ remain distrustful of us.\"

\"Or basically,\" Kyouko said, twiddling with a stick of mint pocky, "greater Chinese influence makes reunification very difficult.\"

\"Right,\" Kana said. \"What power they have will be used to suppress its supporters and propagandize against it. Perhaps worse, depending on how much North Korean sovereignty is eroded.\"

\"But what I\'m hearing is that this likely doesn\'t hurt us very much at all,\" Kyouko said. \"Which is good, because I prefer not to mess in other people\'s business. What do the locals think, then? I mean the border girls.\"

\"I haven\'t heard from them yet,\" Mami said, answering Kyouko\'s question. \"But I believe they\'ll be a lot less concerned about the geopolitics than their local economies. If this coup ends up relatively clean, and China improves their living conditions, they\'ll take it. All the better, from their perspective, if they can shake their dependence on aid from the MSY.\"

\"Have your division put together a report for tomorrow once you get in contact,\" Homura said, glancing at Mami. \"Otherwise, it seems we\'re in agreement to let the political situation stand.\"

She looked out over the table for objections. There were none.

\"Alright, what about South Korea?\" she asked. \"Tensions have been high recently. How are they taking the news?\"

\"Too early to say,\" Mami said. \"They\'ve barely had time to receive the news. But I\'d expect wariness and pessimism. They\'ve been very on‐edge since Seogang‐dong, and I\'d think a coup in the north is the last news they want to hear, whatever the new government is promising. I\'ve seen the internal plans; they\'re worried that if the north falls apart, they won\'t be ready for what\'s coming, despite all their preparation.\"

\"Us neither, I\'d say,\" Sayaka said.

Homura shook her head, clasping her hands together.

\"We still need to be prepared for the eventuality,\" she said. \"Now that we\'ve stuck our hands into the pot, I think it\'s safe to say we\'ll be on the hook if the worst happens. Let\'s put a plan together, work out how many refugees we might have to take.\"

There was little to disagree with there, but as the conversation shifted, Mami couldn\'t shake a sense of... not quite foreboding. More that they simply weren\'t covering all the angles, that they *had* to be overlooking something. There were just too many unknown unknowns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *North Korea, April 2071.* 

*Well, we avoided the worst‐case scenario,* Akari thought. *Which counts for something. Here\'s hoping it doesn\'t get any worse.*

*It\'s our job to make* sure *it doesn\'t get any worse,* Mami thought. Though I guess that\'s a bit cliché to say.*

She sipped her tea, a surprisingly decent blend given that it had come from a jug in an airport lounge.

More specifically, a lounge in Pyongyang, North Korea, where they were waiting for a plane to take them back across the Chinese border. With them were a bunch of civilian businessmen, and two official emissaries, one from China and the other from South Korea. *They* had just gotten back from talks with the new government. Mami and Akari...

Well, they had done that too, in their own way.

*Things are still cooling down, though,* Akari thought. *It will be a while yet before we can really breathe easy.*

The DMZ girls had turned out to be surprisingly split on the situation. Most seemed pleased by the influx of Chinese aid, as they had guessed, but some had been very cool, or even hostile. One of the friendlier girls confided in Mami that some suspected that the Chinese coup was also an MSY plot, a way to extend its tentacles deeper into the country---but that she was sure they\'d come around.

It didn\'t help that a new organization of North Korean magical girls had, in fact, met with Chinese MSY associates in Dandong shortly after the coup, asking for help putting together their own associate application to the MSY. Based mostly in the northern parts of the country near the Chinese border, they claimed to have contacts high up in the new government, and to have even done some of its dirty work, with the aid of a few key members based in the capital.

Very big claims, and plenty to be skeptical of, but they had produced plenty of evidence, and three weeks of vetting had found only corroborating details and consistent details. Finally, the MSY had sent a trio of envoys to Pyongyang, who had reported back that everything seemed to be just as claimed. So too had the next five they sent.

So Mami had made the trip herself, piggybacking on their mundane connections in the Chinese government to make everything a bit more official. Misgivings by the DMZ girls aside, the opportunity was far too good to pass up.

Akari had to admit, she hadn\'t exactly looked forward to visiting the world\'s most reclusive and notorious state again, but it had all been tolerable enough. The country was, unsurprisingly, a lot more welcoming when you weren\'t there to kill people.

*I have to say,* Akari commented, leaning over to put her head on Mami\'s shoulder. *After all this, I\'m* really *looking forward to Italy.*

Mami smiled, even as she rolled her eyes.

*Who wouldn\'t?* she thought, patting her head. *You\'re not the one who has to wrangle with the Europeans---there\'s a copycat organization that\'s gaining ground there, you know. But, I\'m looking forward to it too.*

An announcement sounded over the intercom. Their plane would be boarding soon.

*How is the investigation into Choi\'s devices proceeding back at the lab?* Mami thought. *Any new revelations?*

*Not yet,* Akari thought, without shifting position. *Hina‐chan\'s still working on the bomb apparatus we recovered from her, trying to repurpose it for another energy gap experiment. We\'ve also gotten a couple test subjects signed up to let me attempt enchantment through them, somewhat like Choi did, but my hopes aren\'t high for that. It\'s far too invasive for the quality of product we expect, at least with my powers. I\'m more excited to be helping Hina‐chan with her work.*

Mami nodded, slowly, her hair brushing Akari\'s face.

*Always plenty to do,* she thought.

Akari sighed, wondering if now was a good time to fall asleep. She was Mami\'s security, but she had already done the rounds earlier, inspecting their plane both inside and out. There hadn\'t been even a whiff of magic.

Instead, she zapped herself with a bit of magic, ensuring she was awake and attentive. Not many things could happen in an airport lounge, but one couldn\'t be sure.

When it came time to board, neither she nor Mami could find anything on the passengers or any of their luggage, either in line or on the plane itself. They even strained their telepathy for signs of malice among the passengers.

As for mundane security---well, for that they\'d have to rely on the security of the Chinese envoy. In his own words, he was getting on the plane too, and with him the interests of the Chinese and North Korean governments. They had every incentive to make sure nothing went wrong.

She settled in her seat next to Mami, looking back at the front of the wing. It was funny, in a way, for magical girls to be taking an airliner.

Then she looked over at Mami, who was hunched over frowning at her tablet, reading a piece of the mundane news, eyes intense.

There was nothing special about the moment, but she felt in herself a wave of warm affection, and in it she realized something.

She was happy here.

She shook her head at herself, and looked out the window again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Japan, April 2071.* 

Homura glowered down at the images below her, drone stills of the plane crash that had almost killed Mami. That *had* killed her soul, in a way, by killing Akiyama Akari, whose body Homura forced herself to look at.

There were other pictures too, pictures of the rampage Mami went on afterward, before they were able to recapture her, the damage severe enough that it could only be covered by the widening North Korean civil war.

\"We were too damn careless,\" she said. \"A conventional bomb! We couldn\'t see that coming?\"

It was the end of the day, the sunrise pouring through the windows of Homura\'s high‐rise office. That meant there was no one else in the room, and she was free to speak to the person whose opinion she valued most.

\"Of course I don\'t blame myself,\" Homura said. \"I blame all of us. We\'ve been too complacent, too secure. Things have been going too well.\"

She didn\'t need a two‐hundred‐page report to tell her that, even if there was one sitting unread in her computer.

\"I know,\" she said, a moment later. \"The cynical way to look at it is that it\'s just Mami, and she even lived, right? We salvaged her. The organization is fine. But neither of us is willing to say it is *just Mami.\"

Homura shook her head.

\"I liked Akiyama‐san, you know. You can tell her that for me. They looked happy together. She was a good woman. She was just looking for her place, and Mami was just looking for togetherness. Now Kyouko, Yuma, and I will be the ones going to the funeral instead, because Mami is...\"

She gestured emptily with one hand, then dropped it back down, unhappy.

\"North Korea is in civil war,\" Homura said. \"People are dying. Everyone is wondering about whether there needs to be an intervention, but there are nukes on the board. We\'ve had to start putting up our own patrols. Magical girls! For nukes!\"

For a moment she forgot herself, one arm waving in the air, hair flying.

She settled herself, stepping towards the windows that opened out onto the Mitakihara skyline. From here, it was all too easy to entertain the delusion of being in control.

\"We\'re putting a new proposal on the table, for the intelligence agency Yuma and I have been pushing for. After this debacle, we\'ll have plenty of support for passage, even if it requires a few tweaks to the Charter. It just makes too much sense.\"

\"Yeah, the name is awful, but it was Yuma\'s idea,\" Homura said. "Though I daresay it gets the point across.\"

For a long time she looked out the window, at the massive urban confluence below, poor and rich alike, trying to process it all. What was one person in all of that, even someone like Mami? A cog in the machine, one Homura had reshaped by force.

\"We\'re sealing the records,\" she said. \"Akiyama\'s research will go cold, again. At least for now. It isn\'t time yet.\"

A thought in her mind, an intrusive one. She herself was still here, as part of the plan. Mami had suffered, as part of the plan. She would be here, someday, when Mami\'s memories of all this needed to come back, when the time was right.

Homura was nearing ninety now, if one counted her time outside this world, which she did. Events showed no signs of slowing down. How long would she be made to wait? This wasn\'t where she wanted to be.

\"How much longer must I wait to see you?\" she asked. \"Can no one take my place?\"
