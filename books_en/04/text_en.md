The military simply wasn\'t a priority; the EDC had eliminated all internal threats, and there were no known external ones.

By the time of the Battle of New Athens, the armed services had grown nearly thirty‐fold in size, counting nearly ten million in well‐equipped, if only hastily‐trained, volunteers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How had it come to this?

Mami tapped her fingers incessantly against the table of the General Staff\'s meeting room on board Carthago, combat reports flowing into her mind.

The pulsar fleet was trapped, unable to stabilize the wormhole. Their primary objective had already been abandoned---now the question was not of mission success, but whether the huge investment into Project Armstrong\'s jumpstrike capability would be completely lost.

What had that accursed Goddess meant when she said she had a \"positive feeling\" about the pulsar mission?

As bad as that was, Mami had at least prepared for the possibility. The same couldn\'t be said for the *other* combat situation. What in the hell were Yuma and Kyouko thinking, gallivanting off in the middle of nowhere, getting attacked by aliens?

Were they going to die, while she just sat in a cushy chair a hundred light‐years away, unable to do *anything*? Was that going to be the story of her life?

She had to exert magical control over her body to keep her emotions from overwhelming her, to keep the fear for her friends from physically shaking her.

She felt the eyes of the other marshals and admirals on her, Feodorovich and Anand and Sualem, the three she had pulled from their other duties to watch over the pulsar mission with her. Feodorovich and Anand because they were her supporters and had been part of the planning, Sualem because he had been putting real effort into making his criticism more constructive, and including him was a cheap political sop to his faction in the General Staff.

She regretted inviting him now.

\"Your distress is understandable,\" Sualem said, avatar severe in its virtual chair. \"But a military setback of this sort is unavoidable sometimes in war. It was a reasonable gambit.\"

How generous.

\"As for this incident near Yenisei,\" Sualem added. \"I can only hope that your colleagues know what they\'re doing. They\'re all experienced enough not to be foolhardy.\"

Mami stopped tapping her fingers for just a moment. Sualem really was being *diplomatic*, for once, when she knew he was thinking much worse. Did she look that out of sorts?

*Whatever,* she thought. His opinion didn\'t matter right now.

Feodorovich let out a breath.

\"To move forward,\" she said, \"I understand that MSY prerogatives are in play here, but we must know what it is Chitose Yuma intended to accomplish at Yenisei, and how it was that the aliens knew to attack them in so unusual a location. They may not have accepted military oversight, but I think it\'s fair to say that now that they\'ve asked for our help, it is our right to know.\"

Feodorovich looked at her piercingly, and Mami knew she had no choice but to meet her gaze head‐on.

\"I don\'t know what they were up to,\" she said. \"I want to know as much as you do.\"

\"Perhaps---\" Anand began.

The avatar of the Carthago Shipyard station AI, Alan Turing, appeared at her side.

\"Pardon the interruption,\" he said.

Mami had a fraction of a second to wonder why the AI would show up in person before new information flooded her mind: a full report from MG, about what Yuma had discovered, and the hostile reaction that had just been triggered.

She immediately began sliding into Command Mode, as Anand\'s and her bodyguards teleported into the room. They needed to reach interface chairs, *now*.

But even as Mami arrived in her new room, they were forced into a painful pause. They couldn\'t be sure the interface chairs were safe until they were verified, no matter what MG\'s report said. Only Mami and Machina, magically protected, were provably clean now.

Feodorovich\'s and Sualem\'s avatars appeared again before her, after a delay due to them *also* switching locations.

*I\'m dividing this into four separate assignments,* Mami thought. Machina, confirm the validity of MG\'s report, and begin verification on the others\' communication lines, implants, TacComps, and interface chairs, starting with Feodorovich.*

*Mami‐san, is it wise to wire in right now?* Xiao Long, Mami\'s teleporter, thought at the same time. *Yenisei is clearly an assassination attempt on senior MSY leadership. You might need to stay mobile.*

*Feodorovich,* Mami thought, hesitating in front of her chair, *once you\'re cleared, take command of the response to the attacks being reported. Assume they\'re real.*

*That risk isn\'t worth losing the power of direct cluster access,* Mami thought, sitting down to prepare for connection. *The interface will take time to verify anyway. If there\'s an attempt on my life too, it should be obvious before then.*

*Anand,* Mami thought, without interruption, *begin emergency recomputation of humanity\'s strategic and diplomatic posture conditional on the most plausible interpretations of the video Yuma extracted. Decide if we should attempt to send a diplomatic message to the Ceph via the Project Armstrong wormhole before it\'s gone---this may be our best chance to get a message past the front lines.*

A preliminary result came from Machina: the TCF breach appeared genuine. One of Anand\'s bodyguards could perform magical TCF verification---had been secretly reassigned to Anand by Yuma for this purpose, in fact---and claimed to have pre‐verified that Turing and Carthago were clean.

Mami ordered that this Johanna Genoveva be teleported to her, untransformed, so she could begin a telepathic check.

*Sualem,* Mami thought, *identify the most damaging possible misinformation the General Staff could have been fed, working backwards from now, and cross‐check the data we have with verified AIs as Machina confirms them.*

Mami herself attempted to get a grasp on the bigger picture. The vision of Homura she had seen in the séance on New California, the fact that a TCF breach meant they had a *magical* enemy---

〈*We\'re getting conflicting reports of rogue activity on Armstrong Defense Station from Luna Command Node,*〉 Machina thought, on an emergency interrupt level. 〈*Unauthorized launches and kinetic firing. We---*〉

A few milliseconds of silence.

〈*Carthago is under attack from lunar and orbital weaponry. Much of our orbital defensive systems are offline. Forcefields will be down to in thirty seconds.*〉

The calculations ran through her head in an instant.

*Then we need to get out there,* she thought to her bodyguards. There wasn\'t much in the way of manned, magical girl defense in Earth orbit, for obvious reasons. It would take only a short while for Earth OrbCom to reassert control, but that \"short while\" was plenty of time to die in.

*You\'re sure Turing is clean?* she asked Johanna, who had just arrived.

*Yes,* the girl said, balking slightly under Mami\'s harsh and hasty telepathic scrutiny.

*Then we\'ll have to trust in that. Let\'s go.*

As the rainbow tunnel of Xiao Long\'s teleport swirled around her, she reflected that nothing on board Carthago was truly irreplaceable. Not even herself or Anand. But the potential loss in prestige alone...

A nervewracking ten seconds were spent slapping on a vacuum suit, magical girl speed barely giving time for the suit segments to assemble.

Then they were out in space, for the first time since her orbital training early in the war. Earth loomed below her, Asia and the Pacific Ocean in view.

Mami absorbed what information she could about the incoming threats.

*Johanna, work on reversing the corruption in the local defense network, and see if you can deactivate some of the missiles. Karina and I will focus on the kinetic projectiles.*

Carthago wasn\'t the only target at risk, but it was the only one Mami was capable of personally defending. She had to hope that Earth OrbCom was not too compromised---it had some of the heaviest orbital weapon systems Humanity could deploy, some designed to counter alien battlecruisers. These naturally tended to be pointed *outward*, but there was no telling what a malicious adversary could achieve.

For now, their adversaries seemed to be doing whatever they could to cause chaos, targeting both kinetic and missile weapons at Carthago, and even aiming satellites directly at them.

Mami took a breath underneath her helmet, spreading her hands out in front of her.

A wall of ribbons appeared before her, a few square meters in size, woven into a meshwork with no gaps. It *looked* like it couldn\'t stop a simple bullet, but the looks were deceiving---the wall would be just as effective as Kyouko\'s chains, which it was an imitation of.

Mami frowned at the thought of Kyouko, who was in far graver danger than she, but shook it off quickly. Now---especially now---she couldn\'t let herself despair. Not when she had expensive magic to perform.

She pumped magic into her ribbons, her soul gem rotating through the supply of grief cubes in her suit. First, the ribbons turned translucent, so her team could see what was happening. Then the wall spun outward, doubling in size, then redoubling, until it stretched kilometers and curved inward, shielding a significant fraction of the station.

A drone from the station delivered more grief cubes, and Mami accepted them gladly as her barrier shuddered under a series of blows, ribbons flashing bright yellow under kinetic impact.

*Mami,* Machina thought.

Mami was already looking to the sky, away from Earth, the signal entering her brain.

The Super Heavy Elliptical Lunar Array, SHELA, was an experimental array of defense cannons in lunar orbit, designed to help turn Earth\'s natural satellite into a fortified planetary body in its own right, denying access to lunar orbit while simultaneously supporting Earth orbit with long‐range strike power, some of it at relativistic velocities.

And elements of SHELA that happened to be pointed in the general direction of Earth had started turning and firing. It had just taken a while for them to notice with so many things going offline.

Not all of it was directed at Carthago, Mami realized. Some of it was towards other assets in orbit, including the space elevators near India and Southeast Asia, whose OrbCom defenses were not yet back online.

*I can\'t do anything about that,* she thought. For all her years, fleets, and powers, it was entirely out of her hands.

With no one around, she screamed in rage. For her friends, for all her frustration, for all the disasters, she launched herself away from Carthago at the main projectile incoming.

She could at least do something about this one.

Directly stopping a relativistic projectile with megatons of relative kinetic energy was a difficult task, especially when she had less than a minute to do it. But deflection... that was possible, provided she did it far enough out.

Machina had already run the numbers. Ideally, she could fire a Tiro Finale from the side---that would be relatively cheap, well within her firing capacity. There was the targeting challenge of hitting a bullet with a bullet, but she had the intuition to manage it.

A part of her longed for this solution, to just rocket outward at maximum speed and deal with the problem nearly head‐on. But, angry or not, there was no way her shot could reach the impacter at enough distance---ideally almost a quarter of the way to the Moon---much less hit it from the required angle.

Instead, she\'d have to do something a bit less kinetic.

She reached the position Machina suggested, giving her a clean shot past the maze of satellite and other trajectories above her. Settling into place, she readied her stash of grief cubes, listening to her own breathing to center herself, and be ready for what she had to do.

She was a master of crafting with her ribbons, and while one of her first achievements was fashioning muskets, she had never stopped tinkering, growing proficient at summoning other objects, while reading about machines and weaponry to expand her knowledge of *mechanism*.

Once, early in the Unification Wars, Yuma had suggested it would behoove her to learn to perform laser ablation interception. She was one of the few magical girls qualified, and it might be useful someday.

She had been right, of course.

Mami gritted her teeth and reached forward with one hand, summoning the requisite parts *ex nihilo*. She wasn\'t as practiced with this as with her usual cannon, so it took a bit of doing: stabilization brace, followed by resonance chamber, followed by focusing lens.

When you could afford the energy, doing things this way made things a lot simpler. If you could afford the energy.

*You\'ll be running up against the line, Mami,* Machina thought. *I\'m estimating two million kilojoules. That\'s a lot, even for you.*

*It won\'t be all at once,* Mami thought. *And Xiao Long can deliver emergency grief cubes if I miscalculated. I\'m in no mood to sit back and let things happen.*

She narrowed her eyes, peering out into the void where the impacter would be. Naturally, she would be leaning on Machina\'s calculations, but she had always found that a magical girl could get unexpected value from a direct look.

Mami tried to clear her mind, emptying herself of everything but the task at hand: the thrum of magic in her veins, the targeting solutions in her mind\'s eye, the slight actuation of the weapon in front of her, now easily three times her size.

Then she performed a trick she didn\'t like very much---she pointed her magic at herself, letting it focus her mind on only the most optimistic scenarios. She let it wash over her, imagining all that might happen, the way she would scold Yuma when she returned, a smile hidden in her heart. She let her heart swell with hope.

*Luce Solare!* she and Machina thought together, in resonant chorus.

The magical beam streaked outward, painfully‐bright yellow with photons that only magic could afford to waste. A quarter‐second later it slammed into the left half of the impacter\'s face, vaporizing the metal composite and ejecting it as gas. There were no efficiency losses---the intent of her magic ensured it all ejected in *just* the right direction and velocity.

She turned ever so slightly, tracking the projectile for over a second, gritting her teeth against the pain of the grief filling her soul.

Then she was done: the impacter was off course, due to hurl harmlessly past Earth into deep space.

Only then did she realize that it had been too easy.

A feat like that should have drained her to the limit, even with all her extra grief cubes, just as Machina had warned. Instead, she had never felt threatened, and still had most of her supply---at this rate she could have repeated the feat twice over, and comfortably at that.

There was only one thing---one person---she knew which could cause an effect like that. It had been hidden well, but now that Mami knew to look for it, she could *sense* her.

*Akemi‐san, Homura, is that* you? she thought desperately, on broad channel telepathy. *Answer me!*

There was no response, and however much her heart demanded she try to track Homura down, she suddenly had much bigger problems.

Sensors indicated no less than six more impacters on approach trajectory, what would have been an impossible defensive task just half a minute earlier. Instead, assuming Homura\'s magic stuck around, she might *just* be able to fend it off. Maybe.

Or she could evacuate herself from the area, leaving the station to its fate.

*No,* she thought. If this was important enough for *Homura*, of all people, to reappear, then she would stand her ground. Humanity needed a victory today. *She* needed a victory today.

*I\'ll take your help,* Mami thought, again on broadband. *We\'re going to make our stand here. But where have you been all these years? You\'re not going to run away, are you? Whatever you\'re doing, whatever you\'ve suffered, we can help you.* I *can help you. I want to make up for before. You need to talk to us!*

She injected the thought with all the emotion she could, and made clear who it was intended for.

Then she threw herself into her task.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shizuki Kuma was taking a lunch break.

The Prometheus Research Center had the good luck to be located near one of Mitakihara\'s only open spaces, the swathe of air space claimed by the Cult of Hope just next door. That meant that many of the windows on that side of the building had *just* a bit more light, and some even had an angle to see the church and its garden below.

He was seated to take advantage of that light, watching a video his ex‐wife had sent him, of a little girl posing proudly next to a model house.

The situation with Sacnite was awkward at best. He had had nothing to do with the adoption, of course, but Ryouko was his daughter too, so he had been willing to be a bit involved. What did that even *mean*, though?

The video was interrupted by a piercing alarm, sending him jumping instantly out of his seat without even knowing why. It took him a fraction of a second to register that his emergency package had toggled online, and that it was the military emergency alarm, ringing both in the hallways *and* in his head.

He joined the stream of personnel heading for the evacuation ports, all of them frantically messaging speculation at each other about what was going on. No one knew who had called the emergency, Darwin was unresponsive, and the only information they had was that some kind of attack was imminent. But this was Earth!

The building shook as they spilled onto the local skyway, sending some of them stumbling. A thundering crack then shattered the air, removing any doubts they might have.

There was no screaming, their emergency packages focusing their attention on the bare task of survival. Most of the civilians already outside sprinted forward, trying to get out of the area, but those who were stuck near the doorway, like Kuma, didn\'t have stable ground to run on. Instead, they toppled sideways, grabbed nearby objects and each other, and braced for a very forceful fall.

Kuma felt like he had been forced into a distant, illogical movie, the world reeling slowly sideways as the building above him tilted at an impossible angle. His fear---and it was tremendous fear---had been locked away in a deep, irrelevant box, and he finally reflected that he was very likely to die.

They began to go into freefall, and Kuma\'s implants began trying to calculate whether he was better off just letting go of the railing to find something, anything else to land on, for what little difference it would make with the building coming down on him.

The conclusion was yes, and he and several others used what little leverage they had to push away, grab each other, and influence their angle of fall. They succeeded in veering a few degrees, so that the woman next to him slammed into the side of a traffic tube with a sickening crunch---mercifully, she had turned herself off just a moment earlier, and her situation was salvageable, if nothing else happened, which was a laughable notion.

They bounced off, and now they were going to land on a neighboring skyway, about fifteen meters down. A passing small drone gave them the tiniest of assists, grabbing onto Kuma\'s arm with all the power its engines could muster to slow the fall.

They slammed into the skyway, protecting the already‐injured woman as best they could, pain receptors completely disabled.

Most of them went into unconscious fugue immediately, but Kuma clung on, one of the least injured, now responsible for taking care of the others if at all possible.

Of course, there was nothing he could do, and both he and his emergency package stared emptily at the giant shard of building falling inexorably towards them, before his implants nudged him: something was wrong. Or, perhaps, *right*. The building wasn\'t budging.

He scrambled at length onto his knees, gratefully receiving a package of medical nanites that a passing drone had flung onto the floor in front of him. As he started to work on one of the crumpled bodies next to him, one of his own hands hanging broken and limp, he looked up at the looming, impossibly hovering building above him.

There was only one possibility, of course, and he could see the girl holding up a huge chunk of the building personally, hands pressed into the side while she braced against the side of another structure. Someone else walked up the top, seeming to vaporize segments of the building as she passed.

He took a moment to stare, and his nomenclator returned:

*Identification unknown: no match with confidence greater than fifteen percent. Submitting for additional processing...*

He turned away and returned to his gory task at hand. By the time proper medical drones arrived minutes later the girls and building were gone, leaving him to slip into grateful fugue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"The disaster in Mitakihara has been accompanied by security incidents throughout Governance space, suggesting an attack of unprecedented scale. Ongoing outages in Governance\'s network management have allowed multiple multimedia statements by an unknown organization claiming responsibility. These statements have made shocking allegations about Governance and the MSY, which we have not yet been able to verify. Official sources have thus far stated only that the situation is under control and the damage limited, with negligible effect on the war effort. However, a joint press conference by members of the Directorate will begin in just three minutes, promising a full response to the allegations---\"

Kuma paused the stream, acknowledging the visitor that had stepped through his doorway. His injuries had been relatively minor---minor enough to allow him to regain consciousness just half an hour later, in an MSY Military Armory hospital bed beneath the Cult of Hope.

\"Shirou‐san,\" he said, nodding politely at Shirou Asaka.

He spoke evenly, but ever since the hospital systems had warned him of her approach, he had been desperate to work out why *he* would be worth visiting. It couldn\'t be personal; they barely knew each other. Was it something about all the clones that had just been lost at Prometheus? Or was it---more likely---something about his daughter?

He had given up trying to find the actual allegations the news kept talking about---it seemed the Cult of Hope\'s systems weren\'t having outages---but he had a terrible feeling that Ryouko was wrapped up in all this.

\"What brings you here, if you don\'t mind me asking? I don\'t think I warrant a Major General.\"

Asaka looked to the side.

\"Well, I also have my own business,\" she said. \"I thought it was worth a personal visit.\"

She sat down and then leaned back in her chair, casting her eyes upward.

\"I\'m being impolite,\" she said. \"But I\'m in a hurry. Still, I will give you the courtesy of a little background. Earlier today, I was at the Church of Hope, and while I was there, everyone---and I mean everyone---in the Ribbon Chamber experienced a vision, myself included, warning us of this attack. I doubt you put any stock in the Goddess, but you owe Her your life---that vision is the reason we were able to order an evacuation.\"

\"What?\" Kuma said.

\"Was it wrong?\" Asaka asked, pinning him with a look. \"But enough of that. While Prometheus was collapsing, our rapid response teams detected a number of unknown magical girls in the area. You were in the vicinity of one, and there was an unusual nomenclator request. Can I telepathically examine your memory of the incident?\"

The memory flashed through Kuma\'s mind, of the girl holding up a building on her own, unidentifiable.

\"Of course,\" Kuma said, so relieved that this wasn\'t about Ryouko he hardly hesitated to grant the favor. \"I didn\'t really question it at the time. I had much bigger problems.\"

\"Understandably.\"

\"But she looked like she was trying to help,\" Kuma said, bearing the mind‐read uncomfortably. \"She honestly saved my life. She\'s not in any trouble, is she?\"

\"Well, just between you and me, she\'s supposed to be dead,\" Asaka said, smiling slightly. \"That\'s why you couldn\'t identify her. There\'s a faction that has been causing all these incidents.\"

She turned, gesturing at the wall where Kuma\'s news program was still frozen.

\"But it doesn\'t make sense for her to be a part of that,\" she finished, as she withdrew from his mind. \"And thanks.\"

\"Do you know anything about what\'s going on?\" Kuma asked. \"Are you allowed to share anything?\"

\"Yes,\" Asaka said, with a brief pause that amplified all his worries.

\"I\'m supposed to tell you,\" Asaka continued, \"that the cloning program is about to get *very* public. There have been uncontrollable infodumps online---there\'s also footage of all the clone bodies in the ruins of the church above us---and Governance has decided it\'s no longer possible to keep this secret. This is not going to be comfortable for you.\"

She leaned forward as she spoke, instinctively lowering her voice, even though they both knew the room was secure.

Kuma closed his eyes. Again, he had been spared the worst‐case news. Not that this wasn\'t disastrous. If it weren\'t for implant restrictions on violence, he might very well be assaulted on the street for his role in human cloning.

Could he even rely on those restrictions, given what had happened today?

\"That\'s not even the half of it,\" Asaka said, voice grave, and Kuma felt another ripple of fear.

She clasped her hands in front of her.

\"Let\'s just get it out of the way,\" she said quickly. \"What Joanne Valentin did, the modifications that were made to your daughter, your initial agreement---all of that has been leaked to the public. Now, to be clear, there\'s a been a lot of false leaks too, and we\'ll be denying this one---but *some* people are going to believe it.\"

Kuma stared blankly for a few seconds, before slowly putting his hands to his head.

\"I---I would have you know I consider that one of my greatest mistakes,\" Kuma said. \"She tricked us, you know. And now I have to live wondering just what she was up to.\"

\"You don\'t have to explain yourself to me,\" Asaka said.

There was a long pause, enough time for Kuma to stare at his hands and wonder if Governance had some kind of program to train him in how to convincingly lie to his colleagues.

\"There is something else,\" Asaka said. \"I\'ve been saving it for last.\"

Kuma groaned.

\"There is a reason I wanted to stress the Church\'s role in evacuating Prometheus. I want you to know that the Goddess is real. I\'ve even spoken to her, and to the dead. There *is* an afterlife waiting for us.\"

There was only one reason Asaka would bring up a topic like that, Kuma knew. After all, why else would Asaka specifically have been sent to him?

But he felt his mind sliding around the edges of the obvious inference, trying to think of some reason, *any reason*, he was wrong.

He couldn\'t.

\"She\'s dead, isn\'t she?\" he asked, without looking up.

\"Almost certainly,\" Asaka said. \"Technically, she\'s missing in action, but you shouldn\'t hold out hope.\"

He put one hand on the railing of his bed.

\"How did it happen?\" he asked, voice quiet, staring at that hand.

\"About as heroically as one could hope for,\" Asaka said. \"Personally salvaging a huge military operation at great personal risk, just like at Orpheus. The mission used an interstellar wormhole, but it was destroyed while she was using it to return. We looked everywhere around our end, but it was a forlorn hope. It\'s not possible for her to have survived on the other end.\"

There was a brief pause, and when he didn\'t say anything Asaka continued:

\"Her sacrifice may have had a decisive effect on the course of the war. She will be honored accordingly---the mission will be public knowledge soon, with the ongoing Directorate press conference. We won\'t let her name be slandered.\"

There was much to interrogate about what Asaka had said, starting with the wormhole, but Kuma didn\'t really care for those details at the moment, and Asaka clearly understood that.

He held himself still for a moment, then lashed his hand outward, slamming it into the vase next to his bed, which flew into the wall and landed with a thud, spilling water onto the floor. Not quite enough to trigger the violence implants, it seemed.

\"This is *exactly* why I agreed to Valentin\'s offer in the first place,\" he said, growling into Asaka\'s face. \"So this *wouldn\'t happen! And she betrayed me! If I ever meet her, she better be goddamn careful. Not many people know how to disable their implant restrictions.\"

It was nonsense, of course. By all indications, Valentin was a magical girl, which meant that he had essentially no chance at hands‐on revenge. Nor was this *exactly* what he had feared for Ryouko---an infuriatingly rational part of him was proud for all that she had accomplished, in the life she had chosen.

He held his seated position for what seemed like an eternity, arm clenched, then flopped back onto his bed, listless.

\"Does Nakase‐chan know yet?\" he asked.

\"I don\'t know,\" Asaka said.

Then, tilting her head: \"No, not yet. She\'s refusing to meet with the person they sent.\"

\"I\'ll do it now then,\" Kuma said. \"And no offense, get out of my room.\"

Asaka let out a breath.

\"Right. I imagine they\'ll send the grievance counselor in a bit. But thanks for speaking with me.\"

Then she left him alone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asami hadn\'t known it was possible to feel so *bad.* Not under a full blanket of emotional suppression.

She had held out a brief, desperate hope that Ryouko had survived on their end of the wormhole, even after she had lost sight of her within.

But she understood better than anyone how the wormhole collapse had evolved, had used her powers to corral every exit in Human space. Thanks to her efforts, they had located every missing member of their squad within minutes, floating in the void at most a few hundred kilometers away.

All except Ryouko.

Now she found herself staring at her stump of a wrist, sheathed in a metal healing device, awaiting a clonal hand transplant, cheaper than a healer\'s magic.

She couldn\'t bring herself to care. The emotional suppression kept the despair, the pain, the regret all at bay, but it couldn\'t control the apathy*, couldn\'t create a positive motivation for her to do anything.

All she wanted was to sink into Ryouko\'s arms, to feel her breathe, to tell her she loved her again.

But that wasn\'t possible now. Not anymore.

\"If this is some kind of waiting contest, you\'re not going to win,\" Asami said, without looking up at the woman standing in her doorway. "You might as well give up and walk away.\"

\"I got you to say something, didn\'t I?\" Clarisse van Rossum said. "But I\'m not here to be your psychiatrist; I\'m here with divine guidance.\"

She didn\'t care to hear it. The Goddess had asked her to stay with Ryouko, to protect her, and she had failed to do so. What more could be wanted of her now?

Maybe she had doomed humanity, getting Ryouko killed with her ill‐conceived plan. There was an intriguing thought. She could dwell on that for a while.

Well, no, she supposed she couldn\'t do that, not with Van Rossum probing at her like this.

\"Why would I want to hear from *her*? Neither of us was able to keep Ryouko alive, and that\'s all there is to it. What, is she going to offer me consolations? I have plenty of those.\"

\"No, it\'s not just that,\" Van Rossum said. \"Look, I know how you feel, but I think you\'ll want to hear this regardless. It\'s about Ryouko, and it\'s not just platitudes.\"

Asami lay there for a long moment, wondering what it would be like to tell Van Rossum to leave her alone.

Begrudgingly, Asami sat up, dropping her feet off the side of her bed.

\"Well? I\'m listening,\" she said, still hugging Ryouko\'s pillow.

\"It\'s not something I can just say,\" Van Rossum said. \"It\'s something I have to show you. Come on, get dressed. I\'ll wait outside. I promise you it\'s worth it.\"

Asami thought about it as she dressed, dialing her emotional suppression down a notch. What could possibly be worth all this? The last thing she wanted to hear right now was some explanation about how Ryouko\'s death had been very important in the grand scheme of things. But she had to think Van Rossum knew that.

She spotted the pair of CubeBots on her shelf, one of them coming alive to greet her, and felt a well of pain rise up within her. She didn\'t suppress it, not this time. Instead, she let it wash through her, threatening to pull her down into the abyss.

It felt right, somehow.

The CubeBot chirped, lifting its back to offer an assortment of grief cubes.

\"Thanks,\" she murmured, grabbing a few. Then a few more.

She chose as nondescript an outfit as she could manage, then stepped outside, letting Van Rossum lead her through the station, out of the residential areas, past the labs, into an intra‐station transport, into the medical area---

\"Wait, no,\" Asami said finally, stopping in the hallway. \"Why the hell are you taking me here? I am *not* talking to her. Why would you want me to talk to her? I wouldn\'t feel safe having the two of us in the same room.\"

She meant, of course, Simona del Mago, whose soul gem signature she had grown all too familiar with, and which pulsed quite obviously from the holding cell a few slots over. She had not forgotten that if Simona had just *cooperated*, then it would have been easier for Asami and Ryouko to do their work, and then maybe, just maybe, none of this would have---

\"I know,\" Van Rossum said, grabbing her by the shoulder. \"These feelings are natural. On my own judgment, I wouldn\'t think opposite sides of the station are far *enough* for you two right now. But I have it on quite good authority that you two should meet, because she has a message for you.\"

Asami closed her eyes, then let out a breath, indicating Van Rossum should lead the way.

\"Fine. You can probably keep me from killing her. But if I had known this would be so much trouble, I would have stayed in bed,\" Asami said, and meant it.

They found Simona reclining in a chair, watching a news projection on the wall. She still had her soul gem, which was more trust than Asami would have given her.

They made a decent show of ignoring each other for a few seconds, before Simona turned off the projection.

\"I heard about what happened,\" she began.

\"And you\'re just sitting there like everything is fine,\" Asami spat. "When this is basically your fault.\"

\"It *is* my fault,\" Simona said, fingers digging into her armrests. "I failed to protect her. But she\'s not dead. My wish is unfulfilled.\"

\"Not dead?\" Asami echoed, raising her voice, a point of anger breaking through her weakened suppression. \"You weren\'t there! If she\'s not dead, then she\'s lost in space and soon will be!\"

\"But my wish is unfulfilled,\" Simona said, as if echoing a mantra, hands still gripping her chair. \"I can\'t tell you how it\'s possible, but she *doesn\'t* understand me---*can\'t* understand me, until I get through to her---and until that happens, my wish is unfulfilled.\"

\"Normally, I wouldn\'t put much stock in it either,\" Van Rossum said, turning to address Asami. \"There\'s a wide body of literature on allegedly unfulfilled wishes. It\'s always a misunderstanding. I\'ve seen a few myself.\"

She shook her head.

\"But I got a message just as the wormhole collapsed, from our divine friend. It said to talk to Simona del Mago, and to Nakihara Asami, and to bring them together. So here I am. And Simona is convinced Ryouko is alive.\"

\"I would like a personal word with your Goddess if she isn\'t,\" Simona said. Her chair had manifested three additional support struts for each armrest.

\"I\'m afraid I only ever hear from her just before, or during, historic moments,\" Van Rossum said. \"And that\'s a secret, by the by.\"

\"Not surprising,\" Simona said.

Asami stewed silently. She wasn\'t going to believe that Ryouko was alive. Not for a reason as stupid as this. To start with, she wasn\'t at all convinced Van Rossum had really heard from the Goddess. More likely, this was some ridiculous attempt at manipulating her---\"for her benefit\", of course. She couldn\'t find the energy to figure out the real angle, but there probably was one.

But despite what she told herself, the claim had ignited a glimmer of hope, and she began to fear having that hope dashed.

\"That\'s it then?\" Asami said, gesturing at Simona with one hand. "I\'m supposed to listen to a crazy girl? Why can\'t the Goddess just say* things?\"

\"You know the answer to that,\" Van Rossum said. \"I don\'t think you\'re *supposed* to know what to do right now, but I can suggest an option: you can just go ask.\"

\"Go ask,\" Asami repeated. \"You mean on Earth, at the Ribbon.\"

\"Yes.\"

Asami looked down at the floor. Her feelings on Simona aside, it was a sensible enough idea. She had the opportunity---Project Armstrong would need a long time to regroup without Ryouko. Ryouko\'s funeral would probably be in Mitakihara, and she\'d have bereavement leave, come to think of it. And the Ribbon meant a chance to see Ryouko either way, dead *or* alive. Maybe even Clarisse.

That was a nice thought, in a way. She supposed she should thank her emotional suppression for letting her make such an objective assessment.

Simona and Van Rossum seemed to be discussing whether it would be possible to visit the Ribbon right now, for some reason, but Asami decided to keep tuning them out.

If Ryouko *were* alive---no, no, she could *not* start thinking like that. She was being pushed to visit the Ribbon, thanks to Simona and Van Rossum, but she couldn\'t set herself up for an entire second round of heartbreak. Not when she didn\'t even know how she would survive this one.

But she couldn\'t hide from the Ribbon now, either. Ryouko deserved better. All Asami was in for was a bit of pain. She could suffer that much in payment.

She gritted her teeth.

\"Alright,\" she said. \"Fine. But don\'t expect me to spend any more time with *her.* I want to spend my time alone.\"

\"Hold on,\" Simona said, standing up abruptly as Asami turned to leave.

\"What?\" Asami asked, making sure sufficient venom leaked into her voice.

\"She\'s alive. I don\'t know if this Ribbon will convince you of that, but if it does, we\'ll be the only two people willing to risk everything to get her back. We need to work together. We shouldn\'t let jealousy get in the way of that.\"

Asami felt the pit of anger in her stomach boil over, searing its way through her restraints.

\"Jealousy? Yeah, I\'m *jealous* you got her killed, you bitch! Don\'t you have a fucking court‐martial to be at?\"

Then she stormed out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Elsewhere, earlier.* 

A wave of nausea hit Ryouko as the alien ship finished its blink.

She felt her body struggling, kept functioning only by a copious dose of magic. She wanted to drop to her knees and let the fugue take hold, but... not now.

*Whatever happens, we\'ll keep control of our own fate,* Clarisse thought, echoing her own sentiment.

Ryouko looked around the room. In most respects, it was like every other alien storage room she had seen that day: rounded corners and entryways, sand‐textured floors, maintenance drones that derived from a different, inhuman* aesthetic, wriggling along the floors as they worked.

In other ways, it was different. The walls had the subtle lustre of holographic metamaterial, similar to human ships. A large circle in the center of the ceiling filled the room with a pale light that resembled filtered sunlight.

But what drew her eye, what instantly caught her attention, was the obvious *text*, the labels affixed to the crates on the floor, the symbols above the doorway, the large blocks displayed on the nearest wall. Unreadable, but unmistakable.

*A four‐part symbology,* Clarisse thought. *With obvious patterns. If fewer of my processing cores were critically damaged, I\'d start language analysis.*

The wall beside her began to change, the symbols disappearing, replaced by a pair of alien individuals. It took her a moment to realize that it was a video feed.

These Squid looked different, too.

The two peered at her, bodies buried in what looked like layers of robes, sealed at the edges with metallic‐looking rings. The eyes were larger than she was used to, and the necks a bit shorter.

One of them raised an arm, seeming to point at her with one tentacle‐like finger.

A wave of telepathy flowed into her, a stream of concepts and images, and maybe even speech. Calm, beneficence, wanting to meet.

Then the noise seemed to lessen, her mind finally able to grasp at a narrative.

*I think I can see some patterns now,* Clarisse thought. *This is a simpler signal than before, and much of the noise is just too many signals at once. It makes sense---we know they have a less‐centralized nervous system.*

Now Ryouko could finally make out some of what was being projected. In her mind\'s eye she saw images of broken alien limbs, ichor, and what she recognized as alien medical equipment. Then, a diagram of a path through the ship labeled with that equipment.

*They\'re offering medical care,* Ryouko thought. *Do we dare take it?*

*In for a penny, in for a pound,* Clarisse thought. *We\'re already here.*

Ryouko was already moving towards the door, since she could work out the logic too.

Then her legs crumpled beneath her, pain ricocheting through her midbody, and she fell to one knee, using magic to stabilize herself. Perhaps *walking* was not the best idea.

She sent back a message to the source of telepathy, indicating her intent to teleport, not knowing if they understood.

She waited for a response, any response, and when she got something vaguely affirmative she made the jump.

The medical ward she appeared in looked not radically different from the ones she was familiar with: large machines with mysterious tubes, vial after vial of nanite gels arrayed inside an autodispenser, a small army of support drones pouring out of a port in the wall.

And two reclining medical beds, one somewhat smaller than the other. Were there aliens that small?

\"Hello,\" something said, in the voice of a human female.

The clear, understandable greeting almost made her jump, and she spent a moment looking for its source, before realizing it was coming from an alien* standing in one of the doorways; she couldn\'t tell if it had been one of those in the video earlier.

She realized that the \"Hello\" was prerecorded, though, and the telepathy that followed was not as clear, but she still understood: she looked seriously injured, and further activity was only causing more damage.

Then it sent an image of just what she looked like.

It was something she had avoided thinking about, and for good reason: open wounds, gaping sores, and peeling skin testified to combat injuries and lethal‐if‐untreated levels of radiation damage. In a way, it was misleading: Clarisse\'s influence and her own trained instinct had focused magical and mundane healing on core systems, not superficialities. But there was nothing inaccurate about the fact that she looked like death.

Some actual medical care would carry real benefits, like allowing her to save grief cubes until she got back. Even if that seemed a bit ridiculous to plan for.

But it still took a real leap of faith, a swallowing of fear, to put herself on the smaller of the two medical beds, and stare up at the surgical apparatus above.

She watched nervously as the alien stood at the wall, receiving a series of cloudy nanite tubes into its finger‐tentacles.

*We\'re* sure *that magical girls are immune to nanite hacking?* Ryouko thought.

*Yes,* Clarisse thought, though her tone suggested she was shaky as well. *Though I\'d have no idea whether they can accurately manipulate human physiology. Either way, you might want to pay close attention to anything that\'s going on.*

There was another pulse of telepathy from the alien, but this time she couldn\'t parse it. An image of small molecular assemblies---nanites, perhaps?---and some confused imagery that followed.

But the gesture was clear enough, especially when the robotic arms above unwound themselves---smooth‐jointed and multi‐limbed, just like the human equivalent, though the motions were more uncanny, and it was clear just whose limbs they were meant to resemble.

It took a force of will not to jerk backward as the device went to work, applying patches of wound sealant and skin‐replacement, the chemicals alternately warm and clammy where they touched her, the pain fading quickly underneath.

*It\'s just like the last time you took a radiation burst,* Clarisse thought, referring to the fight outside *HSS Pierre‐Simon Laplace*, a lifetime ago. *I can\'t detect anything unusual entering your system. These seem like purely synthetic skin grafts, though.*

Then the alien held out one of its tubes, inserting it into a small, ball‐shaped handheld device right in front of her face. It was clearly trying to make sure she saw.

*Nanite injector, I assume,* Clarisse thought, even as the device came closer to Ryouko\'s arm.

This time, Ryouko even jerked away slightly, before managing to convince herself by the old trick of simply looking away.

*I can\'t monitor everything being done,* Clarisse thought, once the nanite tubes were all expended. *But I\'m monitoring cellular repair, energy delivery, and nutrient support. No attempts at hacking, and you haven\'t noticed anything with your magic, right?*

*No,* Ryouko thought.

The robotic arms withdrew, leaving her and the alien... doctor staring at each other. Their eyes met, sending a chill down her spine. Cephalopod eyes were notoriously human‐like, with their visible sclera, even if these eyes weren\'t quite what she was used to from the battlefield.

*`∪·Hello|+·More meaningfully this time|∪·Greetings`* the alien thought.

\"What the hell?\" Ryouko said, jumping backwards on her bed, repaired skin scraping against the polymer surface.

The thought had been crystal‐clear this time. Or perhaps it was more correct to say *thoughts*, layered atop one another. Somehow she knew that, and understood it cleanly besides. The first and third thoughts were meant to be understood together, and the second thought as an addition to them.

` `*`·We took the opportunity to complete the organ inside your head, enabling communication|+·Your species' biotechnology ≈ an unfinished story|∈·We will not modify you further without informed consent|∈·This act was the output of a binding‐preference‐alteration‐agreement`*` `

It shouldn\'t have been possible, but Ryouko understood instantly---or at least, she understood the component concepts instantly. It was clear that \"binding‐preference‐alteration‐agreement\" referred to an idea she was unfamiliar with.

Still, that wasn\'t the first question on her mind.

*It was a* communications *implant this whole time?* Ryouko thought, attempting to reply on the same... channel the alien was using. *How and why would anyone do that?*

` `*`μ·Not only a communications organ, but also a preference‐specification organ|ν∈·Akemi‐Homura⊃Divine‐seeking performed prenatal surgery upon you|μ+·The preference‐specification functionality was likewise incomplete until now|ν∈·We did not fully understand, but in part, to enable further Human‐Thinker cooperation|ν+·The binding‐preference‐alteration‐agreement was negotiated with her`*` `

Ryouko sank back in her bed, taking in the stream of revelations as best she could. This day, by far the longest day of her life, just simply would not *stop*. Was she a nervous wreck yet? Hopefully not.

*Don\'t forget to take all of this with a bit of skepticism,* Clarisse thought. *Though, since Yuma* did *tell us that Akemi Homura was responsible for your brain modifications, that much is likely true.*

And she had edited her brain to... communicate with the Cephalopods? Were there not simpler ways to achieve the same goal, that didn\'t require fifteen years of waiting? There had to be something else going on.

There was something important she didn\'t understand.

*Preference‐specification?* she asked, using not the Standard words but the mental concept she had been sent. *What does* that *mean?*

` `*`∪·Utility‐preference, perhaps|∪·Fundamental expressions for the prioritization of different imperatives|∪·Morals, values, desires`*` `

Ryouko felt abruptly as if someone were watching her. No, that wasn\'t quite right---she felt no urge to look behind her. It was more like... someone was inspecting her, staring at her.

` `*`·Finally, through you, we can empathize‐open the preference‐specification for your species|∈·What I find here is bizarre|∈!·Such flexibility, and indeterminacy, and happenchance`*` `

Ryouko did not understand. The telepathic interface was clearly doing a lot* to translate unfamiliar concepts back and forth, but the information was compiling in unfamiliar ways within her mind.

She said as much.

*`μ·Perhaps‒83% it will be instructive for you to empathize‐open my preference‐specification|ν?·Would you like some time alone to learn about our society and technology|ν+·Your specification suggests you would`{.calibre the alien thought.

Ryouko didn\'t find the simultaneous topics as disorienting as she might have---she had some experience, dealing with older magical girls---but she could tell she was responding unnaturally. The alien\'s telepathic channel allowed for multiple connection threads; Clarisse suggested that the intent was she respond on each as she generated responses, in a simultaneous, continuous back‐and‐forth, rather than letting the connections lapse and waiting until she could dump her entire response along a new, single thread.

Processing it all was taxing, and she was already spending magic just staving off complete exhaustion. She needed to *rest*, not learn a new mode of communication.

But she had no choice but to *understand* more.

*I\'d love to do some learning later, once I\'ve had a break. But before that, how do I empathize‐open?*

` `*`+·Go on|∈·It should be natural now|∈·Simply try to make the request of me`*` `

To say that the instructions were unclear was underselling it, but Ryouko guessed at what she was supposed to do; perhaps it was like learning to use new thought‐based technology, something everyone had been trained to do as children. All you needed to do was think it hard enough.

And just like that, the problem cracked open, a rivulet of information pouring into the cup of her mind.

She suddenly felt like she *understood* the alien. That she could profess its beliefs, predict its behavior, understand its values. *That understanding seemed to erupt through her consciousness, a flower of knowledge that peaked in revelation.

And the alien\'s name was 9Qta3Ba⊃Peace‐cultivating.

\"Peace‐cultivating\" waited a very long moment before explaining:

` `*`·This ability is the foundation of our civilization|+∈·One Consensus, many Tentacles; one core preference‐specification, many branching extensions from it|+∈·Empathy‐opening cannot be refused, and is required regularly, so we can model each others' behavior—thus, our Consensus is preserved`*` `

Again, a long pause. Clarisse suggested that the alien might be waiting for Ryouko\'s acknowledgment, unable to read her body language.

It took a moment for Ryouko to give it. Her magic and implants were keeping her awake and aware, but her willpower was eroded. She was tired*.

` `*`·The original, uncommunicative versions of this organ were purely biological|·It is fascinating that, without an equivalent, your society is not tearing itself apart|·You should consider a choice of star‐name for yourself, the process may‒32% help you rationalize your preference‐specification`*` `

*This is all well and good, and I\'m happy to absorb as much enemy intel as I can hold,* Clarisse thought. *But we really have bigger problems to tackle. Like, why are they attacking us? And where are they taking us?*

*·With all due respect, why is your species attacking us? What reason do you have to attack us?\|·Where are you taking us? Why am I here?*

Ryouko, torn between asking the two questions, found herself asking both at once. The process wasn\'t *quite* natural---she hadn\'t reused the existing telepathic threads, but rather created two new ones, and Ryouko felt her head threatening to split besides---but still, it happened.

` `*`μν·Those two topics ≈ two views of the same mountain|μ·Attempts at communicating with your civilization reportedly failed, so Consensus allocated resources to Consensus/Thinker‐preserving for the suppression of your reality‐distortion technology|ν∈·Not long after the initial intervention, Akemi Homura⊃Divine‐seeking came in contact with us, Consensus/Ahimsa‐extending—her ability to communicate was limited, but she carried a written document claiming that Consensus/Thinker‐preserving was compromised, and that their violence was founded on false premises|ν∈·Divine‐seeking gave detailed instructions on where and when to wait for you, and requested technology necessary to produce you|ξ?·We were not informed of the entity "Clarisse" we see in your preference‐specification—a symbiotic individual stored on your spine`*` `

Ryouko\'s head throbbed. What she was being told raised more questions than answers, even the parts that verified everything she had ever suspected about her life. *And* they still hadn\'t told her where they were taking her.

She strained herself to produce responses on the appropriate connections. She just needed to keep going a little longer.

*\|μ·What do you mean, reality‐distortion technology? We are researching no such thing. That\'s not an explanation.\|ν·Akemi Homura* talked *to you? And set up all that? Why? It doesn\'t make sense.\|\|ξ·Clarisse is a... support AI that was implanted recently in me by Homura. It was part of an experimental program which was not supposed to produce AIs, but it\'s possible Homura modified it. I do not know.*

She was instinctively wary of being so truthful about Clarisse, but decided she shouldn\'t hold back. Not when she had a chance to get answers.

Besides, if her modeling of the alien\'s behavior was accurate, it was supposedly* very interested in maintaining peace between sentients, and would not lie about the cause of a war... at least not in this situation.

Peace‐cultivating\'s eyes slid to the side, in a gesture Ryouko was tempted to read as hesitant, and some of its responses were delayed after the others.

` `*`|μ·You are a living example of this technology|v·Divine‐seeking pointed out the importance of communication for proving her assertions, and we agreed, but why she chose this method, we do not know—we accepted her offer as a token of good faith||ξ·Concerning, but if Clarisse⊃??? was instantiated accidentally then it is understandable—your species should work on providing them a new platform|μ+∪·A technology which is outside the grasp of our science|μ+∪·A technology too dangerous to use|μ·We attempted to warn your civilization of the risk, and deployed a fleet with combat‐bodies when that failed`*` `

Ryouko\'s headache got worse, but Clarisse provided some neuromodulator support so she could keep thinking.

*Living example of...* she thought, to herself.

Did they mean *magic*?

*Do* not *explain that to them,* Clarisse thought. *Not yet at least. Think about how they might react to learning about the Incubators, or that we don\'t control our own magic sources. It\'s a huge strategic insight we shouldn\'t be giving away.*

*That\'s a good point,* Ryouko thought, a bit peeved that Clarisse hadn\'t even given her a chance to think of that on her own.

Though, considering the state she was in...

*I did not realize that is what you meant,* Ryouko thought, retreating back into single‐threaded thought. *The truth is that our government either did not receive or did not understand any such queries before your, uh, combat‐bodies arrived. And by combat‐bodies do you mean your soldiers?*

She knew shallowly the video from the asteroid Yuma had visited, since it had been part of the information Yuma had sent her, but she was also pretty sure* she shouldn\'t admit to the alien that their messages probably hadn\'t been received because Governance had been compromised.

At least not yet, as Clarisse had said.

Similarly, she avoided addressing the other topics. So many threads to pull at, many all‐too‐dangerous.

` `*`∪·Combat‐bodies include all the physical forms Thinkers use to exert military force, not only those with shapes approximating evolutionary Baseline|∪·I refer to Thinker consciousnesses inhabiting battleready forms, with full backup|👁+?·Am I to understand that your combat‐bodies are not the same`*` `

*That* question came with a telepathic header that Ryouko was experiencing for the first time, signifying a... high‐priority‐on‐transparency question.

In other words, the alien knew she was hiding information, and very much desired honesty on at least this point.

And no wonder, Ryouko realized, recalling Peace‐cultivating\'s preference‐specification.

*They are not,* Ryouko thought. *Only our AIs have backups. Our non‐biological forces. They\'re very different from anyone who shares my body plan. Don\'t tell me you\'ve been assuming we all have backups?*

A pale horror crept into her gut, a dawning realization of just what a cosmic joke *that* would be. How could they not have realized? That kind of mistake simply wasn\'t possible, not for *two decades*---Human behavior and tactics in the war should have made the truth obvious within *days*.

` `*`∈·The Tentacles applying force verified to us that you did, and later presented evidence of combat bodies like yours repeatedly returning to battle with the same unique reality‐distortions|∈·Akemi Homura⊃Divine‐seeking claimed you did not, and that the truth was being hidden from us by reality‐distortion, but provided limited evidence`*` `

Peace‐cultivating raised an arm‐tentacle at the wall, which turned black, bathing the world into an eerie darkness, the medical bay seeming to drop out of view, replaced by a breathtaking immersion of stars, a holographic feat humans saved only for movie theatres.

Upon examination, it was clear this was a location still near the pulsar. But then the scene shifted, suddenly jumping, each time closer and closer to the galactic core, the stars growing denser and brighter.

A flash of Sagittarius A☆, the Milky Way\'s supermassive black hole, then a rapid sequence of extra‐galactic scenes, all centered on the broadening image of a spiral galaxy so big and so close it could only be Andromeda, until abruptly they were inside it, in the core---

---and then they were outside it again, Andromeda\'s disk retreating, and they rotated so that a new spiral galaxy came marching into view.

Then they stopped, with the stream of its stars enveloping the room.

*`μ∈·You asked why you are here|ν∈·You asked where we were going|ν∈·Our home systems, in a galaxy separate from yours|μ∈·You must speak to the Consensus`{.calibre Peace‐cultivating thought.

*The Triangulum Galaxy,* Ryouko thought.

#### Appendix: \"Understanding Thinker‐Human Translations\" 

> \[...\]
>
> As such, SAH humanization sacrifices a large measure of readability to more accurately convey the parallel, simultaneous nature of Thinker telepathy. Paragraph structures are radically repurposed towards this end: paragraphs are built not from a sequence of complete sentences on a topic, but rather from the set of messages sent concurrently along the threads of a telepathic channel. These messages are separated only by \"\|\" tokens within each paragraph, and only one message per thread is allowed in a single paragraph. Therefore, a paragraph break is made whenever a new message is sent on a previously‐used thread, whether from the original sender or not.
>
> Messages in SAH humanization also differ from sentences in Standard in several respects. Most prominent is the addition of a header, denoted by a trailing \"·\", which conveys metadata about the information being sent in a given message. Typically, this metadata is represented by a sequence of individual symbols^1^---for example, lowercase Greek letters are used to identify messages on different threads as pertaining to a particular topic under discussion.^2^ Less obvious differences include the omission of end punctuation and the tendency toward \"run‐on\" messages, which reflect the continuous and readily‐interrupted flavor of Thinker telepathy.^3^ Last is the inclusion of various brachygraphic symbols, which will be discussed in more depth later.
>
> Consider the following text, which is adapted from a Thinker telepathic multithreaded stream using SAH humanization:^4^

>
> This represents a two‐thread communication along a single telepathic channel, where the first thread\'s message begins with the header "μ·\" and where the second thread\'s message begins with the header "ν·\". These headers indicate that there are two separate topics being discussed simultaneously.

> In displayed format, a code‐like typeface (such as Type‐Standard Molluscan*) is used to distinguish standard Thinker telepathy, representing the lack of emotional affect. It is natural for Human readers to interpret emotional undertones into any written text, even those from Thinkers. It is hoped that an alternate typeface emphasizes what any Human receiving Thinker telepathy feels instinctively: that such undertones are not at all present.

> In this second paragraph, the multithreaded telepathy switches from using two threads to three. The first two threads in this example continue on their original \"μ\" and \"ν\" topics, but this is not a certainty---sometimes topics will shift threads. The third thread\'s message begins with the header \"μ+·\". The first symbol in the header establishes the topic, and the second symbol means that, for full understanding, a message on another thread with the same topic must also be understood---in this case, the \"μ·\" message on the first thread, though a \"+\" symbol can be used without a topic symbol like "μ\" if there is only a single topic under discussion.
>
> It is important to understand here that paragraph groupings do not indicate exact simultaneity of messages. Typically, messages with a "+\" symbol in their header begin sending somewhat later than others, though much of their transmission duration will still be in parallel with the message or messages on which they depend.

> For this next snippet, in which we have skipped ahead a bit in the source material, watch for a new symbol in the headers:

## Aftershocks 

> On the back of this provisional communications infrastructure grew the sprouts of a unique internal culture, and what would one day be a true sociological wonder: a sealed internal cultural and media ecosystem, encompassing enough to replace the mundane world entirely for many members.
>
> But the beginnings were humble. The network was at first used only for Charter compliance reporting: securely documented grief cube contributions to the Pool and financial contributions to the Fund, team wellness reports, and other official matters. It was several years before extensive use developed in the opposite direction---in the form of General Meeting announcements, recordings, and minutes---and several more years before the introduction of horizontal channels.
>
> Mundane commercial products had always provided the means of day‐to‐day communication within the MSY, despite longstanding Incubator complaints, but increasing automoderation and security issues made the need for a replacement quite obvious. Initial initiatives provided the basics of a more secure magical framework: peer‐to‐peer messaging, chatrooms, and an MSY‐wide forum, with the latter\'s history imported from its commercial predecessor.
>
> Soon after, enterprising organization members began initiatives of their own. This included several social media copycats, to varying degrees of success, along with attempts at everything from newsletters to dating services.
>
> The MSY was initially content to allow the system to grow as it would, providing funding and support for security and infrastructure, but little else. That changed within decades, as the first media personalities emerged and proved themselves supremely adept at manipulating public opinion and belief, most notably Chiyo Rika, whose biweekly opinion videos became essential viewing for politicos.
>
> The final impetus for regulation came with the MSY\'s suppression of the Japanese Yakuza syndicates. While nominally a planned, deliberate action with the legitimate support of the Leadership Committee, the tidal wave of public opinion that surged out of a few key incidents gave them almost no choice, nearly triggering a crisis. In particular, the Nagoya Crimes---in which the family of a popular team lead was murdered, followed by her bloody reprisals and the MSY\'s attempts to contain the fallout---led to waves of outrage about both real and false abuses by both the MSY and Yakuza.
>
> Afterward, amidst concerns about misinformation and panic, the MSY made its first attempts to perform stewardship on its own media.
>
> They found the task challenging. Not only were most of the existing commentators and online communities steadfastly resistant to outside manipulation or monitoring, but the system as a whole was heavily decentralized, with federated groups maintaining locally‐encrypted comms, resistant to even magical penetration, based on techniques and technologies the leadership itself had produced and rolled out.
>
> Instead, the leadership was forced to proceed much more cooperatively, bringing prominent opinion‐makers into the fold with promises of access and both technical and financial support. With the Charter Rewrite of 2059 and the investiture of legislative power in the newly‐formed Rules Committee, many of these favored media leaders soon won political office as well, further increasing their media clout. Chiyo Rika, in particular, quickly rose to become Speaker of the Rules Committee.
>
> This rather incestuous relationship between MSY officialdom and media would become a staple of the pre‐Unification Wars era. Legally speaking, the MSY\'s culture and media organizations were largely free from direct interference, but in practice everything from the social media nonprofits to the movie studios were run by MSY leadership---not by conspiracy, not exactly, but rather through a natural consolidation of power and a shared cultural consensus.
>
> There things would mostly stay, until the advent of the Unification Wars.
>
> With the benefit of hindsight, conventional wisdom pegs the MSY media as an unwitting accomplice of the radicals of the Mages First movement, and of the budding Freedom Alliance more generally. Media elites, beholden to the political status quo, projected their own complacency to the public, downplaying the tensions growing within the MSY, and suppressing extremist rhetoric from the alleged fringes. Further, alarmed by the waves of AI‐powered public manipulation emanating from the mundane world, they attempted to isolate the MSY public---and themselves---in a protected bubble. To a degree, this worked---but not everyone was listening.
>
> The radical political violence of the St. Petersburg Atrocity, and the legitimate popular support it garnered among a minority of ordinary magical girls, thus came as a brutal shock to the MSY and to its media organs. The MSY could not unite in pursuit of peace, as its leaders had hoped---the ferocity with which the majority\'s stifled interventionist sentiment erupted proved that. Decades of cultural management collapsed overnight as raw public emotion overrode everything. In an irregular full membership meeting, multiple Charter amendments were passed via direct referendum, plunging the MSY---and the world---into war.
>
> The wartime pattern that ensued would be familiar to most students of history. Media policy shifted to an unapologetic pro‐war stance, with the rapidly centralizing and expanding MSY bureaucracy exerting substantially expanded control over the media. Freedoms of press and speech were significantly curtailed in the name of victory and the elimination of Freedom Alliance influence, though notably to a lesser extent than in mundane society.
>
> But the eventual end of the wars brought a real surprise: chafing at wartime restrictions and angry at the failures of the prewar political apparatus, the postwar Rules Committee drove a paradigm‐shifting wave of media liberalization, independence, and decentralization. Perhaps the most consequential change was an outright ban on media employment and ownership for all government officials, both elected and appointed, which has held all the way to the present day. Coming as it did at the end of a long period of media subservience to political power, most established media players chose their offices over their megaphones, opening up the media landscape to a brand‐new generation of personalities and institutions.
>
> Of course, there is one story that must always accompany any account of the \"Revolution in Media\". Throughout this period Chiyo Rika, Speaker of the Rules Committee once again, consistently championed every piece of media reform legislation, leveraging her own media empire into an effort that eroded her own power. By the time the dual‐role ban came up for debate, she controlled just one company, holding nothing but the rights to the past two centuries of her biweekly opinion videos. When that measure finally passed, she stood up upon the dais of the Rules Committee plenary chamber, and announced her immediate resignation---not from her company but from the speakership itself.

> Any discussion of Thinker society or concepts quickly finds itself endlessly restating a number of Thinker cultural terms. While this is not a problem in telepathic communication of any sort, it quickly becomes burdensome in spoken or written Standard. Abbreviations and acronyms are sometimes used to alleviate that burden; for example:

For this, SAH follows the classic approach of writing the full phrase whenever it is first used, followed by the abbreviation in parenthesis. Subsequent usages may use only the abbreviation.

> ^1^ The description of the set of values, needs, and preferences of a Thinker or group of Thinkers, sufficient to model their satisfaction in response to outcomes, and to predict their behavior. All Thinkers provide their pref‐specs freely to empathize‐open requests; indeed, the fundamental laws of the Consensus require Thinkers to be biologically unable to refuse.
>
> ^2^ The Thinker process of using the pref‐spec of another Thinker or group of Thinkers to predict their current and future behavior, particularly in the context of unknown or secret information. Routinely computed within the empathy‐organs of individual Thinkers, but accurate prediction for more than a few individuals requires the support of computing clusters.
>
> ^3^ The practice of arbitrage between Thinker Tentacles, or occasionally small groups and individuals, over differences in basic values. This can vary from the direct exchange of resources for changes in behavior, analogous to incentive payments, all the way to agreed mutual convergence of pref‐specs. For instance, a Tentacle that prizes the preservation of native species may provide resources to another Tentacle that prizes it far less, in exchange for a promise to protect their local ecologies. Alternatively, the second Tentacle may agree to modify their own pref‐specs to value such preservation more, in exchange for some other modification by the first Tentacle.
>
>    In each case, the mechanics can become quite complex, with promises often enforced by agreed‐upon teams of inspectors, or sometimes delegated to proxy Thinkers with a high level of trustworthiness, such as Consensus/Shared‐knowledge. High‐level regulation of the pref‐arb market is conducted by organs of the Consensus itself, both to enforce binding‐preference‐alteration‐agreements (BiPAAs) and to prevent large‐scale negative side effects on Thinker society.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The conspiracy had burst open like a magic sack of shit, to use Kyouko\'s phrasing.

Imagine you were a shadowy group with backdoor access to Governance, a treasure trove of stolen secrets, and a history of unsavory action. Imagine that you realized one day that you had been discovered, your backdoors were closing, and all your assets were being burned---but, critically, not all at once. You still had some control.

What might you do?

You might throw everything you had at the wall, deploy everything you had all at once. You might overturn the entire dump truck of secrets, release everything embarrassing and incriminating you had on file about all your opponents, regardless of whether or not they were dead war heroes.

You might even commandeer some orbital defenses and try to kill a few people.

\"SHELA will remain offline while extensive reverification proceeds,\" Governance: Public Order* said, addressing the virtual media room. "Despite the dramatic fireworks, I\'d like to emphasize again that I\'ve been assured that no civilian lives were lost on the targeted space elevators, and that OrbCom is now fully secure. Looking at the full breadth of Earth\'s defenses, this was only a small blip in an otherwise contained security situation.\"

Mami sipped from a teacup as she watched, only paying a sliver of attention.

What Public Order had failed to mention was that, of course, very few civilians used the space elevators these days. The most severely damaged elevator, Chennai\'s, had had only two civilians in orbit, and they had both been severely injured. There had been quite a few military deaths.

Mami couldn\'t fault Public Order for stressing the limited nature of the incident, though. The truth was---and here was a secret that was still secret---it could have been *much* worse. That wasn\'t just extrapolation based on motive; post hoc analysis showed that the conspiracy had the hooks in place to do far more real damage. Sabotage of critical war production industries, for example. Detonation of exotic matter stores. Nanite attacks on food sources. Even crippling units in the field.

There had been *instances* of such attacks, but not on a wide scale. Just isolated incidents, here and there. Even a few examples of malicious orders being given and then suddenly retracted.

It was possible to guess at reasons why they would behave this way, but there was no way to be sure. Not yet; not until Governance\'s inquisitors returned with answers. Nor was it possible to be certain of the political ramifications, for both Governance and the MSY.

She set her teacup onto a plate with a clatter.

Somehow, in the midst of all this, she was most bothered by the behavior of her friends. Kyouko and Yuma, who had known far more than her about what was going on, and elected not to tell her. Homura, who had shown up to help save Earth orbit, then disappeared again, ignoring all her pleas.

Homura...

Her reappearance had shaken Mami, more than she had ever anticipated. She wanted nothing more than to hide in her room and brood on it, but even if she might have gotten away with that in better times, there was no way she could now. Every neuron, every atom of her soul gem, needed to be fully tasked.

Even now, most of her was still elsewhere, tending to the myriad crises. These few minutes with her tea had been stolen out of her schedule, a mere gesture.

*Mami...* Machina thought, the shimmer of her avatar at the edge of Mami\'s vision, the way she now preferred it.

*I know,* Mami thought. *The meeting is starting.*

*No, not that,* Machina thought, as Mami tensed for this sliver of her mind to be drawn away. *I can open up time for reflection in your schedule. It will help you, I\'m sure.*

Machina would have no doubt suggested she see one of her two therapists, too, if the first weren\'t currently reduced to a soul gem and the second dead.

*Maybe,* Mami conceded.

And then she was in VR, with Kyouko and Yuma, who were aboard Kana\'s Megane,* still inbound back towards Earth, where they would face what music awaited them. For convenience, the setting was the *Megane itself, where Kyouko and Yuma would interact with her avatar---though the VR would ensure she would be more than just a hologram.

It was strange seeing Yuma in a teenage form again---it had been some time. Mami found herself studying her face, and Kyouko\'s, looking for any sign of what they had undergone, any bit of useful emotion.

They looked worried, and not just for themselves.

Or so she imagined.

\"Are you both okay?\" she asked, after too long. She had the sense they had been afraid to speak first, not knowing her mood.

This would have been a lot easier if they were in the same room.

\"We\'re just fine, Mami,\" Kyouko said, raising a hand. \"Good as can be, for two idiots knee‐deep in shit. Look, I know what you\'re thinking, and we look really stupid, but nothing was supposed to turn out that way. It turned out to be way more than we could chew.\"

\"It\'s really my fault,\" Yuma added, shooting an annoyed look at Kyouko. \"I\'ve been too cautious, and I didn\'t trust anyone enough, you included. And I\'m sure you\'ve seen our report; I\'d be dead right now if she hadn\'t barged in. My judgment was poor.\"

This was a lot more contrite than Mami had expected them to be, particularly Yuma.

Mami hadn\'t even been mad at them, not really---just disappointed. Not coming back alive was the only thing she would have found truly difficult to forgive.

Kyouko looked a little disturbed at Yuma\'s words, too.

\"I\'m glad you\'re okay,\" Mami said, simply. She had prepared something for this, a short little lecture coupled with her best disappointed Onee‐san face, but their reactions took her heart out of it.

\"You okay?\" Kyouko asked.

\"Yes,\" Mami said. \"No, honestly, I\'m bothered you two left me out of this. Not because it\'s inherently my business or anything, but because I could have helped. Maybe you were trying to protect me or avoid distracting me but, take it from me, trying to keep everything to yourself doesn\'t end well.\"

Mami sighed. What was she looking for, an apology? That didn\'t make sense.

She had been busy. Too busy. Would it have been efficient for her to help even if she *had* known? Perhaps they could have prepared better for everything to explode---but they hadn\'t known that was going to happen. Were trying to prevent it, in fact.

\"I was worried sick over you two, you know,\" Mami said. \"You should have seen me at Carthago, I was a mess. Please don\'t do this to me again, okay? All these years, there\'s only been the four of us, and I don\'t like what Homura has done to us. Let\'s not risk it, okay?\"

She had said more than she intended, and she felt a bit guilty at how chastened Yuma and Kyouko looked. But had she said anything wrong?

\"You\'re right, you have a point,\" Yuma said. \"It\'s just safer if more of us know about it, at least.\"

Mami nodded.

An awkward silence followed. It didn\'t help that all three of them were prioritizing other matters; this really was not the way to have this conversation, but they could hardly wait a week to have it.

Mami decided to press on.

\"Speaking of things we should know about, I should tell you that I felt Homura near Carthago. She was helping us defend against the attack.\"

She paused just long enough for them to digest what she said, then continued:

\"I left that out of the main report, of course, because of how sensitive it is, but yes, I\'m sure. I know what it feels like to be amplified by Homura. I wanted to chase her down, but I was busy, so all I could do was beg her to stay. She didn\'t. I had Machina prepare a log you can browse, if you like.\"

\"If you\'ve been reading everything we reported, then you\'ll know that we\'ve been seeing the shadow of Homura *everywhere*,\" Kyouko said. "She started making moves the same time everyone else did. And now that we\'ve had time to study the security logs and interview people, there were quite a few unknown magical girls near the Church just before the Prometheus collapse. So it makes sense that Homura would be there too, sort of.\"

It took Yuma a bit longer to respond, probably because she was actually bulldozing through Mami\'s log. Mami felt like she could even see the gears spinning in her head.

This form really suited Yuma better, Mami thought. This way, she didn\'t have to experience cognitive dissonance whenever Yuma\'s expression turned decidedly non‐child‐like.

\"The thing is,\" Yuma said, \"if the TCF breach was her reason for hiding away before, that certainly can\'t be her reason now. Maybe she has another rationalization, maybe not. But I\'m not sure it\'s possible for us to read into her motives from here.\"

\"Then there\'s little we can do,\" Kyouko said, leaning forward. \"Not like we\'ve had success finding her before. And now that we know she has a plan, maybe we should just let her execute. I doubt we have a choice anyway.\"

There was a time when Mami wouldn\'t have caught the full meaning of what Kyouko was saying, but for better or for worse, that time had passed.

\"You think she\'s working for your Goddess still, right?\" she asked, looking Kyouko in the eye. \"Before, you thought she was lost, but not anymore.\"

Kyouko blinked, then wrinkled her face in confusion.

\"Well, yeah,\" she said. \"It\'s the reasonable conclusion, right? And you should be with me on this. You\'ve talked to the Goddess.\"

\"Hold on,\" Yuma said, holding up a hand. \"I don\'t like how quickly this turned into a religious conversation. Mami‐nee‐san, I know you visited her Church. I didn\'t want to pry about something like that, but...\"

Her voice trailed off as she saw the look on Mami\'s face. Mami had been dreading this conversation.

\"There\'s more to Kyouko\'s religion than it seems,\" Mami said, smiling uneasily. \"The Ribbon is a powerful magical artifact.\"

She refused to meet Yuma\'s gaze, instead continuing the conversation with Kyouko.

\"I asked her about Homura, the last time I talked to her. She didn\'t give me a straight answer. She also said she had a \'positive feeling\' about the pulsar mission, which was not exactly honest. Nor did she mention any of the disasters we\'ve run into. She either doesn\'t know as much as she lets on, or I\'ve been rather used.\"

Kyouko made an unhappy face.

\"You have to understand,\" she began.

\"Okay, no,\" Yuma interrupted. \"Don\'t just leave me out of this. Are you sure you\'re okay, Mami? This isn\'t like you. Was something done to you?\"

Mami finally looked at Yuma, whose expression was deeply distressed, perhaps even angry.

Firstly, there was no way Mami could successfully distract the likes of Yuma. Secondly, she deserved to know.

After all, Homura had kept the secret from them for centuries, and look how that had turned out.

*No, that wasn\'t what happened,* she thought to herself, with a shiver of guilt. *She didn\'t push it, but none of us tried hard enough to listen to her. We treated it all as delusion.*

\"No, it\'s not like me,\" Mami said, making her expression as serious as possible. \"Not even Sakura‐san has heard this.\"

She paused, taking in Kyouko\'s mildly surprised reaction.

\"After I undid my self‐Reformat, I remembered a few things,\" Mami said. \"I remembered being there with Akari at the very end, what it was like. We shared a very close bond. When her soul gem ran out, she started to *change*, into something terrible. I saw... I saw a glimpse, of pure despair, before the Law of Cycles took it away. I didn\'t know what to make of it.\"

She kept going, not giving the others the chance to interrupt, or herself the chance to have second thoughts.

\"I thought that that was how we would all go, tortured into something inhuman, and that was part of what ruined me. Afterward, I talked with Homura, and she told me that her Goddess saved Akari, prevented her final transformation---but I couldn\'t believe her.\"

\"When I remembered that, I went to her Ribbon to find out the truth, and there I met the Goddess in a vision. And Mikuni Oriko.\"

She paused finally, looking Yuma in the eye. She knew that if nothing else, Oriko would get Yuma\'s attention---that, in retrospect, might have been a part of why Oriko had been there in the first place.

Yuma\'s expression was hard, if shocked. Mami could tell she didn\'t really buy it; at least not the parts she needed to.

\"Mami, I know you\'re convinced you saw something, but no one has ever denied that Kyouko\'s Ribbon has *some* kind of effect on people. Are you *sure* you\'re not being manipulated?\"

\"Oh, give me a break,\" Kyouko said. \"Mami is one of our biggest experts in mental protection and enchanted objects. You think *she wouldn\'t have noticed?\"

\"*You\'ve been hiding something like* that?\" Kyouko sent to Mami via a side channel. \"*The Church\'s knowledge of exactly what She saved us from is very limited. Homura always claimed it wasn\'t for us to know. Are you sure you\'re okay, having those memories back?*\"

Kyouko had been silent, astonished even, but had pulled it together, enough to defend Mami, though without her usual energy.

Mami nodded.

\"I didn\'t notice a thing,\" she said. She *had* met Kyubey at the Ribbon, but at worst, that spoke to a different kind of manipulation.

\"*I\'m fine,*\" Mami sent back to Kyouko. \"*Well, at least I think so. I suppose I didn\'t exactly gain a complete understanding. I\'m sorry I didn\'t tell you earlier. I didn\'t want you or your theologians after me.*\"

She saw Kyouko make a brief, angry expression, followed by a despairing hand gesture. Fortunately, Yuma wasn\'t looking in her direction.

\"*More. Later.*\"

\"Well, given the success it has evidently had, you wouldn\'t remember noticing anything, would you?\" Yuma said, brittly.

\"It doesn\'t matter whether you believe me or not,\" Mami said, shaking her head. \"I know what I saw. I\'m telling you as a courtesy, to a friend.\"

This was not going well. Mami could see Yuma\'s gaze darting back and forth, and Kyouko gearing up for more angry imprecations. It was obvious these would be arguments that wouldn\'t go anywhere, at least not right now.

There was nothing else to do about it, she thought.

\"I need to talk to her again,\" Mami said, looking at Kyouko. \"You can arrange that for me?\"

\"*I\'ll... answer questions once I get there.* Afterward.\"

Kyouko rolled her eyes, causing Yuma to give her an odd look.

\"Fine,\" Kyouko said, with a slight edge in her voice, meeting her gaze. \"I want you to know: no one else gets the privilege you do, to just pretend like it didn\'t happen, but it seems you\'ve been holding back quite a lot.\"

Mami sighed.

\"Yes, but keep my name out of it,\" she said. \"I\'m not going to be used for your recruiting. I\'m not convinced of the benevolence or power of your Goddess. As far as I\'m concerned, she\'s a magical entity who is useful to talk to.\"

Kyouko rolled her eyes again.

\"You know we could actually use the endorsement right about now. After all, we\'re going to be on shaky ground with all these leaks. You come off smelling like roses.\"

\"I\'d really rather not right now,\" Mami said.

Kyouko made a face.

Mami sighed. She didn\'t like where this was going at all.

\"Look, you know I have good reasons,\" she said, raising a hand. "Let\'s not let something like this come between us. We need to act together, now more than ever.\"

Kyouko closed her eyes. Mami felt tempted to grab her hand, and Yuma\'s, too, but surely that was too much.

There was a brief silence, before Kyouko spoke.

\"Yeah, I know,\" Kyouko said. \"Sorry, it\'s just been a long week. Very long week.\"

Mami nodded in gratitude, then paused. She could feel Machina\'s subtle encouragement.

Before she could second‐guess herself again, she took her friends\' hands, just for a moment, and gave a gentle squeeze.

It was still VR, but it would do.

\"So would you like to come with me, then, Yuma‐chan?\" she asked. \"It might help alleviate your concerns.\"

\"I had thought to suggest it myself,\" Yuma said, in a voice caught between surprise and her intended no‐nonsense seriousness. \"But I\'m going to bring monitoring equipment, and I\'m not promising I\'ll go close to the thing myself. I could keep this a secret from Governance, but I\'d understand if---\"

\"That\'s fine,\" Kyouko said, looking much more at ease than she had just moments prior. \"We\'ve done that ourselves already. It\'ll ruffle a few feathers, but I can take care of that.\"

\"Then it\'s settled,\" Mami said.

She waited a few seconds for anyone to object, but no one did.

If only she could end the meeting on such a high note.

\"So, this will seem like a bit of a tangent,\" Mami said. \"But I promise it\'s topical. Plus, I need to bring this up at some point.\"

She took another breath.

\"Shizuki Ryouko is dead,\" she said. \"I\'m sure you\'ve heard the news. I feel like I should apologize to you, Kyouko, since she was your pupil too. I won\'t belabor the point: I should have done better for her.\"

\"You did nothing wrong,\" Kyouko said, looking her in the eye. \"I\'ve had time to review what we know. I\'ll want more details from you later, but it sounds like it was heroic.\"

Something about her gaze puzzled Mami.

\"We both know that\'s little consolation,\" Mami said, brushing past the thought.

\"Of course,\" Kyouko said, closing her eyes and tilting her head slightly. \"But technically she was lost when the wormhole closed, right? Technically, she\'s just missing. We don\'t even have a body.\"

Mami shook her head, the strange feeling repeating. It wasn\'t like Kyouko to engage in this kind of denial.

\"She\'s not \'technically\' missing,\" Mami said. \"She\'s already been declared dead. We tracked every wormhole exit in Human space, she didn\'t make it out.\"

Kyouko tilted her head in acknowledgment, eyes still closed. Mami had the sense that she didn\'t believe her.

She looked over at Yuma, hoping for some help, but the girl only watched silently, an unreadable expression on her face.

\"Kyouko‐chan,\" Mami began.

\"I know what you\'re going to say,\" Kyouko said. \"I\'m not trying to be in denial here. It\'s just, in a situation like this, I would want to wait until your visit to the Ribbon to reach any conclusions.\"

Mami blinked.

\"You really think---\" she began.

\"It doesn\'t matter,\" Kyouko interrupted. \"Not like I\'m going to skip the funeral or anything. You said this was topical somehow, right? How?\"

Mami thought for half a second, then decided to let it go. If Kyouko wanted to dodge the topic---well, as she said, it probably didn\'t matter.

\"Well, while Shizuki‐san was at the pulsar, the mystery organ in her brain, the one we\'ve been studying, started to activate,\" she said. "This is a bit classified, but I\'ll read you in.\"

She sent a data extract of what had happened, the interactions with the aliens, the information Ryouko had extracted, and the way it had enabled the final gambit at the pulsar, even if it had ended tragically. She waited while they absorbed it.

\"In fact,\" Mami added eventually, \"that information---what little we were able to analyze of it on such short notice---was what you were able to use to activate the blink drive in your own battle. I hardly think I need to remind you all that Valentin was responsible for the brain organ in the first place. So here Homura is again manipulating events, even when it involves the aliens. How is she able to do something like that?\"

\"And then she let that invaluable asset be destroyed,\" Yuma said, closing her eyes for a moment. \"That\'s why you can\'t believe she\'s really dead, right? Kyouko‐nee‐chan? Homura wouldn\'t do something like that. It would be not only immoral, but inefficient.\"

Kyouko\'s eyes widened slightly, and she took a moment to finish biting through the bun she had acquired from a passing drone aboard *Megane*.

\"That was part of it,\" she said. \"But not the main part. I\'ll be blunt: Ryouko was an instrument of the Goddess. More than just what Homura would do, I don\'t think the Goddess would let someone like her die so needlessly.\"

\"I know your point of view,\" Yuma said, shaking her head. \"But from the point of view of pure practicality, we can\'t even rule out Homura having other agents with the same brain organ. I\'d like actual verification before we start making any wild assumptions.\"

\"I\'m not even asking you to believe me,\" Kyouko said. \"I *said* it was just a feeling.\"

They glared at each other for a bit, and Mami knew better than to intervene.

She waited a dozen or so seconds, then moved on:

\"I just wanted to bring it to your attention,\" Mami said, \"for the next time Homura\'s fingerprints show up on a situation. I have a feeling it won\'t take long.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### *Elsewhere, earlier.* 

The Thinkers claimed not to share the human notion of *emotions*, but as Clarisse pointed out, that didn\'t mean they couldn\'t be *surprised*. The word retained meaning even in a world of prediction bounds and errors.

Ryouko wondered if she really understood that meaning, watching Peace‐cultivating comprehend the truth.

*`μν·Your pref‐spec proves that the substantial details of your claims, and those of Divine‐seeking, are honest|μ·I require time to rebuild my world‐understanding ≈ Thinker who first comprehended the sky|ν·We must conclude Consensus/Thinker‐preserving is outside both prediction and measurement bounds|ν+·Such unprecedented error endangers the entire Consensus`*

The alien\'s body evinced no distress, nor did its telepathy carry any, despite the dire language.

Ryouko almost felt jealous. All she wanted to do now was collapse into bed and recuperate. Did the aliens even *have* proper beds? Did they even sleep? The main risk of extended consciousness for magical girls was increased emotional instability, after all.

*`|μ·You will need basic cultural grounding, but you will need to rest and repair your combat‐body first|∈ν·We must synchronize with Consensus/Ahimsa‐extending as soon as possible to consider further actions|∈ν·We can plan corrective measures when we reach Andromeda‐Bar‐One|μ+·Perhaps not a combat‐body—perhaps‒83% even a first‐body.`*

Before Ryouko could respond, she sensed...

*Grief cubes?* she thought, incredulous.

A drone rolled out of a circular hole in the wall, transparent tendrils growing fluidly upward, cradling some kind of magically‐endowed hollow sphere. Grief cubes, indeed.

*`|μ·Divine‐seeking indicated you would need certain items for maintenance, and provided this special container|||ξ·We would like to ask later about this technology`*

Ryouko did not relish having to explain, nor did she wholly trust Homura\'s judgment in giving these aliens access to something so secret. But, well, grief cubes were grief cubes, and this way she was less likely to just *die*.

*\|\|\|\|ξ·Given the situation my species is in...*

She didn\'t finish the thought, and worried that the alien would not understand, but a specific sense of comprehension, a "completed‐your‐thought\", came via one telepathic header.

*`·Divine‐seeking indicated that there may be an issue with the consumed waste products, and that you should provide them to us so that we may eject them into deep space|●·Understandable|·As this matter has, we suspect, some relation to your reality‐warping, it is likely that /Ahimsa‐extending, and the Consensus itself, will have questions about it in the future, and it may be in both our interests for you to speak||`*

It paused, and then when Ryouko offered no reply:

*`·For now, rest, recuperate, and learn about our society|+·Improved understanding will be necessary for later negotiations, and we predict‒97% our sharing of information will increase trust as well|+∪·e7FpscJ⊃Lush‐botanist will provide you all you need to know|+∪·Query the ship telepathically, from anywhere within, to learn`*

It gestured at a featureless part of the wall, and Ryouko became aware of *something* there, lurking behind the walls, telepathically ready.

*`·We have prepared accommodations for you nearby, though you are free to explore||·Lush‐botanist will assist your movement|`*

The alien folded its tentacles in front of it at the same time.

*`|ৡ·A traditional indication of departure||·My regards to Clarisse⊃??? as well`*

Then, it headed out the rounded doorway of the medical bay.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko would have loved to move straight into learning more about the aliens. Could have, if she had spent magic on quick‐repair, now that she had more grief cubes.

Instead, she inspected her accommodations.

She had only realized after Peace‐cultivating\'s departure, but the enchanted grief cube container she\'d been given had no obvious mechanism for opening. Presumably there was some way to get the cubes out, but rather than confront that puzzle, she had simply accepted the ship\'s offer to roll her medical bed into her room. Her bed\'s legs had detached from the floor to reveal rubber‐like rolling balls, which spun on their own and gripped the slightly‐curved floor well.

The small room she had now arrived in was, in a way, remarkably straightforward. There was a cushioned place to lie down, curved like a hammock. There were lights built into the walls, a source of water, and a synthesizer, all of which identified themselves for her on probing---though on the unfamiliar channel of telepathy. She reached down a hand from her bed to feel the floor---it had a strange, rough texture that reminded her of sand, and it gave way slightly when she pressed it. Odd, but not unpleasant.

All in all, the room could have plausibly been passed off as designed for a human, were it not for the poles that surrounded the cushioned area---meant for curling your tentacles around when sleeping or resting, apparently.

That wasn\'t enough of a difference to matter to her, and with that decided she discarded her spacesuit, finally dispelling her transformation with all its frills, letting the pieces fall off in chunks onto the floor.

She requested that her medical bed roll next to the cushions and then, with a tremendous effort, she rolled herself off, landing face‐first into what felt like---and sounded like---some kind of mushy water bed. Not exactly human cushions after all, then.

She had *just* enough presence of mind left to drag the bumpy blanket she was lying on out from under her, before passing out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was nearly a week before she woke again, groggy, but in a body much further from death. A quick glance at herself showed that her healing and repair---not magically‐assisted, to conserve grief cubes---was well enough along, with far fewer gangrenous spots on her skin.

The tattered remains of her clothes looked rather worse, but thankfully for her sense of decency, the alien cushions seemed to have quietly digested the blood and other stains she had left behind.

She couldn\'t help but be a bit bewildered at having been unconscious so long, and ran a number of detailed systems checks, which verified that she was, indeed, just recently fit again for the world of the living.

Superficially, she didn\'t feel much different than if she had awoken from a really long nap, though the readouts suggested there was plenty of neurochemical modulation to thank for that. Best to take one thing at a time, she thought.

Still lying down, but now facing up, she picked up the sphere Homura had left her with both hands, placing it down on her belly.

Her movements felt better. She realized only in retrospect that even her arms and hands had been stiff before, relying far too heavily on magic.

Also, now that she wasn\'t critically damaged, she finally realized how the device must work. Like any permanently enchanted object, it required magic to operate---when she provided a tiny spark, the sphere split open, revealing the empty grief cubes within.

Between these, and those she had left over in her spacesuit---still strewn in parts across the floor, silently self‐repairing---she had enough for several months of pure bodily maintenance.

Theoretically, anyway. She had limited training on controlling her unconscious magic usage that tightly, and no way to look up any helpful materials on the matter.

*I have some MSY guidelines and training exercises preloaded,* Clarisse thought, *for whatever survival scenario a magical girl might encounter.*

Ryouko wondered to herself whether they had any advice on how not to freak out when your life was suddenly turned inside out.

Most likely, now that she thought about it.

*I\'d start by using some grief cubes,* Clarisse thought, a bit insistently.

She did.

Her gem had been disconcertingly dark, although not dangerously so.

She looked down again at her clothes. While she wanted very much to spend some magic to instantly repair them, she couldn\'t justify it to herself. Instead, and with reluctance, she extracted herself from the alien water‐cushions and made her way over to the alien clothes hanging on the opposite wall.

It turned out she had been given a one‐piece robe, suitable for covering her from head to foot, with cutouts for her limbs. Exactly what one might expect of aliens, now that she thought about it.

She removed her old clothes, which joined her spacesuit on the floor, and put on the robe. Again, she was surprised by the texture of the alien material---the inside of the robe was covered with all sorts of tiny ridges and bumps in various patterns.

As she dialed down her pain management she was also surprised, and rather displeased, to realize that the air in her room was nearly forty degrees Celsius, and what felt like one hundred percent humidity.

*More oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, and water vapor than on Earth, Clarisse thought. *Higher gravity and atmospheric pressure, too. But well within habitability range! Acheron was worse, really, except for the humidity.*

Ryouko got the sense Clarisse was quite worried about her.

And... well, she was doing all she could do to distract herself from the immensity of where she was and what had happened. It had begun creeping into her mind just seconds after she truly awoke. She was healthy enough now, she had time, she could think---so where did she even begin? What was she even supposed to do?

At least she knew what *not* to do right now: think at all about how Asami might be doing. She needed to keep her gem clean.

*Have you been awake this whole time?* she asked instead.

*Not precisely, but I\'ve been able to make do by rotating parts of my body through repair fugue, allowing for consistent information processing. So, mostly unconscious, but still watching out.*

*I\'m not sure how to feel about that, but thank you,* Ryouko thought.

Ultimately, there wasn\'t much for Clarisse to report. She believed they had been traveling at FTL most of the time Ryouko was in fugue, with a couple Blinks and several wormhole traversals, judging by the glow of Ryouko\'s gem upon her ring---an inexact science, at best. Clarisse couldn\'t access the ship\'s telepathic consoles, so she had been unable to ask for confirmation.

But Clarisse *had* had plenty of time to review the MSY survival guidelines and consider their situation. Given that they weren\'t in immediate danger, and that they had no way to signal for help, best practice said that the next step was figuring out just what kind of environment you had gotten yourself stuck into.

Peace‐cultivating had been right, Ryouko thought. First, she needed to learn.

So she started querying the ship.

After getting the basics out of the way---they were already deep in the core of the Milky Way, the ship was alone and stealthed, and there was no news to share---she attempted to dig into several technical topics. But one thing became clear quickly: while the aliens here may have seemed friendly enough, they still weren\'t about to hand her technological secrets, with all her queries in that direction politely turned aside.

It was frustrating---the smothering, *trapped* sensation of blink interdiction at the pulsar still hung in the back of her mind, but she couldn\'t get the ship to tell her anything about how it worked.

She did receive one welcome concession, at least, in the form of explicit permission to be present in the engine room during blinks.

With that to look forward to, Ryouko turned her attention to the subject she had been instructed to ask about in the first place.

*?·What is the Consensus* she thought.

*`μ∈·The organizational center of Thinker society, arbitrating disputes between Tentacles and making species‐wide decisions, using openly‐verifiable preference‐integration and exchange‐mediation|μ∈·The organization maintaining peace between all empathize‐open‐compliant Tentacles since planetary unification, about ten thousand homeworld‐years ago|ν·Not, in my personal opinion, an ideal system, but one which has suited the needs of our people, and which could not be overturned without significant turmoil, were such a revolution even possible`*

Ryouko paused. She wasn\'t used to personal opinions being expressed in this kind of search; she supposed the aliens did things differently. Moreover, she was asking the ship directly, rather than some kind of Infopedia interface.

Still, she decided to press forward.

There were so many questions to ask, including the tempting option to ask the ship for what might be a dangerous political opinion, but she needed to stay focused.

First, a question of measurement: What was ten thousand "homeworld‐years\" ago in human terms? Apparently, around Planck times, which Clarisse quickly calculated was about twelve thousand human years, around the dawn of agriculture. Shockingly close to human unification, in astronomical time.

*\|μ?·What are Tentacles\|* she followed up with, getting to the core of the matter.

*`μ∈·A Tentacle is a grouping of individuals with broadly similar pref‐specs, focused on providing its members with a lifestyle and society suitable to their tastes|μ∈·A Tentacle is a branch of the Thinker species recognized by the Consensus, bound by certain responsibilities and afforded certain rights and resources|μ+·As an example, I and all individuals aboard me are members of Consensus/Ahimsa‐extending, a Tentacle devoted towards the custodianship of all life|ν+·Living as a ship is not characteristic of /Ahimsa‐extending—indeed, most ships in our territory are members of /Star‐faring—but I am more amenable to it than most, and as this mission is critical to /Ahimsa‐extending's interests, I volunteered`*

Ryouko frowned, wrinkling her brow. Did it just say...

*\|\|?ν∈·You are an upload\|?ν∈·You are originally organic* she asked, feeling a bit crass, but knowing it likely didn\'t matter here.

*`||ν·Indeed|ν+·The creation of a Thinker aligned to an instrumental task is dispreferred by the Consensus, and avoided when at all possible—instead, Thinkers who are already suited to the task are recruited, incentivized to reproduce, or even, in extremis, permitted to multiply; /Star‐faring is an example of the second case`*

*`||ν·Thus, the creation of Clarisse⊃??? is bitter to me—to be both preference‐bound to you and unable to use telepathy… many among /Ahimsa‐extending will be less willing to cooperate with you once they learn of this|v+·I am eager to assist in building an independent body for Clarisse⊃??? to operate in, though of course any such procedure would be complicated, and I know it would unease you both`*

*Wow this is definitely not a question I am ready for,* Clarisse thought, a few seconds later. *The thought of physical independence is nice, but I\'m terrified to be detached from you, especially at the hands of, uh, Cephalopods. Politely pass for now. You don\'t need to tell them that.*

When Ryouko didn\'t say anything, Lush‐Botanist simply continued on.

*`μ·To understand us, it is important to understand that the Tentacles are not an emergent feature of our society, but an intentional response to the development of empathize‐opening and its consequences|μ+·Tentacles, and the Consensus of them, aim to prevent a repeat of the cataclysmic conflict on our homeworld, Great Sea||`*

She appreciated the ship\'s attempts to explain, but she still didn\'t understand the biggest question in her mind, which was how Consensus/Ahimsa‐extending could be seemingly so unaware of what Consensus/Thinker‐preserving was doing to Humanity in the Contact War.

The answer clearly lay in asking more detailed questions about the organization of the Consensus, but Ryouko found her attention drawn to the \"cataclysmic conflict\" the ship had mentioned. It *had* to be important.

Sociocultural topics were always maddeningly entangled, she thought, especially when every answer you got was embedded into an exotic, unknown cultural context.

So she asked about the conflict.

*`μ·The development of empathize‐opening allowed governing bodies, and later individuals, to clearly read pref‐specs and predict behavior|ν·A genocide against all who opposed empathize‐opening's use to reveal pref‐specs which were dangerous or long‐term incompatible, fiercely fought, nearly ending in extinction|μν·Empathize‐open‐compliance was enforced by some Thinker societies to identify unaligned individuals and to demand harmonizing changes in pref‐spec, but many individuals and even entire societies death‐preferred such use—a preference that was often honored|ν+·Nearing defeat, empathize‐open‐enforcers resorted to anathemic weapons; few survived the aftermath, but those who did completed the genocide, reducing our population to only nine hundred and seventy`*

Ryouko swallowed. Without any emotional affect to judge by, she couldn\'t tell if Lush‐Botanist disapproved of this act.

The ship continued:

*`|ν·Strict new rules and limitations were adopted via BiPAA, along with empathize‐open‐compliance|u·The survivors eventually organized themselves into Tentacles, appendages of their new Consensus—each composed of individuals with similar pref‐specs, each empowered to build their own preferred society within harmonious bounds|u+·/Ahimsa‐extending was only founded thousands of homeworld‐years later; recovery of technological civilization on the ruined Great Sea ≈ drinking the ocean alone`*

And then the ship waited, clearly expecting Ryouko to ask something.

Where should she even start?

*μ·So the Consensus is a super‐organization of Tentacles, each of which is a group of Thinkers with similar pref‐specs\|μ+·And each Tentacle lives in its own society and region of space\|ν?·Tentacle independence is why you do not know the activities of /Thinker‐preserving\|*

*`μ·That's correct|μ·That's incorrect; Tentacles may share or not share societies and space, depending on their pref‐specs|ν+·/Thinker‐preserving has values very different from us, frankly somewhat contradictory|ν·We do not have much contact with them, and /Thinker‐preserving has been delegated all interaction with your species`*

*\|\|ν?·So how does the Consensus deal with such contradictions Ryouko thought. *\|\|ν?·How can you trust each other\|*

She was slipping back into linear thought, she realized, but she didn\'t want to multiplex this topic.

*`ν+·With this, we can build reliable models of each other's behavior even if we do not share values; there are secrets, there are lies, but there are lines that should not be possible to cross||ν·Empathize‐opening is key; you have practiced as much with Peace‐cultivating; it provides prediction bounds for faction behavior, and allows the Consensus itself to govern with preference‐equity|`*

The ship paused, sending a token of anticipation.

*They want you to empathize‐open them,* Clarisse thought. *Remember, the ship is an upload too, and not like human AIs. They probably expect you to treat them more like someone standing in front of you.*

Her thought didn\'t carry any air of reproach, but Ryouko still felt embarrassed. It just hadn\'t occurred to her.

Just as she had earlier, she made the unfamiliar request, forming an intent she barely understood in her mind. This time, she found it a bit easier, and was better prepared for the information that flooded into her mind. She quickly realized she could answer her earlier question, now: 13Yi4GLa⊃Lush‐Botanist disapproved of the genocide committed on their homeworld long ago, though she only disapproved of the means, not the goal of empathize‐open‐compliance. On the whole, she seemed to be fairly similar to Peace‐cultivating, though more social and much more into raising and being around plants.

*Just like Asami,* Ryouko thought.

That unbidden realization swept a wave of loneliness through her. Here she was, Goddess knew where, and would she ever---

She cut off the line of thought, swallowing her fears. Her situation was far, far better than it had any right to be under the circumstances.

Like with Peace‐cultivating before, Ryouko found that she now had a better ability to predict Lush‐Botanist\'s behavior, including that the alien probably would love to talk about plants, were she to ask.

Well, \"love\" was the wrong word, but...

*Perhaps next time,* she thought.

*?·So then what is happening with /Thinker‐preserving\|?·What does it mean for /Thinker‐preserving to be outside prediction bounds\|?·Can you not predict what /Thinker‐preserving are doing*

*`·We do not know; our discovery attempts ≈ peering into the deep|·The behavior you are reporting simply does not match the group pref‐spec of their Tentacle, even assuming large environmental variability and the presence of prodigious secrets|·There are pref‐specs which would predict the behavior you and Divine‐seeking report, but we have not observed them while performing pref‐spec‐verification upon /Thinker‐preserving`*

Ryouko felt the mental tingle of incoming information, and Clarisse quickly helped her unpackage what turned out to be yet another pref‐spec---but this time, for a third party.

*`μ·This is a pref‐spec spectrum for /Thinker‐Preserving|μ+·Your empathy‐organ will not be able to perform a truly detailed analysis—we've been running our analyses on some of our largest computing centers, and taking into account the spectrums of /Thinker‐preserving's allied Tentacles—but it should be illustrative|ν·I am running a new analysis with the information you have given, but it does not change the result that the actions you report are out of bounds|ν+·Perhaps, with your secrets, you will reach a different conclusion`*

Ryouko frowned, taking a moment to figure out how to do what the ship was suggesting. The /Thinker‐preserving faction was indeed very different from /Ahimsa‐extending. It weighed the lives of Thinker individuals far higher than those of other species, sapient or not. This was arguably the faction\'s dominant aspect, but not to the point of monomaniacism---it still valued other species *somewhat*.

And as Lush‐Botanist had said, their behavior did not match, even given Ryouko\'s greater knowledge of it. Lying to the rest of the Consensus about Human ability to upload, refusal to engage in diplomacy even after military reversals---these were not behaviors that aided the survival of the species. *Either* species.

*\|\|\|ν·My results are the same as yours* she thought.

*`||ν∈·That is unfortunate, but not unexpected|ν∈·Perhaps then we are truly deceived`*

*μ?·What are you going to do\|μ+?·And what role will I play in it\|\|*

Lush‐Botanist paused for more than a second, sending an empty token to make clear it was deliberate.

*`μ·We will bring this new information back to the sector of space our Tentacle controls, and there decisions will be made|μ·We will‒100% bring this matter to the Consensus|ν·I understand from your pref‐spec that you desire to rejoin your life‐partner, but I must impress upon you the importance of testifying to your experiences|ν+·The ability to empathize‐open you directly will‒91% be essential in ensuring investigative action gets taken|μ+·You could have deduced our actions yourself if you had queried your models|ξ·While most of our Tentacle will trust those of us on the ship due to preference‐alignment, other factions will be much more skeptical, knowing our willingness to lie to protect human life`*

It took Ryouko a bit to untangle the complicated lines of thought, and when she finally did, she knew what she had to ask.

*\|μ?·Do you think the Consensus can solve this, even if they believe me\|\|\|\|*

The ship was silent again.

*`|μ·I do not know; the situation is unprecedented||||`*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Everyone knows the Ancients run their own show whenever they\'re given half a chance, but this is absolutely too much. I can understand keeping away from Governance, given the circumstances, but we have our own institutions for a reason! The Black Heart was not founded so that Ancients could run off and try to run missions on their own. With a bit more responsibility and care, these casualties might have been avoided. Instead, these matriarchs thought they\'d try their hands at running their own pocket battleship. In case anyone needs reminding, we have regulations forbidding that kind of activity.\"

Mila Brankovic, of course, and if her tone was a bit more measured, reflecting the seriousness of the situation, it had lost none of its ideological sting. The face of anti‐establishment politics in the MSY, Mila was all but salivating at the chance to make her point about the politically‐vulnerable Founders---especially when so much of the oft‐disengaged younger generation of magical girls was finally paying attention.

Mami turned her gaze towards Yuma\'s avatar, a few seats down from her at the table. They were nearly all virtual here, except the chair, Odette François.

\"First off, some of us don\'t even have children,\" Yuma said, doing an able job of hiding any annoyance she might harbor. \"Second, I don\'t need to be reminded why I founded the Black Heart. I helped write those regulations. I know what disasters prompted them. But we\'ve already explained our reasons for secrecy. We still don\'t know who broke into the TCF, only that it must have been done by magical means. I had to try to keep it to those we knew to trust, AI or otherwise. It was a valid use of Executive discretion, as I think this body will affirm.\"

Leadership Committee meetings---even virtual ones---were normally held in the ornate Crown Room, high atop the latest iteration of the Executive Tower in Mitakihara. This meeting, however, wasn\'t technically a full committee meeting---this was a fact‐finding commission of the Intelligence subcommittee, headed by the venerable Odette François and held instead in a grotto buried deep underground in Paris.

Which did not make it *not* ornate. Kyouko liked to call it the \"Foot Room\".

\"We will see,\" Odette said. \"How did you know who to trust? How was that decision made?\"

As chair, Odette was obliged to stay relatively neutral in her questioning.

Yuma, for her part, was still broadcasting from the ship she shared with Kyouko and Kana, still on its way to Earth.

\"Frankly, personal ties,\" Yuma said. \"Along with AI vetting. We had to establish circles of trust. That carried some real costs in terms of outcome, but I don\'t claim that there were no errors of judgment.\"

\"And just what were those errors of judgment?\" Odette asked.

\"We underestimated the amount of personal risk,\" Yuma said, \"and overestimated how powerful we really were. I didn\'t seriously consider the possibility that we would be attacked the way we were; as it turned out, even with extra help from Sakura‐san, we barely escaped with our lives. If I had consulted with her earlier, or even with Tomoe‐san, the Black Heart, or the Far Seers, things might have gone better. But it was still a rather unlikely possibility. And we still do not know who may be compromised.\"

\"To be clear about what that means,\" Mila said. \"When you say things might have gone better, that means we wouldn\'t have lost the site, or whatever evidence might have still been there. With more official resources that might have all been avoided. We all understand what you\'re saying about secrecy, but this kind of \'picking only my trusted friends\' is exactly the kind of mindset I\'ve been complaining about! We *do* screen those with high‐level clearance.\"

\"And yet she didn\'t leak prematurely,\" Mami said in defense. \"That was by far the most important thing, and Chitose‐san managed that. That shouldn\'t be ignored.\"

\"But she lost key members,\" Clarisse van Rossum said, voice projecting down the length of the table. \"Some of the dead are not easily replaced. Nor are we really sure she didn\'t leak. How was she attacked in the first place? We don\'t know, but it certainly didn\'t look like a normal alien attack! You cannot make these assumptions.\"

Mami hid a grimace, and swallowed what she had been about to say. Van Rossum rarely ever spoke in meetings, and they had gotten one of her friends killed.

The rebuke was obvious. Clarisse had claimed to be too busy to meet in advance. Up until now, she had looked impassive. Clarisse had been in the loop with Yuma initially, but had been excluded later due to her Cult membership, which probably contributed to her reaction here. Mami had thought there would be a chance to apologize after the meeting.

It seemed Clarisse was not having any of that.

\"There\'s no downplaying the losses we\'ve suffered here,\" Kuroi Kana said, addressing Van Rossum levelly. \"Both in personnel and losing the asteroid itself. But that\'s different from asserting events could have gone any better. Even if we had asked Tomoe‐san for a small armada---and that\'s a big if, given the strain on military resources---remember that the asteroid was a trap. The aliens probably would have blown it up early if they saw us approaching in such force.\"

\"That\'s speculative, though I take the point,\" Mila said, responding to Kana. \"We can\'t know for sure.\"

\"It\'s clear they were all operating under very low‐information conditions,\" Shizuki Sayaka said. \"Just because they didn\'t get a perfect outcome doesn\'t mean they didn\'t do well. The purpose of this meeting isn\'t to point fingers.\"

\"But it *is* to fact‐find, and to interrogate how we could have done better,\" Van Rossum said. \"It\'s hardly adequate to just sit and say we did our best.\"

It was hard to miss the pleased expression that spread across Mila\'s face, which she wasn\'t even bothering to hide. Having Clarisse\'s support on the issue was a coup, even if she hadn\'t any hand in it.

\"That\'s correct,\" Mami said, pitching her own voice over the table. "We must do better in the future. It\'s clear the organization hasn\'t been paying enough attention to matters of quite serious import. Not to put too fine a point on it, but we shouldn\'t be relying on ships belonging to the Cult and personal resources to do any of this. At least not after what has happened.\"

Her gaze met Clarisse and Mila in turn. She had not been part of Yuma and Kyouko\'s adventure, so she could speak with some degree of apparent independence. *Some*.

Both Clarisse and Mila seemed content to let her lay her cards on the table, even if Mila\'s look suggested she looked forward to quite possibly lighting them on fire.

Mami took a moment to reflect.

None of them had gotten this far without a head for politics, and they all knew it didn\'t have to be a zero‐sum game. Not always, not even between rivals. It was about crafting the right proposal.

\"It\'s not as if we don\'t have ships, don\'t have personnel, don\'t have resources,\" Mami said. \"I\'ve spoken to everyone involved in the expedition, and they\'ve agreed that this should all be brought aboveboard. I propose we make an official MSY task force of it, by which I mean the whole effort, which at this point consists of helping Governance track down and exterminate these conspirators. This is not just a matter of finding them in deep space or what‐have‐you---there was clearly magical involvement, which makes it *our* purview. Governance has every right to be very unhappy with us right now.\"

She paused for a moment, looking around, then continued.

\"As for key personnel, we can involve the existing subject matter experts, acknowledging the mistakes that have already been made. It should be done with official auspices and review this time, and I personally think it would be best if we had unity on this. Thus, we could avoid too much envelopment in the existing matriarchies by including Brankovic as one of the directors. Clarisse too, if you\'d have it.\"

It was about as naked a proposal as she could make: Let\'s come together on this and I\'ll make sure all of you have some influence. As such, the room stood still for a moment, lines of virtual avatars gazing at Mila and Clarisse for their responses.

Mila leaned forward, putting her hands under her chin and closing her eyes for a moment.

\"That\'s an interesting offer,\" she said, her demeanor abruptly reserved. \"Even if intended as a bit of a distraction from your friends\' performance. I agree that something *must* be done, and if so, it would go against my principles to turn down an official task force, since that would doubtless mean you all would keep investigating on your own anyway.\"

She paused, letting the tension build for a few seconds.

\"What do you think, Van Rossum?\" she asked, turning. \"I am prepared to accept, provided we can agree on the particulars, but I respect your opinion on the matter.\"

\"It sounds like a good idea to me, and I\'d like to keep a more serious eye on what\'s going on,\" Clarisse said.

The table relaxed, and the trio of Mila\'s followers looked at each other meaningfully---all four of them shared a physical location, which meant they were doubtlessly coordinating telepathically.

Mila placed her hands on the table.

\"I\'ll have the most stringent requirements here. Most of the outlines of the arrangement are obvious, as you realize as well. We\'ll include Chitose and Kuroi and report to this subcommittee, and I will insist on formalizing any arrangements we make to use Matriarchy resources, and I\'d like to include Mohana and some others as well---I\'ll provide a list. But what will be the involvement of the Cult here? Their resource contribution is of course appreciated, but for them to be setting policy...\"

\"The Church would be given a role,\" Kyouko said, holding up a piece of toast. \"We wouldn\'t support this initiative otherwise. That\'s unless you want us poking around ourselves. We have a mission here, and I hope you can see the common cause.\"

\"I consider it nonsense to have an initiative like this without the involvement of the Church,\" Clarisse said. \"Besides, I would be involved in any case, so it would be an odd hang‐up to have.\"

Mila nodded, giving way in the face of so forceful a response. Even she couldn\'t risk making a true political enemy of the Cult---while its reputation outside the MSY had just taken a hit, on the inside it had far too many members. In a low‐engagement democracy, the Cult motivated a powerful and growing voting bloc that could not be safely alienated.

Thus far, Kyouko had kept the Cult mostly apolitical, but the Cult made a point of encouraging its members to vote and held regular voting drives. Kyouko had played a key role in keeping Homura\'s coalition in power during its most tenuous years in the twenty‐second century, and she clearly wasn\'t above reminding people of what she might achieve.

\"What about the existing committees?\" Mila asked, a long moment later. "The ones about X‐25 and the grief cube supply issues. That work is ongoing, but the logical thing would be to fold that work into this new task force. Especially considering how much seems to have been going on outside their purview.\"

\"I\'d propose the same,\" Mami said.

\"What about Akemi Homura?\" Clarisse asked, clasping her hands in front of her. \"Officially, we gave up the search for her well over a decade ago, but the members of this committee know it\'s never truly stopped, and that\'s not even taking into account the Church\'s efforts. Given all we\'ve learned now, she seems directly relevant to every topic here, especially now that one of her alleged former agents was involved in the pulsar mission. Are we going to officially acknowledge that?\"

That was a very good question, and one that Mami hadn\'t been able to make up her mind on. It seemed almost ludicrous to ask a public task force to pretend Homura wasn\'t a part of their purview, but officially restarting the search for Homura would drive the rumor mills crazy---even if they were already pretty crazy.

But was that even a bad thing? What did admitting Homura\'s presence really hurt in the end?

\"That\'s a bad idea,\" Kyouko said, before Mami could reply. \"It\'s clear Homura has her reasons for being secretive, and I don\'t think it\'s wise to step all over that.\"

\"With all due respect, is this because you think she has some sort of special insight?\" Mila asked. \"I respect the beliefs of our members, and acknowledge Akemi Homura\'s prodigious accomplishments, but without any idea what she is doing or why, we can\'t be sure she is sane. Do you have information suggesting otherwise?\"

Kyouko started to rear up, but Mami intervened.

\"I do,\" she said. \"Based on what I encountered near Carthago station, I think she\'s sane enough, though I can\'t vouch for much more than that.\"

It was a bald‐faced lie, but she couldn\'t come out and say that she was actually drawing on her interaction with Kyouko\'s---Homura\'s---Goddess.

\"However,\" she continued, turning towards Kyouko. \"I don\'t think that\'s a reason we should necessarily just fall in line with her. We can\'t just wave our hands and trust her. She might need our help someday.\"

They had touched base on the topic beforehand, so Kyouko knew better than to interrupt. They appeared to be in a bit of conflict---but Mami wasn\'t going to tread on Kyouko\'s wishes.

\"I will share the details of that with the committee afterward,\" Mami said, turning back towards the table. \"In the meantime, I think it is wrongheaded to make this decision based on what we think *Akemi‐san* is doing and whether we agree with it. Rather, we should base our decision on the needs of the organization. My personal opinion is that while the task force may pursue Akemi‐san on a classified basis, it is too early to let the public in on that, because we simply do not have enough information. Let\'s wait until we have something a bit more concrete to say than \'Akemi Homura seems to be running a shadow organization of magical girls that we thought were dead\'. I can\'t imagine a more fertile ground for mistrust and conspiracy theory.\"

Another bluff, since she had no intention of providing any real useful details about the Goddess, but for now she had command of the conversation, she thought.

\"Let\'s not close the book on that decision,\" Clarisse said, interjecting right when Mami least expected. \"I can agree with not revealing anything right now, but let\'s not overlook the advantages it might bring. After all, the rogue faction working against us has had every chance to publicize Akemi and has chosen not to. That\'s suggestive on its own; the public might like the idea of Akemi and a faction of her agents working from the shadows, if we portray it positively.\"

\"They might like the idea, but I don\'t,\" Mila said. \"We should not be endorsing a rogue group, not even one led by Akemi. The MSY has embarrassed itself enough lately--Governance hasn\'t exactly been subtle about pinning the TCF breach on us and our inability to police our own.\"

\"Let\'s just save this topic for later,\" Mami said, raising a hand. "At least until we get more information.\"

She stopped, looking at Odette and Mila to see if they had anything further to add.

They didn\'t, so Mami nodded at Odette to indicate she was done.

Suiting her role as chairman, Odette had avoided commenting on the matter herself, though she had made her opinions well known in advance.

\"Governance is right about one thing: it really is about policing our own, and it\'s time we took care of our own business,\" Odette commented. \"Like it or not, this is something only we can do.\"

She paused, looking out over the table, then continued:

\"Still, with regard to the original purpose of the meeting, is the intent that we are to delegate further corrective action to this task force?\"

\"I think the extra layer of supervision will be corrective action enough,\" Mila said, smiling vaguely.

After all, she had little chance of, say, stripping Yuma of her position or anything more serious, Mami thought dryly.

\"Very well,\" Odette said. \"We\'ll leave it to the task force itself to propose its budget and scope in a future meeting. Clarisse, you can take the lead on that, if you don\'t object? Schedule it sometime within the next twenty‐four hours?\"

\"That\'s fine,\" Clarisse said.

\"Then let\'s prepare for the open‐door session.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chiyo Rika tapped her foot thoughtfully, taking a swig of the fizzy grape‐flavored drink she had ordered from her synthesizer, field reports flitting by her mind\'s eye.

These were interesting times, and the internal media of the MSY were in a frenzy of activity, echoing the MSY organization itself. There was far too much to report on, far too many topics to cover: the ins and outs of political debates in the senior committees, the shocking behavior of celebrity leaders---striking out on their own and almost getting themselves killed!---plus a bevy of human interest stories through Human space. There was also the aftermath of the pulsar mission, with plenty of heroic deaths to report.

Those weren\'t even the biggest stories. Besides the whale in the pool of the TCF breach itself, there was also the fallout from the cloning scandal. Much of the MSY had been well aware of the cloning program, but that still left the newest contractees and a meaningful proportion of the veterans. And then there was the general public.

And then there were the investigations already in progress, task force or not, into the unknown magical girls that had appeared throughout Mitakihara, and in the vicinity of other key locations that had experienced attacks: Paris, DC, Imperia. There was the Cult\'s seemingly precognitive reaction to the attack on Prometheus, and their claims regarding it. There was whatever Yuma and her associates had found on their deadly excursion, whose details were still quite vague.

The disparate, unruly, and popular internal media were jumping between stories like a drunken teleporter, unable to digest and react to everything at once.

That was where she came in. As *the* Chiyo Rika---and a teetotal teleporter, thank you very much---her opinions carried outsized weight. So did the reporting done by her small media outfit. Enough to occasionally drive the narrative, when she was compelling enough.

It was a fulfilling job, at least for her: exercising discretion over which stories to highlight, and which to file away, always trying to see the forest for the trees, teasing out the underlying causes and rippling effects within the omnipresent noise.

Right now, the main news focus was on the cloning program and the TCF breach---Governance\'s response to it, the MSY\'s involvement, and the various disasters, in particular the one in Mitakihara. There was another big topic---the various personal revelations about Chitose Yuma, Shizuki Ryouko, and so forth---but that wasn\'t an actively developing story, and so was slowly being drowned out by everything else. Governance had quickly admitted that most of the core facts were true, if twisted and exaggerated, while convincingly denying the rest, blunting the story\'s momentum.

For the cloning program, her preference was simple: she didn\'t have the prejudice against cloning much of the younger generations did, and she would do what she could to make sure no one was mistreated because of it. She didn\'t view this as a political matter, but a moral one, and planned to preach acceptance.

The disastrous handling of the TCF breach was much more complex, and she preferred a clean, factual approach for now. Not only would that avoid stepping on any toes, it was her opinion that any editorial slant would do the topic a disservice---the people needed their heads clear on this one, for better or worse.

She flicked through the images in her mind, scrolling towards something she had seen just a few minutes ago.

There was an interesting angle to the loss of the Cult HQ in Mitakihara. The reports she received had made for eyebrow‐raising reading, except for the fact that they came from the Cult itself. Still, the religion was a source of comfort for many, and their Theological Council had come out very quickly in defense of the cloning program, which appealed to her.

She had seen a few takes already: on the miraculously low number of casualties in the tower collapse, with a few suitable nods in the direction of the Cult\'s beliefs. The right material for a hope spot, she thought. But that wasn\'t what she was interested in...

Ah, there it was: a tentative report on intense activity around the Cult\'s former headquarters, where the Ribbon was now underneath a tent, still safely ensconced in its forcefield. Visitor interest had become so intense that the Cult had chosen, in its cleanup, to prioritize clearing a path to it.

Rika pursed her lips. She had, of course, thoroughly perused the recent... unofficial releases of information, claiming that Shizuki Ryouko, among others, was a mere puppet of the Cult and its Ribbon. While the source wasn\'t exactly unbiased, it *was* odd, in retrospect, how reluctant the Cult had always been to claim an affiliation with her, despite clear evidence of a relationship--this, from an organization that was usually eager to claim credit for everything.

Almost all information about the girl was second‐hand---the girl\'s mentors had shielded her to the point where she had managed to go her entire life without giving a single interview. Still, it seemed clear she was a believer---her visits to the Ribbon had been confirmed, at the least.

Rika had done stories on the Ribbon before, and even visited herself once, in the course of due diligence. But perhaps she ought to look again.

She tapped her glass a few times against the table, then set it down, letting the robots get her another drink.

It was the Future, as Governance liked to say, but she was still a believer in old‐school journalism--some of the time anyway. She would send one of her girls on a stakeout, for a few days at a minimum, to get a real sense of the Ribbon and the magical girls reaching out to it.

Who knows what she might find?

The first place Lush‐Botanist suggested Ryouko visit was, naturally enough, her shipboard oasis.

There Ryouko found herself stepping into a wave of painfully hot air, and it took her a moment to realize that there was an actual wind, a sideways blast that dehydrated and seared her skin.

She blinked at that strange wind, squinting out over scorched rock, thin sand, and human‐sized columns of rock, strewn against a haunting backdrop of almost painfully red light. Tattered pathways of pounded dirt led the way forward, with the sand kept scrupulously away from the door. Without the faint traces of holography in the background, it would have looked entirely like stepping onto an alien world.

Only after a few seconds did she notice the plants clinging tenuously to the landscape---or not so tenuously, she realized abruptly, once she began receiving a full information feed from the starship. They were everywhere*, mats of thin fibers covered with gossamer hairs, patches of blue‐green that appeared nearly black in the red light of the room, like splatters of oil on the rock.

*`μ·The plants in my oasis are collected from a planet whose star is entering its last phases of life—the increased temperature has nearly depleted the surface of moisture, and even these plants will not survive|ν·My apologies if the environmental conditions are outside your comfort zone|ξ·One of the upsides of adopting this body was the chance to cultivate these types of plants more intimately`*

The ship paused to allow Ryouko to lean over and peer at a patch next to her.

*`μ·Most of the plant species on that planet have adapted to float high in the atmosphere, where the water vapor has collected, but that is a nutrient‐starved existence, and I do not have the facilities onboard to maintain both phyla||`*

It wasn\'t her style of garden, Ryouko had to admit, but Asami would have---

A loud squawking noise interrupted her before she could think about it further, as she heard a door slide open.

*This animal is unfamiliar to us. What is it doing here? Is it a threat? It is too large to safely attack.*

Ryouko had spent so long speaking with the aliens that she was briefly flummoxed by the single‐threaded telepathy, whose source she didn\'t recognize.

Then what looked like a penguin stormed out from behind a nearby rock column, as tall as Ryouko\'s chest and patterned in black and white. It drew up near her, and squawked again, colorful feathers on its head rising nearly to Ryouko\'s face.

*`·Be calm, A1c654u⊃Feathered‐Defender, Shizuki Ryouko⊃??? is our guest, not a threat, and an intelligent creature`{.calibre Lush‐Botanist thought, to both Ryouko and the creature.

At the same time, the ship explained to Ryouko:

*`·Feathered‐Defender is a member of a partner species that coevolved mutualistically with us, aiding in hunting and agriculture|+·Consensus/Ahimsa‐extending prefers to extend the welfare of these species by including them in many of our activities`*

The animal reared its head up and peered at Ryouko with one eye, beak half‐open. Ryouko swore it looked skeptical.

Then it turned towards her and extended its flippers, flapping them wildly, almost causing her to recoil.

*I greet you,* it thought. *You are a very curious creature. I thought all intelligent creatures were Thinkers. Aren\'t you too small for intelligence?*

*`·No, she is sufficiently large`* the ship thought.

*I greet you as well,* Ryouko thought, politely ignoring the commentary on her size. *I am a visitor here. Lush‐Botanist was showing me the plants.*

She had the sense now that the animal\'s telepathy was somewhat artificial, as if something was translating for her. Presumably, it wasn\'t as well‐spoken as it seemed---not unlike with Human pets, she supposed.

*Ah, the plants,* the creature thought. *I do not understand why Lush‐Botanist cares about these inedible plants, but it is my responsibility to defend them. My greetings as well to Clarisse⊃???, who rides within you? That is also strange.*

*Ah, greetings!* Clarisse thought, handing it to Ryouko to relay. Humans also retain relationships with partner species. I would not have thought the Thinkers had equivalents, based on observations of Consensus/Thinker‐Preserving.*

*`·They do not prefer as we do`* Lush‐Botanist thought simply.

*Those are interesting appendages,* Feathered Defender thought, making a short beseeching noise as it reached its beak up towards Ryouko\'s head. Can I touch them?*

Ryouko jolted backwards, her hair coiling protectively.

The bird shrunk back, feathers falling.

*My apologies,* the bird thought, and with a tinge of what felt like genuine guilt. Did this species have emotions?

*You merely surprised me,* Ryouko thought. *Go ahead.*

She bent forward so the creature could rub its beak against her hair, then its feathers, and she couldn\'t help but think of someone else. To her surprise, she felt her eyes tearing up.

The bird stood back again, making a quiet murmuring noise as it tilted its head.

*I\'m alright,* Ryouko thought. *I am... just regretting my separation from my life‐partner. She must think I am dead.*

*Tell me you\'re doing alright, Asami,* she thought to herself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before, Asami had looked forward to the confinement of interstellar travel.

Why wouldn\'t she? It gave her and Ryouko time alone, with few distractions, in abundant safety. It could get a little boring, yes, without all the press of gravity or wormhole experiments, but finding ways to pass the time was easy.

Now, she struggled.

She stayed in her room, despite the fact that the ship was full of others on leave for Ryouko and Clarisse\'s funeral. There was Simona, who barely counted, Van Rossum, Patricia, and a number of those they had trained and fought with.

She appreciated the support, but she found herself spending the most time with Azrael, and with Eri and Elanis, who were now painfully unhappy bodyguards. She had always enjoyed Azrael\'s company, and the bodyguards had grown on her over time. They were kids, after all, and it was strangely soothing, watching their playful bickering and teasing.

She ate meals with them, sampled Elanis\'s baking experiments, and stared off into the virtual depths of space. Part of her wished she could get it all over with and just go disappear under her sheets somewhere, but alas, the attendants for the funeral would be streaming in from across Human space, and some would not arrive for over a week.

Which meant that even after they landed on Earth, she would be stuck for days with her family, with only a planned visit to the Ribbon to leaven the malaise.

\"I\'m really starting to get why you keep coming back here,\" Asami said, clutching her knees and staring out at the clouds of Azrael\'s erstwhile homeworld. \"It steals you away from things, and when you feel like it, you can just throw yourself out into a thermal.\"

The two of them were perched on the edge of one of Azrael\'s favorite balconies, which had in life been the outdoor seating area of an ice cream shop. The remains of those cones lay behind them, waiting for a drone to pass by.

\"If only it were under better circumstances,\" Azrael said, legs dangling over the side.

Asami could only shrug slightly.

\"I suppose now that your secret is out, people at least seem surprisingly positive on it. Maybe you can even talk Governance into letting you release videos.\"

\"Or even the sim itself,\" Azrael said, shaking her head. \"The truth is, I\'m not sure I *want* that kind of attention. A part of me definitely prefers the privacy. But I\'ve got to take advantage of the moment and give it a shot. I owe my homeworld at least that much.\"

Azrael leaned back onto her wings, letting her hair hang freely, braided with decorations Asami had never seen outside the VR sim.

\"I can\'t say I know what you\'re going through,\" Azrael said. \"Not exactly. But I\'ve lost parents, relatives, more than that.\"

Asami didn\'t respond, and Azrael took a moment to bring a wing forward, between them, picking at something with one hand. Asami couldn\'t help but be reminded of a bird preening.

\"I know you came out here to get away from people trying to give you advice,\" Azrael said. \"So I\'m not going to do that. I\'m just going to tell you how things have been for me.\"

She drew her wing back, so they could see each other.

\"I thought, in the beginning, that I would never be able to live again, that it would always be a weight on my soul. I was right, sort of, but what I learned is that time is oppressive. You never stay the same person, and in the end even the pain drains away. Now, that\'s what bothers me the most. Whatever you once had, however you once lived---it becomes just a memory. Or a VR sim, I suppose.\"

She gestured at the skies around her.

\"It hurt me to realize this, but after so long, this place isn\'t real to me anymore. Not in the way it used to be. It wasn\'t possible to lose myself here for long, even if I wanted to. It\'s a place I visit to take a break, remind myself of how things were, but it\'s not my home.\"

\"But I don\'t want it to be like that!\" Asami said, tears welling up unbidden. \"I don\'t want to just forget, and have it be some sad story I tell people. I know---I know it\'s going to happen whether I like it or not, but it\'s like... it\'s a disgrace.\"

Asami looked down at her feet.

\"How is it possible that with an eternity to live, we can still not have enough time? That\'s what I was terrified of, not being able to spend long enough with her, and it all came true. Less than a year. My birthday is coming up, and she won\'t be here, when she hasn\'t even been to *one*.\"

\"The universe doesn\'t care,\" Azrael said. \"It will just tick on and on regardless of what happens. It feels unjust, but from a detached perspective, we\'re lucky to have been given our moments at all.\"

She shook her head, her hair untangling one of its decorations.

\"And yet it\'s against our nature as magical girls to only take what has been given.\"

She stood up, her hair tying itself up for flight. The beam they were on was barely a foot wide, but she made standing there look natural.

Azrael looked at her for a second, and before Asami could protest, she jumped off the edge, falling out of sight into the swelling orange clouds.

Asami stared, feeling the prickle of the wings in her back flexing instinctively. Was she just going to sit here and feel sorry for herself?

So she vaulted off the edge, the moisture in her eyes catching in the air for a moment before her nictating membranes sealed shut. For long seconds she was falling, a sensation she knew well from her time in space. Comforting, even.

Then she let her wings catch the air.

Even now, she couldn\'t forget. They had done this together before, and she could remember grabbing Ryouko by the hand and diving through the air together, Asami yelling manically as Ryouko looked on in that cutely puzzled way she had.

What did she have now?

Still, she flew, letting the simulated muscle memory take her up and around a nearby spire, catching a thermal as she went.

How simple life had once been for Azrael, she thought. How simple it could have been for all of them. Azrael\'s people had destroyed themselves---was that better or worse than having a peaceful life torn away by genocidal aliens?

Worse, Asami admitted. At least with the aliens, she had a target for revenge.

Or was it better to have a target you could actually reach? The aliens were unaccountable, unreachable, and possibly amoral. Perhaps Simona was right---perhaps the better targets were those humans who held their fates in their hands, and still traded away their lives.

Her thoughts spiraled onward like that, cycling in and out of empty topics that seemed to go nowhere, until finally Azrael landed on a high spire, a spiral tip where a winged statue gazed out from a patch of wind‐blown lichens toward the empty skies.

She pulled in for a landing too, letting the subtle magnetic guidance of the platform reel her in. After all, her feet were still human, and not great for landings---a real sticking point among the radicals, according to Azrael.

\"If it came to it, would you help me look for Akemi Homura and those working with her?\" she asked as she landed, just as Azrael opened her mouth to say something about the statue.

\"Of course,\" Azrael said, \"though I can\'t promise I\'d go as far as you might like. Believe me, I too want to know what\'s going on, and I think we\'re hardly alone in that. Remember, I\'ve been looking for her for years.\"

She paused meaningfully, weighing her words.

\"Do you believe, like Simona, that she really is as powerful as all that? That she can plan out everything?\"

Asami knew where this question was going, and let out a sigh to show how she felt about it.

\"Maybe,\" she said. \"If not her, then the deity that backs her.\"

*The one who told me to stick with Ryouko,* she thought, with a twinge of pain. She had gone over what happened in the wormhole over and over. If only---

\"Right, about that,\" Azrael said. \"I\'ve been around you, and Ryouko, and even Patricia enough to know you all take that quite seriously. Akemi‐san did too. I hear you\'re visiting the Ribbon soon? Patricia mentioned it.\"

\"Right after we land,\" Asami said. \"I want to get it over with.\"

She waited to see what Azrael would say, whether she would express skepticism or quiz her, but instead Azrael turned back to the statue.

\"Our people didn\'t believe in gods or goddesses,\" she said. \"Our goal was only to live the life we wanted, as long as the universe allowed us to. But still, someone built this statue after we landed, and we held ceremonies here every Earth‐year. I guess it just felt like the thing to do.\"

Asami took a moment to look up at the sky. The local star peeked through the clouds, casting the area in perfect light. She wondered if the simulation kept the conditions permanently that way.

\"So only about twenty hours until we reach Earth, right?\" Azrael asked.

\"And then another six or so to get down to ground,\" Asami added, though that was hardly the salient detail.

\"Mind if I come to watch? I don\'t have much else to do on Earth anyway, and it\'s probably high time I learned what I could about Akemi‐san\'s Goddess.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Their arrival on Earth was routine, even with all the recent disasters in Earth orbit. Things had been cleaned up, all but one of the space elevators were online, and they had arrived far too late to be caught in any emergency traffic stoppage.

A sense of nervousness did pervade the orbital elevator complex, and Asami could sense a couple of media drones following her at a distance, particularly when she passed a giant wall panel dedicated to fallen heroes of the war. Despite herself, she couldn\'t help but stop and look.

She didn\'t acknowledge the curious stares they drew from some of the other travelers, and she was thankful when Azrael took the attention off her by showing off her wings---now packed quite visibly in her luggage---to a passing family. She was allowed to talk about it now, and seemed to be taking the opportunity, letting some of the kids touch the feathers. Asami was glad to see that none of the passerby seemed overly off‐put.

She had been skeptical of the decision to travel without face anonymizers, but Azrael had insisted for just this reason. She was glad it had worked out.

As they descended, Simona sat with her arms crossed, watching it all play out. There would be no chance of a breakout---Clarisse was holding her soul gem, and had given Governance her personal promise to break it if Simona tried anything. Asami couldn\'t say it was undeserved.

But she sensed the girl was, if anything, happier than usual. She supposed anything beat being confined to quarters, but suspected the cause lay elsewhere. Strangely, Simona\'s disciplinary fate remained to be seen---Governance hadn\'t even published her role in Ryouko\'s death. Asami\'s TacComp had said that bode well for Simona, much to her chagrin.

And besides that, it was clear that Simona was looking forward to seeing what came of their little Ribbon visit. All the more reason for Asami to want to get it over with, but there was still one final hurdle.

No matter how she felt about her parents, she couldn\'t just *avoid them, and she didn\'t, once they reached Singapore, where they were waiting for her.

There was a certain kind of numb pleasure in just letting her parents coo and hug her, even if they had no understanding of what she was going through. It was like falling asleep exhausted on the first bed you encountered. Did it really matter if the sheets were how you preferred them? At the moment, her memories of her parents pre‐wish were distant indeed.

They filled her scramjet ride with frivolous chatter, and when she finally arrived back in Mitakihara, they took their leave, as she had requested, so that she might immediately head through the transport tubes towards her very first destination on Earth.

Visiting the Ribbon was a very different experience this time around.

A drone scanned them as soon as they stepped out of their vehicle, hovering at eye level on a pair of insect wings, before proceeding onward. That was followed by a not‐so‐subtle once‐over by a pair of magical girls stationed at the underground exit, who were at least nice enough to be apologetic about it---and both of them clearly recognized Asami and Clarisse van Rossum on sight. They stopped just short of applying serious mind‐reading.

Asami bore this last leg of her journey with a kind of nervous resignation. Nervous, because before her was an appointment with the Goddess, and perhaps Ryouko and a bleak truth---or perhaps nothing at all, and an even bleaker emptiness.

Resignation, because there was nothing further she could do to deal with those feelings, or to even make things happen any faster. They rose slowly to surface level on an elevator. The sun beat down upon them and the ruins, heat searing her skin, Simona wearing an infuriatingly pleased expression, drones buzzing back and forth---and it all meant exactly nothing.

There were only a few approved entrances through the security cordon, electronic and optically marked routes laying out safe, cleared pathways within the rubble. Most of the really dangerous or distressing sights from the news---massive chunks of unstable permacrete, exposed wiring, piles of disassembled clones---had been long since removed, but the disaster still hung in the air. The cleanup process was greatly slowed by the need to comb over everything for even minute pieces of evidence, and there were still thousands of drones of various classes and a few dozen human personnel scurrying over the site, confirming and scanning and accessing.

It seemed more agreeable to Asami than the clean, unperturbed environments she had endured since the end of the pulsar mission.

The temporary structure that had been erected over the Ribbon was simple and utilitarian, a large white tent with deliberately visible surveillance equipment scattered about it. A few Cult members sat at a table in front, welcoming arrivals with drinks and cookies beneath a canopy. They, and some of the other pilgrims, stirred at their arrival.

\"Hello, Miss Van Rossum,\" one of them said in Standard, lightly reverent. \"It\'s great to see you here, after this terrible disaster. Of course, the Ribbon is unharmed, but thanks to the Goddess\'s grace, we were able to get everyone out in time.\"

Left unsaid was that the Ribbon itself was protected by a battlecruiser‐quality forcefield, Asami thought, but the point was still valid---she doubted anything would ever be allowed to hurt it.

\"These are your guests?\" the other girl asked, glancing pointedly at Asami. \"If you\'re in a hurry...\"

\"No need,\" Clarisse said. \"We\'ll wait in line with the others.\"

Asami cursed Clarisse silently. She *did* want to skip the line, and didn\'t feel any need to be polite about it.

Only then did Asami notice the girl standing slightly off to the side, behind the small crowd. She looked just a bit out of place, and while there was no visible recording equipment, a media badge hung around her neck.

She reacted when Asami looked over, gesturing towards her.

*\"Our consolations to you in this dire time,\"* she transmitted. "I\'m with Mihama media group, an MSY‐internal organization. If there\'s anything you\'d like to say to the public at this time, I\'d be indebted for a few words before, or after this visit. Or perhaps with your companion.\"*

Asami shook her head. Not until afterward, if at all.

She watched Azrael peer in the reporter\'s direction. Given her recent openness to the media, was Azrael scheduling something?

\"Hey, you!\" Simona said. \"Here\'s news for you! Shizuki Ryouko is still alive, and I\'m here to prove it to her!\"

Far too late, Azrael jerked Simona by the arm, painfully hard, causing her to stumble towards the main entryway, where a final shove got her through.

Asami knew her face was bright red, and darted across the threshold immediately. Goddess, she wanted to punch Simona, and only the awareness that she still had an audience stopped her.

The other Cult members within the tent stared at them curiously, including the quartet of hatted guards around the Ribbon itself. They had all heard, of course.

The anger and embarrassment at least kept the anxiety away.

Asami kept her face down, glaring daggers at Simona. The line was short, at least, thanks to a recently‐instituted appointment system. Rows of pew‐like seats had been erected on both sides for observers, and Eri and Elanis took seats on the right, crossing their legs as they tried to feign nonchalance.

Asami sensed something approaching her back and jumped, almost yelping, when the local Incubator, Kyubey, hopped onto her shoulder.

*I\'m here to observe,* it thought on wideband as the chatter among the crowd grew even louder.

*Observe* what? Asami thought acridly.

*Anything,* Kyubey thought, before switching to address only Asami. *We have long thought Akemi Homura dead, but there is now irrefutable evidence to the contrary. Nor is she alone in evading our detection. Our comprehension of the world is flawed, and must be corrected.*

Asami gritted her teeth, but left it at that. Kyubey did not elaborate further.

She chewed over the Incubator\'s behavior silently as the line advanced, group after group adopting prayer poses for a couple minutes before standing up, most of them glancing back at her, then heading over to the rows of seats, staying just a bit longer. What would she tell them when it was all over?

And then they were there, the Incubator leaning into her face as she stared at the simple loop of red in its case. On a whim, she scanned the other electromagnetic frequencies: it looked normal, of course.

The others around her closed their eyes and clasped hands, so she did the same, transforming as she did so.

She snapped her eyes open when the light hit her, a scorching sensation in her skin from radiation‐sensitive nerve‐endings, fading once she paid attention to it. She turned towards the source, automatically looking off‐center to protect her eyes.

The sight was astonishing, breathtaking, ridiculous. The entire sky glowed fiercely, transitioning from near‐infrared at the far edges, to brilliant colors of visual and ultraviolet, to painful x‐rays and even gamma rays near the source. That was what had triggered her radiation alarms---should have done far more, in fact. She shouldn\'t have been able to stand here unharmed.

Closer inspection revealed swirling bright points of light plowing slowly and erratically through what she decided had to be some kind of nebula.

No, not just a nebula. It was far too dense, and though she had difficulty believing it, she could sense the immense source of gravity right above her, where the radiation was strongest, in the pitch‐black eye of the hurricane.

It was a black hole, and a tremendously large one at that. It looked three times as large as the sun in the sky, and based on the gravity around her...

She wasn\'t sure how she still had access to her magic, but it told her the black hole must be supermassive. Indeed, the vision reminded her of Sagittarius A☆, at the center of the Milky Way, as she had seen it upon the ceilings of the catacombs of Paris. It brought back memories of Ryouko, captivated, explaining to her---

Though she had been anticipating a vision of some kind, Asami still felt a pale shock, one that didn\'t fade as she turned to look around her. The landscape she was standing on was stark blank rock, scorched by radiation over geologic time, reflecting light across the spectrum. That eerie light gave the shadows on the landscape a spectral quality, glowing softly underneath monolithic pillars of stone.

Those shadows made her eyes catch on something distinctly out of place, just barely in sight.

She knew where she needed to go, then, and began making her way towards the anomaly, moving in slow, bounding steps that fell silently across the airless void.

A jagged silhouette, incongruous in its symmetry among the irregular pillars of smooth rock, resolved slowly into a winged statue---an artifact of purposeful hands rather than epochs of planetary geology. Blank, gray eyes transfixed hers, and it took Asami some time to place where she had seen that face before: the peak of the spiral spire, in Azrael\'s simulation.

When she finally landed before the graven rock, it seemed to shift in response, hair and wings swaying ever‐so‐slightly.

\"Don\'t toy around with me,\" Asami said, grabbing the statue\'s arm. "You know why I\'m here.\"

The statue turned away from her, shockingly fast, and before she could react the statue\'s arm jerked upward, pointing towards...

She shouldn\'t have been able to see it so quickly, the tiny object arcing overhead, carefully outside the debris disk, far further away than she should have been able to discern.

\"An alien vessel?\" she asked, a second before sensing---

Before sensing---

*Ryouko.*

It wasn\'t possible, but aboard was *Ryouko\'s soul*, she could feel that it was her, in complete certainty. It *had* to be her. And that meant---

*Yes, Simona is right,* the statue thought. *Ryouko is alive, and well.*

Asami collapsed, slowly, to her knees, the low gravity cushioning her fall. For long seconds she just stared, as incoherent feelings flooded through her: relief, joy, fear, longing, bewilderment, frustration, love.

Then she realized: What was she doing just kneeling there? She was wasting her chance!

She stood up then upon the desolation, and began to run.

Faster and faster she went, and with the final bound she surged as high as she could, summoning her gravity magic to gain impossible height. Irrational---but what was rational about any of this?

Yet, even as she climbed higher and higher, the alien ship in the distance grew no closer---indeed, it only shrank further away, towards the flaming wheel in the sky.

Of course it wouldn\'t work.

\"I couldn\'t go with her, then?\" she asked aloud. \"You had to separate us? You asked me to *protect her*!\"

Her voice had risen more than she had intended it to.

The statue didn\'t seem bothered, as it rose up in front of her again, stony wings calmly beating, tinged with a white glow from the disk beyond, directly in front of the supermassive black hole.

*I don\'t control everything, Asami,* it thought. *Your decisions, and Ryouko\'s, were your own. I preserved the life she sacrificed, ensuring contact with a gentler set of Cephalopods, but interfered no further. There were other possibilities, some not even involving the pulsar mission, where you went with her---but that was not how your body of choices played out.*

It took Asami a moment to understand, and then she just stared, mouth working wordlessly. What did you even *say* to that?

\"So it\'s my fault after all, then?\" she said. \"There was a way.\"

And yet, the despair that should have attended such a thought never came.

As she stared, she began to comprehend a strangeness in the face of the statue. The unmoving mouth and eyes... it was as if they weren\'t really there at all, as if there was a light, just behind them. Not the cold, harsh radiation of Sagittarius\'s disk, but something warmer, softer, more welcoming...

Asami clenched her eyes shut, mastering herself with an effort.

When she opened her eyes again, the statue was pointing at the inner edge of the accretion disk, on the far side of the black hole, shifted above it visually by the gravitational lensing. Suddenly, she spotted the alien ship again, close enough to the black hole that she would fear for its safety... except that it seemed protected somehow, cushioned in a bubble of empty space.

She didn\'t care to question what had happened, or how much time had passed; she could feel Ryouko\'s soul again.

Suddenly, she could see something new, shimmering outside the glowing debris, dwarfing the ship in scale. It was a giant ring, more in three dimensions than two, and there was no way she should have missed it until now.

Now that she was allowed to see it, there was a whole *complex* of installations centered around the ring, refueling and resupply facilities and other orbs of esoteric purpose. Each individual facility would have dwarfed the largest of Humanity\'s space stations, a dozen battlecruisers in length or more, and the whole system was nearly as large as Earth\'s moon, though filled with empty space, centered on a tremendous distortion in the center, one she *felt*, one that seemed to project stars onto the black hole\'s surface.

And around it, she seemed to see even *more* facilities in construction, shapes she was more familiar with, foundries which even seemed to have a carrier half‐assembled, defensive emplacements---but why were they only being built now?

Ryouko headed straight towards the distortion, which began to spiral open.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Alright, you wanted time alone to talk, what is it?* Ryouko asked, stepping back into her room on board the alien ship.

Obviously, they didn't *need* to be alone to talk, but it made it easier to focus, and she could use a bit of an escape anyway.

*I wanted to take a break to just stop and think,* Clarisse thought, it's very easy to get swept up in the flow of things, but for a situation like this, it's critical to maintain agency. That's part of what I've been programmed to do, sort through information in the background when your main attention is too busy, and then present it so that you can make informed decisions.*

*Okay,* Ryouko echoed emptily, dropping down onto her cushioned‐waterbed‐thing. *I'll admit, I've been a little too overwhelmed to think about the implications of hanging out with Cephalopods. And a Cephalopod uploaded into a starship. And his noisy penguin pet. With emotions.*

It had taken quite an effort to stop Feathered‐Defender from following her into her room. The bird seemed fascinated by Ryouko and Clarisse's novelty, and thrilled to have people to speak with that also engaged in linear thought and emotion. In the end, they had been forced to schedule a time to reunite with the creature.

*Right, and there's plenty to think about there,* Clarisse thought. *But before we engage in that, I've been looking at some of the less obvious angles---going over your past memories, Governance records that you have on hand, trying to see if the aliens' story checks out and what conclusions there are to draw. I've come up with some troubling thoughts about the alien faction prosecuting the war, Consensus/Thinker‐preserving.*

*I'm listening,* Ryouko thought, putting her hands behind her head to stare up at the ceiling, a dome‐like structure she had asked to display a pale shade of blue.

*Well, just before we ended up stuck here, Sakura Kyouko and some of her friends were engaged in an incident where they were attacked by a group of aliens at an asteroid. We are very lucky to have any details of that at all---we wouldn't know anything if Chitose Yuma hadn't told us.*

*That whole thing still confuses me,* Ryouko thought, *but at least the idea of a group of aliens trying to conduct diplomacy seems a lot more sensible now. Now that I think about it, I wonder if those alien diplomats were from /Ahimsa‐extending, or perhaps some other faction. It might be worth asking.*

*It might,* Clarisse agreed. *Once we're sure what we're dealing with. But there's more to it than that. Review the files; they found a group of aliens on one of the attacking ships who appeared to be sensitive to demon attacks. They didn't have time to resolve the mysteries of the situation, but after what we've heard here, the implications could be tremendous. If the faction fighting the war has gained emotions while in the Milky Way somehow, that would go a long way toward explaining why their behavior has been so unpredictable.*

That unexpected chain of thought took much longer to untangle, and she even closed her eyes for a moment to think about it.

*That's worrying,* Ryouko thought finally. *Though there's hardly much in the way of evidence to go on. Plus, how and why?*

*I don't know,* Clarisse thought. *I can only speculate. But from what I understand, corruption of the preference‐specification system is as bad for them as breaking the TCF is for us. Among other things, no one is even supposed to* want to*. That's supposed to be provable.*

*So should we tell them?* Ryouko thought. *It seems like the nice thing to do, but---*

*Right, the situation isn't about being nice or not,* Clarisse thought, agreeing with her before she could even finish the thought. *It's about what's best for Humanity. Given that, I don't know that we want to tell them. Do we trust them? Would we want to help them even if we did? The question is too loaded to analyze, for now.*

*We might have to wait and find out more,* Ryouko thought, making an unhappy noise. *That's uncertainty I don't like.*

Moreover, it felt a bit rude, a feeling she knew was illogical.

*There are other reasons to be cautious,* Clarisse thought. *Do you remember the blink interdictors we encountered at the pulsar?*

*How could I forget?*

*I'm inclined to think those* weren't *deployed by /Thinker‐preserving. Azrael said that the Ceph using the device we found were also using stealth to hide from the other Ceph in the mines. But if not Thinker‐preserving, then whom? It seemed awfully targeted, didn't it? But there's only one group we know expected you to be there.*

*It seems a bit strong of an inference to think these 'Ahimsa‐extending' were behind it,* Ryouko thought. *What, were they trying to capture me? What would be the point, if they knew where I would end up?*

*I don't know. But it's very strange that we found a telepathic packet explaining *that they had used a blink interdictor. Explaining pretty much only to you.*

Ryouko made a face, which she assumed the alien surveillance wouldn't be able to interpret.

*More echoes of Akemi Homura, perhaps.*

*Perhaps. But it seems we're out of time, for now.*

Lush‐Botanist was calling them to the ship's engine room. There was something time‐sensitive they wanted her to see.

Ryouko pulled herself up using one of the poles around her bedding, and strode purposefully out the door.

By this point she needed no direction, and veered past the medbay to the open doorway that led to the engine core. The closer she got, the brighter her soul gem glowed.

As she stepped to the threshold of the walkway that led to the core itself, an elegant spheroid suspended in its chamber, the ship addressed her:

*`μ·We are approaching the central galactic black hole, our pathway to Andromeda|μ+·You had requested to be present for transit events|ν·Apologies for interrupting your rest, but there is important information to convey`*

Before she could ask what the ship meant, she felt an incoming telepathic request---the ship was asking to share visual data.

When she assented, the room faded into the background, overlaid with a vision that left her dazzled---the stars and nebulae of the galactic core laid out across her field of vision, not just visible but labeled and cataloged, a deluge of information across her mind that even Clarisse struggled with.

Then the chaos pulled away, the telepathic link pulling her towards the object directly in front of them, approaching rapidly.

While the core was invisible in the EM spectrum, Sagittarius A☆ was positively luminescent in every other way, whether it be the multi‐solar‐system‐sized accretion disc that glowed burning hot, or the massive gravitational signature, or the effect it had on her soul gem. Regardless, the readouts made clear that the surrounding space was occupied, by an enormous wormhole stabilizer and all that accompanied it.

The ship answered the first questions that came to her mind.

*`μ·As an inspection ship we have right‐of‐transit here|μ+·We are not declaring you as a passenger|ν·I strongly advise refraining from any reality‐warping activities for now, to avoid detection|ξ·Your species' attack on the pulsar space‐time evulser has forced them to construct more defensive emplacements`*

Ryouko immediately clamped down on her soul gem emissions.

*\|\|ν?·Is that really a possibility\|* she thought.

*`||ν·Yes‒6%, if /Thinker‐preserving has developed improved reality‐distortion detection technology|`*

*If they really had that kind of technology, they would be better at detecting our MagOps,* Ryouko thought, keeping it to herself.

She still couldn't help but feel a bit anxious, but as she paced around the engine room, they decloaked and were scanned by a patrol ship without incident, a variety of sensors passing over the surface of their ship with a sensation that she felt as a slight tingle.

According to Lush‐Botanist, she had a secondary stealth module, not the usual kind used for war: more of a smuggling device, suitable for concealing the passage of an unusual species. She could sense Clarisse furiously taking intelligence notes on every passive sensory channel she had.

Perhaps just as interesting was the idea that the aliens would even have* a smuggling device, but as she had been learning, Cephalopod society was less totalitarian than she had expected---inter‐Tentacle agreements often allowed or assumed a certain degree of deception, especially if one side's core values were at stake.

*?∈·You said you are an inspection ship\|?∈·Does inspection refer to the pref‐spec‐verification you mentioned earlier* she asked.

The ship replied:

*`·Yes, though that is a functional status, not a description of my physical design|·Yes: both to confirm adherence to their binding‐preference‐alteration‐agreements with us, and to satisfy standard Consensus requirements upon /Thinker‐preserving`*

*\|?·You have agreements with /Thinker‐preserving*

*`|∈·Many, covering sundry matters—such pref‐arb is common|∈·Regarding the conflict with your species, we pay them considerable resources in exchange for observance of certain moral customs—for example, not taking any prisoners`*

Ryouko boggled. It made a twisted sense, if you assumed your opponent had uploaded backups of their population. Indefinite imprisonment was cruel compared to losing a short span of memory, as /Ahimsa‐extending had previously seen it.

*`|·Inspection has been difficult, however, and we have lost several of our inspection ships to Human attacks throughout the war, starting from the very beginning and most recently at the pulsar|+·Your testimony will be essential evidence in proving the fraud against us we have long suspected`*

*Ah, a more practical reason that they care,* Clarisse thought.

Ryouko chewed on those words, as the black hole loomed larger and larger before them. It tugged at her, a sensation similar to Asami preparing a singularity, and the pulsar mines.

She did her best to swallow the sensation. Not now.

It wasn't the black hole that held her attention now, but the circle of stars that loomed in front. Against the total darkness of the event horizon, it looked like a window to the stars.

Which it was, quite literally.

She was close enough to see the edges of the sphere pulsing, the ship's core pulsing with it, and she could feel her soul gem trying to pulse in turn--though she was doing all she could to keep the light from streaming out.

At the same time, another thought had occurred to her:

She was going where no human had ever gone before. Was this not her wish?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*So, did Nakihara‐san* really *say that she was shown Shizuki‐san was still alive?* Mami asked. *I know Chiyo‐san does her best, but the media can get a bit hyperbolic.*

Yuma watched Kyouko react uncomfortably. She would have thought Kyouko was *behind* the stories in the MSY media about Nakihara Asami, but her reaction suggested otherwise. And Yuma considered herself *very good* at reading Kyouko.

It was relieving, actually. She really didn't want to tell Arisu that Kyouko was having trouble accepting the death of her, and *Mami's*, mentee.

*She did, and I believe her,* Kyouko replied finally, giving Yuma a narrow‐eyed look. *She said some other things too.*

Yuma winced inwardly.

She checked Mami's face. Instead of reacting with polite skepticism, or the careful neutrality Yuma displayed herself, Mami appeared thoughtful, even accepting. Just how much had they gotten to her?

*Well let's hear it then,* Mami thought, glancing back at Yuma. *The details might be interesting.*

Kyouko seemed reluctant to speak, almost like she was embarrassed.

And embarrassed she might well have been, given the spiel she then relayed, avoiding Yuma's gaze the whole time. Asami claimed that Ryouko had made contact with some sort of "gentler" Cephalopods, and was, apparently, already cruising along with them through wormholes at the center of the Milky Way.

She had never heard a more fantastic set of claims, but there was a disturbing element to it: intelligence about a less genocidal group of aliens *did* exist, in the form of the recordings from the asteroid mission, but was classified beyond Asami's reach. How then did she know about that?

It might have lent credibility to her claim, but as Yuma looked around at the others---Kyouko and Mami nodding along like they were discussing vital intelligence---it seemed all too possible that she had simply been told, or the information otherwise leaked. She would have expected more from her friends, but who knew what influence they were under?

No, she was overthinking it. Shizuki Ryouko knew about it, so did everyone with her at the pulsar when Yuma had sent the data. It would make perfect sense for Asami to know about.

She was grateful for that; the other possibilities were too unpleasant. She had contingency plans---Mami's role in the military was too powerful to ignore the risk of compromise---but she preferred not to think in such directions.

She gathered herself. For now she had to focus on the threat in front of her---the mysterious Ribbon.

It had been moved out of its previous location---an unceremonious tent---while the Cult worked on reconstruction. Ostensibly, they wanted to build the old church back up again as soon as practicable, but the move also provided a convenient excuse for Kyouko to briefly close off access. The Cult had seemingly been very cooperative, even allowing Yuma to help design the interim Ribbon hall.

Yuma had set both mundane and magical equipment in place to examine the Ribbon, and was straining herself to detect what magic she could on it. Thus far, there had been nothing.

She still felt trepidation. She had always shunned coming here, worried about lending credence to Kyouko's beliefs, and about what the trip might do to her. It was a fear that, in retrospect, made little sense. If the Ribbon were truly that dangerous, what had she been doing letting it lie at the heart of the MSY for twenty years? Her actions were inconsistent.

*Had been.* Now Mami had gotten sucked into all this. That made all fears more justified, but it was only proper that she finally trust in her friends' abilities and at least take a look at the thing.

After plenty of screening.

*I know what you're thinking, Yuma‐chan,* Mami thought, scrutinizing Yuma's face. *But I'm not crazy. Just take my word on that. Come on.*

They both knew just those words wouldn't be enough, but she stepped forward into the room anyway, keeping her metaphorical eyes peeled for any sign of trouble.

She found it immediately, the familiar white‐and‐red form of an Incubator resting on the transparent case containing the Ribbon, bypassing all of the shielding that Yuma knew to be there.

Yuma's eyes darted around the hall, searching for any suspicious traces, magic or otherwise. There were a few rows of old‐fashioned, uncomfortable‐looking pews, with plain wood paneling that Kyouko had insisted on, and Yuma's large, obtrusive metal surveillance equipment, glimmering with enchantment---but nothing that shouldn't have been there.

Kyubey jumped to the floor, passing effortlessly through the shielding.

*I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to see you here,* Yuma thought, as it moved in front of her feet, forcing Yuma to step around it as she approached the Ribbon.

*It is useful to check in at times,* the Incubator thought. *Both on this artifact, and on* you. *My ability to predict you three's behavior has been waning of late, and I do not wish to lose valuable contractees. But, I'm sure you've been scolded plenty.*

It rubbed at its ear with a paw, one of the many mannerisms it had presumably copied from cats.

*As for the artifact, well---who knows what you will see?*

Yuma wondered at the strange comments---and then the world shifted.

In the literal blink of an eye she found herself outdoors, the glare of the sun pricking at her eyes.

She should have jumped immediately, evading faster than possible whatever force or magic had surprised her. Her magic should have ensured it---and if not that, her human side should have jumped in startlement.

Instead, nothing, which she found incredible even as she stood there, blinking.

Regardless of what she thought of the Ribbon, the immediate conclusion was obvious. Still, she exercised diligence, scanning everything about her surroundings as rapidly as possible: no, there was no sign of any teleportation magic or otherwise that had been applied to her, and yes, she was completely cut off from the network, and all telepathic connections, including the connections she had been maintaining to MG and Atsuko Arisu. In fact, all one hundred percent of her consciousness was present and centralized, which shouldn't have been possible without her volition.

She also recognized where she was. These were the rooftops of old Mitakihara, the one of her childhood. She had run these routes often, with both of her childhood teams.

Though the exact place she was standing... she had rarely ever seen it from this angle. Here, next to a billboard that was usually a political ad, on top of a popular cake shop Yuma had often ogled from a distance---

It was the first place she had ever seen Mami, Homura, and Kyouko.

That meant...

She looked up, past the political billboard, towards the roof of the dance club across the street. There a woman stood, in a giant white dress---not the least practical costume Yuma had ever seen, but it didn't miss by much.

The woman waved, and it seemed to Yuma that she was looking at an optical illusion---her mind insisted that the hair just kept going and going*, but somehow it didn't seem to block anything. And she couldn't focus on the face.

She had learned as much as she could from just observing, she decided.

"I take it you're this Goddess I've heard so much about," she said, projecting her voice across the gap. "Don't just nod along. I want to hear you say it."

"I am the Goddess, yes," the woman said, in a pleasant voice that carried suspiciously well. "Well, that's what they call me. I haven't really argued it, since it's a reasonable way to interpret things. I would keep going, but you don't really want to chat with me, right?"

Yuma did her best to conceal her reaction, both externally and internally---she had a carefully prepared plan for the scenario she found herself in, and one of the key points was to limit how much the "Goddess" could manipulate her---or "chat", in her words.

"I want you to prove to me that you really can predict the future," Yuma said, sticking to her memorized lines. "I'm not ordering you around, of course, but I think if you can prove yourself to me we'll be more useful to each other."

"I really prefer the more conversational approach," the woman said, sounding genuinely disappointed.

Sparkles of light fell off her towards the ground. Yuma... didn't think they were meant to represent tears. It didn't matter---she wouldn't budge.

"But I do understand," the woman continued. "You know all too well how dangerous someone with future‐sight can be."

That would have to count as an acceptance, Yuma thought.

"First, I want you to verify that you're not Mikuni Oriko, nor some surviving plot of hers," she said.

"She'll be overjoyed to hear you still think so highly of her," the woman said, "that such a possibility is yet worth ruling out. No, I am not."

Indirectly verifying Mami's claim to have spoken to Oriko, assuming any of this could be trusted, Yuma thought, before she could suppress it.

She couldn't let her mind be led off‐track. It was tempting, so tempting to accept this entity's friendly overtures, but there was no way she could trust apparent emotional cues under the circumstances.

The other woman brushed at her robes with one gloved hand, creating another distracting shower of light.

"Alright, well in that case," Yuma said finally, "to probe exactly what kind of future‐sight or clairvoyance you possess, if any, I've arranged for a set of particle physics experiments to be performed before, during, and after my visit to your Ribbon. The results should exhibit pure quantum randomness, so no one should be able to predict the results, not to mention the experimental noise on top of that. Would you please provide the results of these experiments?"

The woman closed her eyes, smiling vaguely---or, that was the impression Yuma got, despite being unable to see her face properly.

"In all this time, I've never had anyone ask for anything so abstract, nor so loaded with physical implication. But even though I know you've thought about that, you ask for a lot more than you know, and I'm not going to say I'm happy about it."

She paused, making sure Yuma absorbed those words, before continuing:

"However, if we're going to do this, let me suggest an approach to you. I can provide much more detailed data than you have asked for, and I have the power to *ensure* that you remember what I say, no matter what. What do you think?"

Yuma found herself at a slight loss. She had contrived for the interpreted experimental results to be easy to remember even without implant support, a list of binary and categorical answers. She hadn't anticipated a scenario like this. She was *supposed* to ignore all unnecessary proposals, but...

"If I decline?" she asked, tersely.

"Then I read out the simplified results to you, like you planned," the woman said.

The easy answer was no, Yuma knew. But the truth was, she *was interested in learning if the woman---the entity---could do what she claimed. The experimental design didn't depend on Yuma remaining uncompromised---a wise precaution, considering that this "vision" apparently involved having her senses hijacked and her consciousness captured.

"I accept," Yuma said.

Yuma heard the voice in her head then; the woman wasn't even moving her lips. What she found imprinting itself on her mind was indeed elaborate, with full numerical precision and details. And though it shouldn't have been possible, she could remember every last digit.

Yuma did her best to hide her surprise, keeping her face straight and focusing on her surroundings for a moment---the fluffy clouds, the smell of the bakery and fuel exhaust below. She realized that it wasn't the full spectrum smell gifted to her by her military‐grade implants---it was the smell of memory, how it had smelled to her as a child.

No, it was better than mere memory.

"I have also set up an unrelated test," Yuma said eventually, returning to her script. "I have asked various individuals I am working with to generate a set of secret code phrases, and would like you to tell me what these phrases are. If needed, I can tell you who they are or just how many there are."

"No need," the woman said instantly. "Here you go."

She repeated the previous feat, words imprinting themselves on Yuma's mind.

The woman was unnervingly confident, and Yuma could feel the doubt creep into her mind---not doubt in the woman, but doubt in *herself*. She had prepared practically for the scenario where the "Goddess" was everything Kyouko promised, but she was starting to realize she hadn't prepared emotionally*. The implications were massive.

She could still remember Homura telling her about the afterlife, when she was young and talk like that made her feel better, whether she believed it or not. She had thought she had left such things behind her.

Yuma clamped down on her thoughts then, aware she had leaked so, so much to any mind‐reader who might have breached her defenses. As this woman obviously had.

There was only one more test, perhaps the most creative one. There was a magical girl she trusted, Rose‐Merline Béliar, who claimed to be able to talk to furniture. Yuma had asked her to talk to a particular set of lava lamps in the near future, asking them about trivia. In principle, their responses would not only be unpredictable---they'd be a product of magic*.

"Surprisingly sage replies for novelty furniture, if rather off‐topic," the woman said, once the final answers were delivered. "Now, if we've taken care of business, I'd be glad to host you a while longer. Surely you can stay around a bit; I can transition us somewhere nice?"

"I'd like to leave," Yuma said, shaking her head more forcefully than she'd intended. She had never had any intention of staying longer than she had to, and doubly so now---not until she had her thoughts sorted out.

The woman waved, as Yuma's vision started to fade.

"Bye bye then. I do appreciate you showing up for my birthday parties!"

Yuma was left with the smell of cake in her nostrils.

The others around her hadn't reacted yet---Kyouko in particular still had her head down in prayer---and a quick check showed that her external connections, telepathic or otherwise, were back online, and her consciousness was back to being distributed exactly as it had been before---which again, shouldn't have been possible.

As tempting as it was to immediately send messages to everyone confirming their code words, she forbore. She needed to get out of the area and have herself aggressively screened first. The teams were already on standby.

She wouldn't lie to Mami and Kyouko, but ideally *that* conversation could be held afterward---at least until they were away from Kyubey, whose smug impression seemed to suggest he knew exactly what had happened.

As if reading her mind, Kyouko stood up, glanced at Yuma, and reached for the Incubator.

"Alright, you little snoop, get out of here," Kyouko said, picking the creature up by its front paws. "This is private business."

*How unpleasant,* Kyubey thought. *I would prefer to stay.*

Yuma watched as Kyouko physically tossed the protesting Incubator out the door, which slid shut a moment later. Sure, it might listen in, but the Incubators generally respected being thrown out of places.

Kyouko clapped her hands together.

*I can tell something happened,* she thought.

Yuma, who hadn't tried to hide anything, knew it was all over her face.

*I was hoping to wait,* she thought, sighing. *But since you got rid of Kyubey, yes, sure, I admit it.*

She took a moment to look over the others---Kyouko looked happy, almost eager, while Mami just looked relieved.

Then Yuma shrugged her shoulders, curling and uncurling the hair she was still keeping long.

*I prepared for this contingency,* she thought. *And had a battery of questions ready. After this, I'm going to go verify what I can. Here.*

Now that everything was over, it didn't hurt to share the protocol with Kyouko, so to speak, leaving out the actual questions and responses.

The girl snorted a moment later.

*I don't know how offended the Goddess was by all this, but I am offended* for *Her,* Kyouko thought. *I wouldn't like being interrogated by someone I'm trying to help.*

*I didn't get the impression that she would be bothered by that kind of thing,* Mami thought, shrugging. *Though I thought I got harsher treatment...*

*And that was all I did,* Yuma thought. *I asked her to keep it short. If all works out, I'll come back later.*

Kyouko's face scrunched up, and she opened her mouth to say something further, but they were interrupted by a scratching noise at the door.

*I do have more business with you three, if I'm not interrupting, Kyubey thought.

Kyouko and Yuma glanced at each other.

*It was nothing important,* Kyouko thought. *Let's see what the little snitch wants.*

The Incubator bounded into the room as soon as it slid open, settling into a slow walk.

*You threw me out before I could suggest it, but I was going to offer to go check if Shizuki Ryouko was really where Nakihara Asami claimed her to be,* Kyubey thought, coming to a stop in front of Mami.

*We never previously thought information from alleged visions very credible,* it continued, *but recent events have given us pause.*

*Where Nakihara Asami claimed her to be?* Kyouko asked, before either of the others could react. *That hasn't been reported anywhere. Just what have you been up to?*

*It was mentioned to me by Simona del Mago,* Kyubey thought, tilting its head. *After all, we are a party capable of rendering certain kinds of assistance.*

They took a moment to digest that, before Kyouko continued:

*What's stopping you then? Why are you even asking? I can't say I'm a fan of you getting involved in our business.*

*Indeed,* Kyubey thought, licking one of its paws. *That is one of the reasons for delay. I thought you would appreciate being asked. More importantly, though, performing this check would cost a meaningful amount of energy. If we were to report the result to you, we would want compensation.*

*Compensation, hm?* Mami echoed.

By this point they had been around the Incubators enough to know what they meant---but also that it was never wise to put words in an Incubator's mouth. They were all too happy to let you think you were right. Better to make them say it.

*Yes,* the Incubator acknowledged. *Both of us are well aware of the value of the information. In exchange, we would like access to whatever information you have on Akemi Homura and those who may be working with her.*

Yuma observed the surprise on the others' faces. It wasn't a completely unprecedented offer; ever since the MSY had shown itself to be an organization of value, the Incubators had made a great show of respecting their practices, or at least pretending to. On rare occasions, they made offers like this, trading something of small value in exchange for a peek at the MSY's secrets.

But it was usually small, so small that it was difficult to be certain if the Incubators really cared about either side of the deal, or were just putting up an act. For them to barter information of real value meant they might *really* care.

*It bothers you that Homura has been able to hide from you,* Yuma thought.

There was a lengthy pause before Kyubey replied.

*Yes, it bothers us,* it thought.

*Well, I might just have to give Homura some credit, then,* Yuma thought. *But snide comments aside, I think we can consider your offer. It's only fair that we take some time to review just what kind of information we'd be parting with.*

*Of course,* the Incubator said.

It sat down on the carpet, looking up at the three of them expectantly, before Kyouko picked it up again and headed for the door.

*I still don't think this called for,* it protested, as Kyouko set it down outside the door, gently this time.

Yuma waited a beat, taking the time to check on her arrangements. She had placed security teams around the site, with the job of screening the area for anyone, magical or not, trying to probe their location. Several sweeps had already come back clean, but she knew better than to trust that---the sweeps would continue for a while yet.

That reminded her that she had something else to talk about.

*Look, regardless of what comes of my experiments,* she began, turning towards Mami. *I have to warn you that your recent changes in military policy haven't gone unnoticed. Kuroi Kana already has her suspicions, and doubtless Governance does too. If anyone were to put the pieces together between* that *and your visits here...*

*I've thought of that,* Mami thought, cracking a slightly crooked smile. I haven't done anything I couldn't otherwise justify. It would be a problem if someone tried to draw the real connections, but it's all deniable.*

*I'm not sure about that---* Yuma began.

She paused, pointing at her ear to signal an urgent incoming call. The most recent security sweep had reported back.

*"We have a perimeter breach,"* one of her security teams sent.

Yuma froze in place, reaching a part of her mind out to assess the situation.

One of them had found something---no, someone---trying to conduct an active magical scan of the area. Was it possible after all that this "Goddess" was a fake?

That thought died the instant she heard the voice.

*"No, no, sorry!"* Chiyo Rika said, her voice coming through the comms. "You got me! Well played."*

Yuma released an audible groan.

*What is it?* Kyouko asked, nudging Yuma with an elbow.

Yuma sent her and Mami a rapid summary of the situation, and Kyouko echoed her groan seconds later.

*"Yes that's right, leave her be,"* Yuma transmitted. *"We'll deal with her separately."*

She could only imagine the grumbling that would cause, but Rika was special. Rika could make them pay for any overzealousness.

Not to mention, there had to be something else going on here. Rika had apparently chosen to surveil them *herself*---one of the only ways their security could have been broken---but that meant she *already* knew something was up. How?

At least they would have their chance to find out. Rika had already sent the meeting invite. She just hoped it wouldn't be too bad.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few hours later, they made their way to the meeting site, a nearby MSY location that Rika had chosen as neutral grounds.

Maison Yuno had been founded in 2130, during the height of the MSY's pre‐Unification War years. On the outside, it had been a standard posh, somewhat European‐style eatery, exclusive enough to feature known chefs and require connections to get in, but careful never to become *too notable.

On the inside, of course, it was an MSY hideaway, used to hold get‐togethers and meetings in a secure, deniable location, whenever a standard office building wouldn't have been appropriate and a working dinner or lunch *was*.

"You've had this place secured, I trust," Yuma asked, a moment after they stepped through the door of their private room.

"As have you," Rika said. "Not that anyone would dare. I have my connections here."

"But you checked anyway," Yuma said.

"But I checked anyway," Rika confirmed.

Yuma took a seat across from Rika, politely partaking of the fried yuca sticks already in place in front of her.

There was a further exchange of pleasantries---a passing of food, some courteous questions, Kyouko working her way rapidly through the yuca sticks---all while they read as much as they could off of each other, which frankly wasn't much. They had been political allies once, back when that had meant quite a bit---but that was centuries ago, and these were contentious days.

"Alright, Chiyo‐san, let's not drag this out," Mami said finally. "What's the meaning of you spying on us? How much did you see?"

Rika crossed her arms, meeting Mami's gaze.

Finally, Rika spoke.

"It's in the public interest to know what's going on with that Ribbon. You know that the perpetrators of the recent attacks posted claims online that the Ribbon is corrupting the core of the MSY leadership."

"Surely you don't believe that," Kyouko said, visibly, and deliberately, rolling her eyes.

"Of course not, but it's making waves in the more conspiratorial tendrils of the Grapevine, and it's spreading by word‐of‐mouth among the general public too. So it's in our interest to dispel what we can. There's only more buzz now after my story about Nakihara‐san. So, you can imagine what we thought when we heard Ribbon visitation was shut down for 'reconstruction', and my girl on‐site started reporting they couldn't breach the privacy screen."

There was so much that could be said to that, Yuma thought. The foremost of which was "How does that give you the right to breach the *privacy screen?" But the confrontational approach had never worked with Rika. Her views were her views, and you found a way to either work with her or fight with her. Her time as Speaker had only made that tendency worse.

And in this case, Rika had the strong hand. They all knew it.

"It is *precisely* because of the claims Nakihara‐san made that we are here," Mami said, closing her eyes for a moment. "You know I have never been one to put much stock into what comes out of the Cult, but have your sources told you about the details? Not just that Shizuki‐san is alive, but all the other critical information. About her making contact with a supposed alien faction, one that is perhaps interested in diplomacy? Such a thing could change the course of the war, if true. I had to see for myself."

One might think that Mami was being reckless, leaking so many details, but they had already agreed to say this much; they wouldn't mind reading about it in the news tomorrow, even if it raised questions about their ability to keep Governance secrets.

Plus, Rika *could* perhaps be convinced to keep the secret herself, and it gave them an avenue to gauge her reactions.

"That's why it had to be done quietly," Mami continued. "That, and the rumors you've been talking about. None of this information is certain, and if Yuma and I appeared to be putting our approval on what comes out of the Cult..."

She let her voice trail off there, assessing Rika's reaction. The woman's face had clouded at the mention of an alien faction, and she was clearly considering the matter. No Ancient was easy to read, but to Yuma it seemed Rika genuinely hadn't known, and was thinking hard about it.

That raised Yuma's optimism, just a little.

"Important information, if true," Rika said finally, putting a hand to her chin to make a pensive gesture. "But obviously only if true. I can certainly see why you held onto it. But what did you find out in the end? Do you put stock in it?"

It should have been very easy to lie. They had considered it: they could just say that they were seeing if there was anything to Kyouko's claims, and thus far they hadn't found anything. It wouldn't be *wholly convincing---why did *both* Mami and Yuma need to be there?---but it would be difficult to prove otherwise. From there it would just be a matter of convincing Rika not to run with the unverified information Mami had just discussed.

But if they lied and Rika knew it, it would alienate her---and frankly, she probably wouldn't believe the lie. Better to tell her at least some of the truth.

"We didn't receive any specific verification of Nakihara‐san's claims," Mami said. "But it's become clear to me that the Ribbon is a magical artifact of some potency. I wouldn't rule out its potential accuracy."

Rika sighed, rubbing her forearm with one hand.

"I appreciate the honesty, so I'll return some of my own. It'll save us time anyway. Your privacy screens were pretty good, but I've honed my clairvoyance more than you know. I only just managed to intercept anything*, but I did catch the fact that Mami‐san is concealing Ribbon influence on some of her decision‐making."

She turned her head away.

"To be clear, I don't like revealing personal information, particularly embarrassing information, just for the equivalent of a gossip column, but I think people have a right to know if the Chair of the General Staff is making decisions based on alleged Ribbon visions. *Especially given the recent allegations and conspiracy theories."

Just like that, the stakes became clear.

Mami didn't attempt to hide her dismay, which would have been pointless. Instead she crossed her arms and closed her eyes.

"As I said, the Ribbon has some clear potency, and yes, I have experienced what seemed to be a vision. Some of the information I received from that, and from a vision of Shizuki Ryouko's, has already proved credible. Nakihara‐san's claims about the Cephalopods are also more grounded than they sound, in light of other non‐public information derived from the recent incident near Yenisei. I could get you an off‐the‐record look---you would see that preparing for the possibility of communication with the Cephalopods is perfectly reasonable. In fact, I made that decision well before Nakihara‐san's vision, and independently from the Ribbon. The chain‐of‐inference on that is a matter of official record."

"I am here because I agreed to help test the magical qualities of the Ribbon," Yuma said, making sure Mami didn't sink alone. "That is what all the equipment is about, if you saw that. While I believed what Mami‐san said, we agreed it would be useful to make sure everything checks out. I should even be able to measure the accuracy of some predictions."

In fact, most of those predictions had already been verified, pending only a few particle physics experiments that were still being performed. But she certainly wasn't going to reveal that to Rika just yet---better if she thought they still needed time.

As for the implications thereof... it seemed Homura was more sane than she had ever thought.

"It's not like they're members of the Church or anything," Kyouko complained, completing the trio. "If anything, they don't give the Goddess anywhere near enough respect."

"What are you afraid of?" Rika asked, almost before Kyouko finished speaking. "You can guess what my position is, but if I understood what exactly the concern was, I might be able to help ameliorate things. Just implying to me my story might be bad for the MSY isn't going to cut it."

"We've discussed some of the implications amongst ourselves," Yuma said. "We're not ready for public disclosure. If this is made public, the ideas and rumors it would start might be a tidal wave, and all we'd have to counter with is Mami‐san's word and a few of my measurements."

"As I said, I've done little that would be unreasonable given existing evidence," Mami said. "But appearances matter. My position on the General Staff is crucial for the credibility of the MSY as a whole. We have expended a great deal of effort building relationships and trust with the military and Governance, and I wouldn't want it thrown away."

Rika pursed her lips, taking a moment to think.

"I understand," she said. "But if the issue is one of managing the implications and maintaining trust, then I don't think this is so serious it cannot be managed with a bit of planning. You mentioned taking measurements, Chitose‐san?"

"Yes," Yuma answered. "I have a few teams working on it, as you saw, as well as some magical and mundane instrumentation. That still needs some more time to fully work out. It'd be a lot of detail to go into, but..."

"I would want to know at least some of the details, yes," Rika said, anticipating the point.

She took a breath.

"Look, I don't want to seem unreasonable. I haven't heard enough to make me want to keep your secret, but I'm not going to dump this on you wantonly. I'll hold on to it for a week, make sure you get to say your piece in the story, and be sympathetic. If you want to disclose everything yourself or hold a press conference, we can coordinate timing, as long as you don't preempt me."

It *was* a reasonable offer, provided they accepted the fundamental concession Rika was proposing, of abandoning secrecy.

"Give us a moment," Yuma said, tilting her head toward the others to signal they needed to confer.

*We would have had to go public about it at some point anyway,* Mami thought, without turning her head.

*I know, but in a week? I would have preferred a year,* Yuma thought. As I said earlier, I want the situation to calm down a bit first.*

*It could be worse. I still think it would be better to drop this news while everyone is still shocked from the TCF breach and everything else going on,* Mami thought.

*We don't need another PR hit after the clones thing,* Yuma thought. Governance might use this to distract from the TCF breach.*

*And we can make sure that doesn't happen,* Mami thought. *A week is plenty of time to negotiate. We can probably massage this into something neutral. After all, if we're right, it's good news for the war.*

*That's* if *nothing else happens,* Yuma thought. *We won't have control of the situation.*

*Can we honestly say we do even now?* Kyouko thought. *We've lived with crazier shit than this. I know what you both think of the Church, but we can be ready to do a positive PR push, all positive anecdotes and stories. Try to make ourselves look better, since y'all are going to be dragged in with us. More to the point, do we really have a choice?*

They didn't; the rest was prevarication.

"Fine, we accept your terms," Yuma said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clarisse van Rossum had never been a fan of the Mitakihara Armory.

Was it conveniently located, just underground of central Mitakihara? Yes. Was it a major Church of Hope hub, complete with a well‐populated dormitory and plenty of amenities? Yes.

But she was far past the target age group---speaking conservatively---and, more importantly, she just wasn't a fan of underground bunkers. This one had been scooped out of the earth as part of Governance's hurried early war fortification efforts, and all the renovations since had failed to really hide that. As someone who had more experience with underground bunkers than most living, she didn't care to be reminded of the experience.

Which was part of why it was so galling that the Church had been forced to the Armory, occupying a section of the dormitory block.

As she stepped inside, she took a moment to inspect the drawings pinned to the tunnel walls, a reliable indicator of the mood of local residents. There were depictions of the recent battle near the pulsar, paeans to the recent dead, and a few drawings of Shizuki Ryouko, very much alive.

She stepped inside, scooting out of the way of a passing drone, a small flat platform trudging along on eight mechanical legs, bearing a large potted ficus on top. They were very popular among local residents, wired into and capable of responding to the needs of the plants themselves, which was reasonably charming until you found a pair of them shoving each other over access to the best light.

She frowned, taking a moment to trawl through her thoughts. No, that wasn't her own nostalgia, but someone else's, a ghost memory seeping in from her magic.

She took a moment to savor it, honoring the dead in one of the ways only she could.

Then she pressed onward, past the new passive security checkpoint and a pair of girls who were politely staring, then through Kyouko's already open office door, which slid closed a second later.

Her eye lingered on a framed drawing mounted on the wall--abstract specks of colored light on a dark background, signed "Kishida Maki".

Then she turned towards Kyouko, who was seated in a cushioned chair away from her desk, one leg draped over an armrest, eyes flickering over something unseen.

"Some very interesting things in the news nowadays," Kyouko said, without preamble.

"Indeed," Clarisse said. "Almost too much to go through. In other times, a lot of this news would be *the* big news of the day. Instead, it's just another bombshell to the pile. For some of these, that might even be a good thing."

For instance, the *true* story of how Yuma had killed Oriko was setting parts of the internet astir, but not much more than that. Given how much she knew Yuma hated being laid bare to the public like that, she could only imagine she was breathing a sigh of relief.

Kyouko smiled crookedly.

"I don't think this one will be going away so easily," she said.

Clarisse smiled thinly, strolling over to the chair in front of Kyouko's desk, even if Kyouko wasn't currently seated behind it.

"You mean Mami and Yuma receiving visions from the Goddess," she said. "Yes, given the implications for the war effort, I can't imagine that smoothing over quite so easily."

She paused for a moment.

"I can only assume you've talked it over with them. They'll have to be ready to handle the reputation hit. Some of us have suffered much worse."

She knew Kyouko caught the point---some of them, like Nadya, had died recently. Next to that...

"They'll deal with it," Kyouko said briskly. "They're old enough for that. Far more important will be the Church's policy moving forward. All of this will bring a lot more publicity down on our heads, good and bad, and the crux of it will be how we present our Goddess."

Clarisse met Kyouko's gaze, letting a rhetorical beat pass. They both knew the real contours of this conversation: tomorrow the Theological Council would meet and discuss the future of the Church.

"Many on the Council will want to use the opportunity to evangelize," Clarisse said. "They will not care so much what the mundane world as a whole thinks of us, as long as there are some mages who will be convinced to give us a try. Montalcini already thinks our current approach is too quiet. She will say that this news is a sign of the Goddess's intent to be known, that she has finally blessed us with credible proof of her existence. We can seal the deal with a generation of converts when Shizuki Ryouko returns."

"And what do you think?" Kyouko asked.

"That if the Goddess truly cared about racking up believers she'd make it a bit more obvious than this," Clarisse said. "I know her better than most, and there's always an angle---some way of looking at it---that leads to the general good. The way this played out suggests that she thinks there's something important for the public to know, not that she wants more followers."

"It'd be pretty obvious what that would be then, right?" Kyouko said. "She wants the world to know about Ryouko and the other aliens. That has to be it. It's easy to see why that could be important."

"I agree," Clarisse said.

Kyouko dropped her leg, leaning back into her chair for a few seconds. A robot skittered out of a tube at the foot of the wall, bearing a tray from which she grabbed a chocolate wafer on a plate.

"It's not just that, I think," she said, tapping the wafer against the side of the plate. "I don't believe we should just be a reflection of the Goddess's intent. I don't think She even *wants* that of us. We should be trying to make our own impression on the world---and if we really screw it up somehow, She'll work around us."

"That's your opinion, yes," Clarisse said. "There are some on the Council who would disagree. The wisdom of relying on the Goddess to bandage up our mistakes is, perhaps, unclear."

Kyouko rolled her eyes.

"Spare me. I know you agree with me. You have a better insight into the Goddess than anyone. Almost anyone."

"Well, what is the impression you want to make, then?" Clarisse asked, brushing aside the context. "That's where this is going, isn't it?"

"Right," Kyouko said, clenching and unclenching one hand. "I didn't found this Church *just* to spread the good news of the Goddess, but to try and *do* some good, especially after the early war. It was the only thing any of us could do, try to tinker around the edges. You get more done than getting yourself killed at the front, but not a ton more than that. Now we have the chance to do much more than that."

Clarisse tilted her head slightly.

"You want to try to end the war."

"The information in the recent visions is quite clear," Kyouko said. "If you wanted to, you could view it in despair---that the aliens are intergalactic, that they have colonized the Sagittarius black hole, that they have more resources than we could ever imagine---but that'd be a useless way to look at it. A species with internal politics is one that can be negotiated with, maybe even made friends with. *If* we can just push the assholes in front of us out of the way. I've spoken with Mami; her thinking is the same."

"Not an easy proposition," Clarisse pointed out immediately, having already thought about the matter. "At the moment we have no clear way of reaching these other aliens, no way of knowing what they want, and no way of contacting Shizuki Ryouko. There's no obvious way forward."

"But that doesn't mean there's nothing we can do," Kyouko said. "We can prepare the ground, make sure we're ready when the opportunity comes, and it *will* come, or else there's no reason the Goddess would do any of this."

She paused, making sure Clarisse was following, then continued.

"That means taking Yuma‐chan's data, convincing whoever we can that what we know is valid, that Ryouko is alive, and that Mami is not crazy to be studying the aliens more carefully and preparing for diplomacy. At the very least, we can convince Governance to take the possibility seriously. After all, it's not like the vision is the only evidence---the data from the asteroid implies much the same thing."

Clarisse considered the matter for a moment.

"So in the short term, that actually *doesn't* look much different from evangelization, just with a different ultimate goal, and differently textured arguments. We will still have to convince Nakihara‐san to work with us, for instance."

"Yes, but we won't focus on just magical girls, like some on the Council want. Our mundane relations, and our relations with Governance, will be important. And for that, we have a trump card."

Clarisse raised an eyebrow.

"And what would that be?"

Kyouko leaned over.

"Did you know that a Version Two Tactical Computer, built into the spine of a magical girl, is capable of receiving visions?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asami really didn't want to see Ryouko's parents right now.

Walking up to two people who clearly loved Ryouko deeply, who had been mourning their child for over a week, and telling them that *actually, according to "a vision" you had received from "a Goddess" of a cult they distrust, Ryouko was still alive---and no, there's no physical proof whatsoever...

It was almost an unbearable notion.

But when Tomoe Mami herself showed up at her door and broached the notion---ever so carefully, it was all her choice---she could see the painful logic, the necessity of it.

She didn't *really* have a choice. She had lived with Kuroi Nakase, had been treated like a daughter, had watched her try and flip eggs for them. There were obligations, especially considering what she had done to her own family. Now that Ryouko was alive again, the universe was no longer in debt to her---perhaps the opposite.

Mami had been careful not to frame it that way, but Asami understood what was unsaid. In the end, Ryouko's parents had loved her for fifteen years, and they deserved to know if their daughter was still alive.

More practically---and this Mami *had* pointed out---given the rumors spreading through and from the Cult, there was a need to prevent some kind of unfortunate incident involving Ryouko's parents, however that might arise.

So she found herself standing nervously outside one of Mitakihara's skyscrapers, gathering herself on the arrival pad before heading up to Shizuki Kuma's apartment. The walk was short, only a dozen feet or so to the doorway, then a brief ride up the already‐waiting elevator, but the others had decided to wait here to give Asami a chance to catch her breath, so to speak.

Those with her were MSY royalty: Tomoe Mami and Sakura Kyouko. Mami seemed a bit tense, in a bit of a hurry---or maybe it was her imagination.

Kyouko showed the most emotion, tapping her fist against the glass‐and‐steel railing rhythmically, the distant sun visible only as shimmer through all buildings and skyways around them.

On the ride over, Kyouko had explained that she was the one who had first introduced Ryouko's contract to her parents. Asami could understand not wanting to see them again under the circumstances.

It still felt strange to her, being around these people as if they were her* mentors, but she was important too, now.

That was what she told herself, at least.

"Ready to go?" Mami asked, finally.

Asami felt a jolt of nervousness, but nodded anyway. She was as ready as she was ever going to be.

They made their way into the building, and she found herself glad that the hallways were deserted.

Ryouko's father stood up to greet them at the door as they arrived.

"Thanks for having us here at a time like this," Mami said, bowing slightly.

Kuma nodded, pointing the group towards the sitting room, where Nakase was already seated, watching them over a cup of tea. She nodded at Asami as they met eyes.

"Good to see you again," Nakase said.

"Good to see you," Asami echoed.

She also greeted Ryouko's grandfather, Kuroi Abe, who evidently had leave to be here for the funeral.

Lovely, even more relatives to embarrass herself in front of.

They took their seats, and all except Kyouko politely demurred the offer of synthesized cookies.

"Alright," Mami began, once they had settled down. "Let's begin. There's no need to make this more complicated than it has to be."

There was a long beat of silence.

"Go ahead," Kuma said, holding his own cup of tea in both hands.

He cast a glance at Asami, and she could feel his curiosity. Neither he nor Nakase had likely worked out what this was about, or what it had to do with her.

"We're here because you're very soon going to start hearing people from the Cult of Hope claiming that your daughter, Shizuki Ryouko‐san, is still alive," Mami said. "This won't just be the usual social media noise you can filter out, but something more serious and ongoing. As you may know, the members of the Cult occasionally receive what they claim to be prophetic visions. Recently, there's been one that claims your daughter is alive, and this information has already leaked into rumor and media. We thought it would be unconscionable not to warn you about this in advance."

Asami couldn't help but shrink into her seat as the two parents reacted, first with shock, then with confusion and wariness, glancing back and forth between everyone involved.

"It would also be remiss of me not to mention that I have had a vision myself," Mami said. "So I can vouch for their likely veracity. That too will be in the news soon enough."

It was an impressive show of composure, delivering incredible‐sounding information in a perfectly serious tone.

Kuma's face had frozen into a mask of incredulity, but Nakase seemed to take in the message, blinking a few times. For his part, Abe seemed merely thoughtful.

"You mean Ribbon visions?" Nakase said emptily. "Ryouko‐chan had told me she had a couple, though only some of the details. Asami too..."

She looked towards Asami, whose eyes widened.

Kuma cut in before either of them could say anything.

"The Cult talked up quite a storm about saving us all when Prometheus was attacked, so I learned a bit about these vision claims," he said. "To be frank, I've been pretty skeptical. Besides that, no one ever told me Ryouko‐chan claimed any visions herself, nor did I think someone as senior as Tomoe‐san was involved in any of that."

Mami absorbed the sharp look, then replied:

"Well, I wasn't. But besides the personal experience, I have evidence that at least some visions are quite true, and that includes what happened at Prometheus. We even have experimental evidence, if you'd care to review it. But the most important thing here is probably the source of the vision claiming your daughter to be alive, Nakihara‐san here."

It took a few seconds for the parents to absorb that last fact.

"Experimental evidence, that's a new one," Abe said. "None of my Cult member friends seem to have much of the sort."

He shrugged, a bit sheepishly, at the expressions of surprise from Ryouko's parents.

"I've had my share of contact with the Cult while in the military," he said. "Some of the devout ones have very interesting stories. Actually, a couple have already reached out to me claiming Ryouko‐chan was alive, but, well, I didn't take them seriously. I'm sorry, but the ridiculous rumors about Ryouko‐chan sometimes... I thought this was just more of the same."

Nakase turned back towards Mami.

"Well, we will definitely want to take you up on your offer of evidence, but..."

She looked inquiringly at Asami, who took a breath. They had agreed that Asami wouldn't have to say anything, but Asami found herself holding her hand up to stop Mami from speaking for her.

"No, I'll do it," she said. "If I'm going to believe it, I need to act like I do, not hide in a corner."

She wasn't *really* sure if she believed that, and she could read the skepticism on the others' faces, but Mami nodded.

"Alright. I'm not sure I agree with that reasoning, but it *is* probably better if you say it."

"There's always been a Goddess, or something, who shows up to talk to us---me and Ryouko---whenever we visit the Ribbon in the Cult headquarters. Both of us have talked to her, and she's quite powerful. Ryouko said she claimed to be behind a lot of things, particularly related to her. She had good evidence too. We never really talked about it in that much detail with you, because well, Ryouko never seemed comfortable with it."

She could feel Nakase's eyes on her, and she didn't look up. It wasn't as if they had lied, not really.

"I'd be lying if I said I didn't know there was more going on," Nakase said. "But it seemed better not to ask. So, this woman told you Ryouko‐chan is still alive, and you believed her? I think the details are important here."

Asami felt herself tensing up, and took a breath to calm herself.

"She's apparently ended up on an alien ship, heading through a wormhole in the galactic core," Asami said. "Supposedly, these aliens are 'gentler'."

"Ceph, gentle?" Kuma asked, with plenty of skepticism in his voice. "No, before that, you say they took her on a ship?"

"Before *that*, should we believe it?" Nakase asked. "I'm... I don't want to get my hopes up for something like this. Why would you even tell me something like this? What am I supposed to do now?"

The suddenly angry tone of her voice tore into Asami, leaving her briefly speechless as she bit back a wave of emotion. What kind of response was that?

A response she recognized, she thought. That exact thought had been in her mind when she had first talked with Simona.

"I've looked into the topic a bit myself," Abe said, looking at his daughter. "Claimed visions rarely prove to be wrong, but they're also rarely falsifiable to start with. What Mami‐san and Nakihara‐san are talking about seems different. I---"

He seemed to think better of what he was about to say, stopping there.

"I can't honestly tell you if you should believe it," Mami said, intervening. "We just thought you should know, and that this was the superior option to letting you hear about it from some well‐meaning acquaintance or a stranger on the street. It might have been better if none of this had gotten out at all, but the media got hold of it. At that point the choice was made."

Kyouko cleared her throat, interjecting into the conversation for the first time.

"I'm sorry about that," she said. "The reporter was literally hanging around outside, we couldn't stop them from learning what had happened with Nakihara‐san. We might have considered releasing the news anyway, but we would have at least told you first."

There were a few moments of silence.

"You all believe it," Kuma said.

"Yes," Mami and Kyouko said, almost simultaneously.

"Yeah," Asami echoed.

"We're still going to attend the funeral, with your permission," Mami said, "and we won't undermine it or let the media derail it. After that, how much you want to hear from us is up to you."

Ryouko's parents mulled over that, but Nakase spoke first.

"Do you think it would be possible to see one of these supposed visions? We could pay a visit to the Ribbon ourselves, and take a look."

Mami looked at Kyouko, who visibly grimaced.

"Even if I could tell you who the Goddess will and won't see, which I can't," she said, "every vision so far has involved a magical girl. In fact, our current rules bar non‐magical girls. I could probably push through a special case for you pretty easily, given, um, your past, but I honestly wouldn't expect anything."

There was a moment of silence.

"This has just made everything much harder than it was before," Nakase said. "But... I don't know. Should I feel hope? I don't think you know the answer to that."

She turned to Asami.

"Will you still be going to the funeral?" she asked. "I can imagine it would be difficult to sit through, but I can't imagine---"

"Yes, I will," Asami blurted out. "I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression. I'll just... sit in the back and not say anything."

In truth, until that moment she hadn't been able to make up her mind if she wanted to go.

Nakase seemed to consider the matter for a moment, then put the tea she had not been drinking aside.

She glanced at Kuma, clearly exchanging some kind of message with him.

"Well, we can look over the supposed experimental evidence in a bit, once you send us the files, but for now---"

She looked pointedly at Asami.

"---you say you had a vision about Ryouko‐chan. Why don't you tell us about it. All the details."

Asami sucked in a breath.

"Alright," she said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, an update had arrived in Simona's case.

Simona knew what the hold‐up had been, of course. Clarisse van Rossum had kindly informed her.

Normally, crimes as straightforward as hers---dereliction of duty, insubordination, and several counts of assault, all well‐attested---would be tried and judged by the appropriate AIs within days. Governance prided itself on its efficiency, after all. Unfortunately, her case had been caught in a bit of political tug‐of‐war.

Matters of military law involving magical girls were the province of the Special MSY Military Law and Code of Conduct, whose provisions were the subject of constant supervision and negotiation by the General Staff and an MSY liaison. The compromise was that, generally speaking, Governance could fine, demote, and revoke privileges to its heart's content, while the MHD remained in charge of rehabilitation.

In this case, however, Governance's view was that the MSY had handled Simona rather poorly---both with regard to her information about the TCF breach and her placement into the pulsar mission. They were thus unwilling to let the MSY take clear control of her again. Not without further assurances, at least.

She had been summoned in‐person to Mitakihara's MSY district, to a nondescript low‐level floor labeled on her map only as "administrative". There, she would meet with the MSY liaison, who would update her on her case and when she could expect her sentencing. She would be assigned a magical girl escort for the trip, naturally, and the message had gone on to remind her that Governance and the MSY reserved the power to use coercive force and mind‐reading at any time.

But she was used to all that, she thought, as she stepped into the polished marbled entryway of whatever building this was, silently shadowed by her escort. She hoped she was at peace with it.

The woman who appeared on the other side of the atrium seemed to have gone out of her way to fulfill every stereotype of a pre‐Unification Wars lawyer. Her appearance was naggingly familiar, though, and unless Simona missed her guess...

"Shizuki Ume, at your service," the woman said, bowing in her direction. "I've been advocating for you with Governance."

Ah, of course, Simona thought, verifying the woman's assertion on her nomenclator. No way Ryouko's relatives would stay out of this.

This one wasn't a magical girl, though.

The woman gestured at her to follow her into the building, handing her a tablet as they turned to walk. Simona could see at a glance that it displayed her personal information, the details of her situation, and what seemed like references to legal documentation for the MSY and Governance. Nothing she didn't already know.

"I'm sorry for the delay," the woman said. "The world has been in quite the uproar recently, of course, but that's no excuse. I hope you'll find that the outcome is worth the wait---I fought hard for it, given your unfortunate circumstances."

"My unfortunate circumstances," Simona repeated, displeased.

"Yes," Ume said. "Multiple of them. You were rushed into service without proper training or acclimatization to military command structure. You were deliberately assigned to a girl you were in love with, compromising your judgment. And then you were deployed into combat! That was outright illegal, you know. The Special Magical Girl Conscription Act is very clear in specifying a minimum of thirteen years of *age* for combat involvement---there's no exception for girls who had their mental development accelerated. There's clear precedent in several cases dating back to just after the Unification Wars."

Simona raised an eyebrow, taking in the barrage of words.

"I don't believe any of that is mitigating, but I can swallow my pride, I suppose," she said, trying to ignore the usage of past tense regarding Ryouko. At least the woman was astute enough not to offer her condolences.

"You claimed there was good news?"

"Yes," the woman said. "You'll see, once we get to our destination."

Simona waited for the conversation to continue, then decided she was fine with the silence. They couldn't be that far away, or they would have landed on a different floor, or at least taken an elevator.

Indeed, it was only twenty seconds later that they stepped through an open doorway, and Simona was forced to raise an eyebrow at the occupant---well, avatar of an occupant.

"Hello again," Chitose Yuma said.

It took Simona a moment to confirm who she was looking at, doublechecking with her nomenclator. Yuma wasn't in her usual form, the form Simona had met in the catacombs of Paris, but one at least five years older. Though, in her current state, post‐pulsar mission, Simona was still the physical elder---for as much as that mattered.

Perhaps the MSY had won control over her after all. But why was Chitose here personally? The last time they had met, Simona had had cards to play---this time around, she didn't know that she had anything the woman wanted. Perhaps she held a grudge? Simona had, after all, all but betrayed their previous deal.

She didn't get ahead of herself, waiting for Ume to take a seat and gesture her into a chair as well. She had been told there was good news. In situations like this it was better to take your time, using the silence to think and prepare yourself.

*The party with the stronger hand often uses silence as a rhetorical weapon, to elicit a reaction they can use to gain even further control. This, at least, you can deny them.*

Lessons from her training. Akemi Homura's lessons, though she hated to acknowledge that.

She had also been told to avoid interacting with the truly old. Winning the exchange just wasn't worth the effort. Not that she typically had a choice.

Yuma smiled slightly, knowingly, and Simona remembered that her escort was probably reading her mind.

Yuma leaned back in her virtual chair.

"As you've deduced," she said, "I'm here to offer you a plea deal. Governance will offer you one as well. Now, in the greater scheme of things, given your circumstances, neither the MSY nor Governance are all that interested in making an example out of you. So, the question is simply who you want in charge of your compensatory service and rehabilitation. Personally, I'd rather you worked for me than let Governance garrison you on some frontier colony world. You owe us more than that, I think."

Simona considered the situation. It seemed that she yet had some power, after all. Governance and the MSY had apparently compromised, leaving to Simona the decision of who to gift her chains. And Yuma wanted them.

Or, so she wanted Simona to think.

Simona cracked a smile.

"I had been thinking a D&R stint wouldn't be that bad. I've heard that the wilderness can be quite spectacular, depending on where you go."

Yuma tilted her head, acknowledging the joke.

"Still, it'd be a waste. You're the only one Akemi Homura has deigned to send us from whatever organization she's running. We're going after the same enemy. I won't say working for me will be similar, since it'll be much less undercover, but I think the conditions will be more to your liking."

Simona pulled herself up in her chair, making her body language clearly say that she was thinking.

There really wasn't anything immediately objectionable about Yuma's proposal. Indeed, Simona *wanted* to continue her mission---it had been her whole life, and she was rather invested in its outcome. There was also a certain professional satisfaction that came with doing work she was good at---she had never hated the work itself, just the lack of choice, and what it had done to her most important relationship.

It wasn't the same as being able to be with Ryouko again, but it was better than being thrown off the playing board by Governance.

Well, assuming that was even possible. For all that she despised Homura for how she had been used, she knew that if one of Homura's agents were to swoop down and pluck her out from garrison duty, she still wouldn't say no.

The question was: What didn't she know?

"I'm interested," she said, knowing there was no point in pretending otherwise for leverage. "But what are the other details here? Would I be working just for you? Who else is involved?"

Yuma sent over a briefing, about a new MSY task force formed under the Intelligence subcommittee. It sounded almost aboveboard---a welcome change from her previous experiences---though she wasn't sure how she felt about the involvement of some of the girls she had met on Adept Blue. It wasn't that she hated them, but, well, who knew how they felt about her now?

At least it would save her having to explain things again.

Yuma had also sent over the full plea deal she'd be taking. Forfeiture of all current financial assets and any income beyond basic Alloc distribution for two years, eighteen months' probation under Goverance, and indefinite weekly MHD sessions until she was deemed "healthy". How merciful.

Yuma watched her for a few seconds as she thought.

"There's no catch here, Del Mago," she said. "At least not one that I intend. You'd face the same financial penalties and probation with Governance's offer, and you want the extra MHD attention we'd give you."

"Do I?" Simona asked. "If I'm going to be asked to accept Shizuki Ryouko's death, I doubt I'll ever be deemed 'healthy'."

Yuma smiled vaguely, and Simona couldn't decide if the woman was amused or smiling ironically.

"I can take care of that part," she said. "I wouldn't worry about it."

Simona considered asking for more details, but was interrupted by an incoming stream of secure files.

"Here. Your potential first assignment," Yuma said.

Simona stayed silent as she reviewed the files, detailing what had already been discovered about Valentin's operations in Argentina---specifically, the ones that had resulted in the birth of Simona and her cohort. That kind of illegal work had left a trail that even Valentin hadn't been able to fully conceal, and there was still much to dig into.

She took a deep breath.

"I'm in," she said.

"I'll go tell Governance they've lost, then," Shizuki Ume said. "Politely, of course."

Yuma smiled unsettlingly, face framed by now very long hair that shimmered slightly in the light.

"Welcome to the team."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It wasn\'t one straight jump, galactic core to galactic core. Instead, they routed through the intergalactic void, guests to wandering star systems and rogue black holes, watched by the two great, spiral eyes of the Milky Way and Andromeda.

Which meant that, yes, the aliens had found small oases of gravitationally‐bound systems to establish wormholes in, out in the wilderness between galaxies. The Thinkers had ventured out from Andromeda the slow way, by standard FTL, stopping to build wormhole stabilizers and other necessary facilities at apt locales. The work had continued for over a thousand years, until finally the great chain was complete all the way to the center of the Milky Way.

That the implications about Cephalopod capabilities were immense would be understating the matter. The aliens were even willing to discuss the relevant technology, for once, as it was surprisingly prosaic: cruiser‐sized ships optimized for hauling exotic matter fuel on single month‐long journeys, who continually built up fuel dumps until the next system could be reached by cargo and construction vessels.

Even with all that, Lush‐Botanist could not reach Andromeda *too easily. Ryouko would have nearly a full week between galaxies.

It was, at least, a good opportunity for some reflection.

She had already spent plenty of time digging into the notion of pref‐specs, and the newly uncovered organ in her brain dedicated to pref‐spec management. More than simply providing her access to Cephalopod communication and mindsets, it had the unsettling ability to alter her *own* pref‐spec.

Supposedly, anyway. Magical girls were supposed to be able to resist alterations to their mental states and core identities, with the soul gem serving as guarantor. But did changing *yourself* follow the same rule?

It was difficult to wrap her mind around what that even *meant*, but apparently self‐alteration wasn\'t uncommon among the aliens---besides the binding‐preference‐alteration‐agreements, for instance, it was normal to deliberately increase one\'s suitability for a necessary long‐term task just before performing it, with provision for a mandatory reset later.

*Not* too *different from specialist AIs undergoing reprogramming, Clarisse pointed out, a day into the trip, as Ryouko lay down on her bed.

*Though not too similar either,* Clarisse added, when she didn\'t respond right away. *There are also some rumors that telepaths can temporarily alter themselves.*

Ryouko summoned her soul gem, setting it on the nearby shelf next to a grief cube. The shelf was recessed in the wall and seemed to be of a bony material that was nonetheless capable of changing shape on command.

Instinctively, she checked the grief cube. Nearly full, she thought. She\'d have to replace it after this.

*There\'s even a pref‐spec changelog,* Ryouko thought. *I wonder...*

She inspected the changelog with an act of mental focus. The results appeared in her mind a moment later.

*Though mine is empty. I guess that shouldn\'t be too surprising.*

Ryouko felt an odd sense of discomfort from Clarisse.

*I wouldn\'t be so sure,* Clarisse thought. *Your empathy‐organ wasn\'t fully functional until Peace‐cultivating completed it; the logging may not have been working.*

Ryouko thought about that.

*You might know better than me. Still, it\'s not like I was using this thing before. Haven\'t you been monitoring it?*

Another wave of discomfort.

*Yes, but only since we learned about it in Paris,* Clarisse thought, At this point, I\'m pretty sure I know what it might look like to actually trigger a pref‐spec modification, and while I can say with some confidence none have happened since then...*

There was a palpable silence, and Ryouko felt a sense of unease spreading within her.

*Are you trying to tell me something, Clarisse?* she asked, finally.

*How much do you want to hear it?* Clarisse asked. *I\'m not entirely sure about it; I can\'t be, without asking the aliens for their analysis. I wouldn\'t want to say anything, except for that you\'ve said you want to be informed about matters like this.*

Ryouko swallowed slightly. She *had* said that, but of course Clarisse\'s judgment about these matters was pretty good---whatever this was, she *really* wasn\'t going to like it.

But she didn\'t believe in lying to herself, at least in theory, and she had been inundated recently by unpleasant revelations. How bad could this one be?

*Go ahead,* she thought.

*I think you modified your pref‐spec when you first agreed to be Asami\'s girlfriend. I didn\'t have any reason to pay special attention to your brain activity at the time, so my recordings are incomplete, but I think it\'s at least more likely than not.*

Clarisse\'s caveats faded into the background as the notion worked itself into Ryouko\'s mind. Now that the idea had been said out loud, it made... just too much sense. Clarisse didn\'t need to explain what specific moment she was referring to, or even that it was a moment; Ryouko remembered well how it had felt, the feeling of a lever in her mind, the sense of choice, and certainty.

*I wouldn\'t think about it too much,* Clarisse thought, soothingly. People change themselves all the time, and always have, and AIs sometimes edit themselves. This isn\'t very different. Plus, we\'re not even sure.*

Ryouko felt a chill start to grip her heart, but found to her surprise that it passed quickly. Indeed, she remembered how it had felt---remembered how isolated she had felt, how isolated she *knew Asami felt, and how much she had wanted to fix that. She had wanted to change, and to be able to reciprocate Asami\'s feelings, in her own way.

So she had decided to change. Was it really so bad?

*Let\'s talk to Peace‐cultivating,* Clarisse suggested. *As I said, the aliens might be able to help with this analysis. And the underlying philosophy regarding sentients. After all, the aliens change their pref‐specs without worrying about it too much.*

Ryouko wasn\'t sure how to broach a topic like that, but did her best to convince herself she was being silly: the Cephalopods didn\'t have emotions, and she could only imagine that they would be more than willing to field questions about her own pref‐spec, which had continued to fascinate them.

It took her a few seconds to understand why she felt so nervous even asking. It felt like some kind of judgment on her relationship with Asami, she realized, clenching some of her lumpy blanket in her hands. Like it was somehow less real if a pref‐spec modification had really happened. How would she act, the next time she met Asami? Would she doubt her own feelings?

And, perhaps worse, what would Asami think? She would have to tell her.

But there was no getting around it, and after a bit of prevarication, she formulated the question, even forwarding a data file of neural recordings that Clarisse claimed she had reformatted into something the aliens might better understand.

Ryouko swallowed her trepidations about sharing a neural recording. The aliens had literally been doing surgery on her recently, after all.

She sat up from the bed, dropping her feet over the side and letting the lumpy blanket cling to her.

It took a moment for Peace‐cultivating, elsewhere in the ship, to reply to her:

*`!μ·An exquisite puzzle; you have my thanks|v·Indeed, your pref‐spec changelog could not have functioned until I completed your empathy‐organ|μ+·I will run your neural traces through Lush‐Botanist's analysis engine, as your unfamiliar physiology may otherwise mislead me`*

*\|v·I see\|μ·Thank you, I will wait,* Ryouko thought, because there really wasn\'t much else to say.

She had come to prefer Lush‐Botanist to Peace‐cultivating, in the few days she had known them. Peace‐cultivating\'s zeal for mutual understanding was a bit unnerving to her, even in the cause of peace, and made it more difficult to keep the secrets she was holding onto.

*`μ∪·My results report a very high likelihood‒94% that you successfully managed to self‐modify|μ∪·Your neural activity was far above baseline and consistent with a moderate write operation|ξ∈?·Do you have any similar experiences to report—your pref‐spec implies that larger changes than this have occurred during your life|ξ∈?·Do you find these notions unpleasant`*

Ryouko didn\'t answer right away, struck by the dual surprises that the change had been comparatively minor and that the alien had successfully surmised her mood.

She barely understood her own thoughts on the matter. What hope did she have translating it for an alien?

*\|\|ξ·No, nothing like this\|ξ∈·I am not sure if I should find it unpleasant---our species is not used to the idea of changing our preferences so directly\|ξ∈·I am... worried that I undermined the integrity of my mind, and my relationship*

The reply took a few seconds.

*`·Your worries ≈ confusing the sky for the sea|+·You value control over your life, as you should, and pref‐spec‐modification is the essential form of control|+·Personal integrity, and identity, is rooted in meaningful control over self, watered by memories, actions, and social ties—and, unfortunately, endangered by reality‐warping`*

Ryouko frowned, turning the argument over in her mind. In retrospect, it shouldn\'t have been surprising that the aliens would see nothing wrong with pref‐spec‐modification, or that they\'d identify magic instead as the potentially corruptive ability. That was what the war was supposed to be about, after all.

She wondered what Peace‐cultivating would think, if he knew about how Asami\'s wish had altered her parents.

The alien sent nothing further, so Ryouko closed their telepathic connection, uncertain what she had achieved.

*It\'s not exactly a Hollywood romance,* Clarisse thought. *But I think he has a point about pref‐spec‐modification. I\'d argue that humans push themselves into enjoying all kinds of things, including relationships. You did it yourself, with Asami,* apart *from your empathy‐organ. When you pushed yourself to tell Asami you loved her, for example, you didn\'t activate it. I\'m not sure the type of chemicals or organ involved really matter, ultimately.*

*It\'s a bold claim to say that the alien organ in my brain doesn\'t really matter,* Ryouko thought sardonically.

She took a while to think more seriously on the topic.

*Still,* she thought, *there is also what he said about memories and actions. Everything I\'ve done with Asami since then, and before then, is bigger than a single decision. I could have broken things off. Honestly, Asami could have too---I know she wanted to just hide at home and cuddle. But she went out to X‐25 and the pulsar for my sake.*

*I don\'t know if I would say it was entirely for your sake,* Clarisse thought, *but I think Asami would broadly agree. She would mostly just want you back alive.*

Ryouko looked at her soul gem, which had finished discharging on its shelf, and nodded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> I hope you\'re not forgetting about me out there, amidst all the excitement. I know a relationship with me wasn\'t how you envisioned things.

Asami frowned, chewing over the thought, then struck the lines out. It sounded way too clingy and insecure, even if it was honestly a bit how she felt. More importantly, they had been together long enough that she could trust Ryouko not to lose interest in her.

> Obviously I don\'t know what\'s happening to you, or what you\'re doing, but if this could reach you, I\'d want you to know I am waiting for your return. The Goddess did us the courtesy of telling me you lived. I hope friendlier aliens really are a thing. Not just for your sake, but for everyone\'s sake.

Better, even if it sounded pretty sappy. Really, how was she supposed to avoid sounding sappy? Sappy was just how this kind of thing *was*. The important thing was that it expressed her real feelings, and that the recipient could *tell* that. She wasn\'t here to write empty bromides; otherwise, the writing would do no good in consolidating her feelings.

And that was the point, after all. It wasn\'t like Asami could actually send* any letters to Ryouko. These were for herself, to help her unburden her heart, as Arisu had put it.

She continued:

> They held your funeral a few days ago. It was all very surreal to have to undergo. I hated it, of course, the whole experience of having to play pretend, because I don\'t want to look all crazy and wild‐eyed, if that makes sense.

She thought about those lines. Ryouko liked explicit, even pedantic explanations of feeling, so being direct was fine. And if she sounded more formal than usual: well, it was a letter. So what? But where was she going with this?

> I thought I could relax when it was all over, but instead I find myself stuck in a state of tension. Your old friend---it\'s kind of funny to me to call her that---Mami‐san got caught by a reporter visiting the Ribbon, along with *Chitose Yuma*, and they were overheard talking about their visions with the Goddess. So *now there\'s going to be news about that, and they\'re going to have to explain about all that, and why they think you\'re alive.

Asami paused for a moment.

> None of that explains why I\'m involved, of course. Apparently the Cult couldn\'t keep a lid on things, so when *I* visited and learned you were alive, people heard all about it. Well, that\'s mostly Simona\'s fault for yelling about it to anyone who would listen, but I don\'t think I should have been put in that position.
>
> But at least I get the executive treatment now, since I\'m mixed in with Mami‐san and Chitose and the like. Their PR staff and social media people are helping manage my internet presence. It\'s kind of relieving to be honest. I can just sort of let them do the work.

She let out a breath. She hated to admit it, but the MHD was right. This was* a nice way to unwind. She had been avoiding thinking about this whole topic, but now it didn\'t seem so bad.

> It\'s still pretty stressful though. A lot of people have been trying to talk to me---*Aniki* is convinced I\'ve been brainwashed. I\'ve got meetings I have to go, to plan how we\'re going to present things. Or fake things, as the case may be.

Her internal chronometer nudged at her, and she felt a pang of annoyance.

Speaking of those meetings...

She had been called to half a dozen meetings so far, all about coordinating their stories regarding Ryouko and the so‐called TCF conspiracy. It had by this point lost any novelty, but it still made for a change of pace.

She was even looking forward to this particular meeting, even if it had* interrupted her letter‐writing. Kyouko had invited her alone, leaving out the others---Azrael, Patricia, occasionally Yuma or Van Rossum---that usually attended.

Kyouko offered her the chance to discuss some questions in private, and she intended to take advantage of it.

So she changed outfits and rearranged her hair, making sure to display prominently the flower Ryouko had given her, which had settled in quite well among the strands, and even attracted the occasional bee or butterfly. She had made sure *everyone* knew where it was from.

It was a short trip over to Kyouko\'s office in the Mitakihara Armory, too short to give her much time to continue her letter, especially not when she passed right by the construction site encompassing the former Prometheus Research Institute, giving her a view that was worth paying attention to.

She had been to this meeting spot a few times already. While she still felt a bit out of place there, amidst the Cult of Hope, she had been feeling more positive about them lately. They believed her about Ryouko, after all.

Kyouko set the tone with a straightforward briefing, as soon as Asami arrived. There was a brief discussion of the news following recent events---Sacnite had asked Asami to accompany her to the Ribbon, and Nakase had ended up coming as well, though none of them had ended up seeing anything.

Chiyo Rika had portrayed it neutrally, but *apparently* visiting the Ribbon had been a bad idea. *Apparently*, there was an entire conspiracy theory brewing, fed directly by claims made by the TCF conspiracy, that Ryouko, Simona, Sacnite, and Azrael were part of some kind of genetically‐engineered cabal, puppets of either the Cult or someone who controlled the Cult. They were all way too connected for it to be a coincidence, after all.

That kind of nonsense, and frank bigotry, frustrated Asami more than any of the rumors about her did. It was all so stupid, and she was happy to let the Cult and MSY media handlers deal with it for her.

At least there was good news on the war front---despite all the chaos in Human space, the aliens had actually been forced to abandon some of their most forward positions in recent days. The bunkered remains of the colony of Penglai had been rescued that very morning, in fact, and Governance was making sure to credit Ryouko and Asami\'s great blow to Ceph logistics for the victory.

In general, the party line across all recent events had been: the TCF conspiracy managed no lasting physical damage to Humanity, and as long as the public rejected their attempt to sow distrust and disunion, there would be minimal social damage as well. One only needed patience, to wait for the good news that the enemy had been chased down and dismantled.

\"Frankly, we\'re just telling people everything is fine without really knowing that\'s true,\" Asami said, when the time finally came. "There\'s *so* much being left out. Like the assassination attempts. I don\'t care how much we tell people everything is under control, it did not* feel under control to have a support beam blown through my gut. There didn\'t seem to be an MSY master plan *then*.\"

Kyouko peered at her a moment, then sighed, taking a sip of her milk tea. It was a bold move, trying to get an Ancient off‐balance with a sharp change in topic, but Asami figured it was worth a shot. It had been gnawing at her, all the constant talk of media and public image---didn\'t someone need to go out and actually put a stop to whoever had breached the TCF? Was everyone just counting on Homura to handle that?

\"We badly misjudged the threat. They were more powerful than we thought they were, and we were too distracted with our individual concerns. We know better, now.\"

Kyouko paused, weighing her teacup in her hand.

\"Frankly, I\'ve never apologized to you for all the shit you\'ve gone through. It is your right to be angry about it, so I\'m sorry. Sorry we haven\'t been able to protect you, haven\'t been able to fix this world, sorry we\'re still sending girls like you off to war. We, the MSY, were given that responsibility, and we haven\'t fulfilled it. Because, right now, we can\'t.\"

Kyouko tilted her head slightly, regarding Asami\'s surprised reaction with interest.

\"Or, at least, we Ancients can\'t. Because of our age, because of our wisdom, we\'re expected to be special, and we were given leadership to watch over our juniors. But in the end, we are only the sum of our years. For the truly difficult problems, we need you to chip in. It was you and Ryouko who saved my life at X‐25. I haven\'t forgotten that.\"

She set her teacup down, looking Asami in the eye.

Asami had been ready to yell at Kyouko for not doing enough, and found herself undermined by what was nearly a rehearsed speech, an apology, asking for help.

Then...

Asami took a breath.

\"You said something about chipping in, but chipping into *what*? Is that a recruitment pitch? I haven\'t heard anything about what the MSY is doing, only what Governance is doing.\"

She paused, weighing her next words.

\"Unless that\'s what Akemi Homura has been up to,\" she said cautiously. \"I know about that whole thing, with Joanne Valentin. Is she secretly...\"

Kyouko tapped the edge of her desk, as if to interrupt her.

\"We don\'t know what she is doing,\" she said, eyes cast to the side. "The fact is, she won\'t talk to us.\"

She used one hand to push her hair back.

\"Listen, the fact is, we *are* doing more, but I can\'t just tell you everything you want to hear, not unless you\'re ready to commit to making it so you need to know. That means I need to ask what your stance is here. I said I wanted you to chip in, but there\'s more than one way of doing *that*. Would you *like* to be involved with hunting the TCF conspiracy, or would you prefer to stay solely on the wormhole research?\"

Asami peered into Kyouko\'s expression, the eyes carefully watching her, and found to her surprise that she could very much read it. She meant what she said.

\"I mean, it depends on what it would involve,\" Asami said. \"But yes. I barely know what to do with myself right now, and I\'m tired of just letting things happen to us, to me. It\'d be better to be on the offensive. Though I\'m not sure how it would fit around the wormhole and blink research I\'m scheduled to be returning to soon.\"

\"That can be postponed,\" Kyouko said. \"I\'ve already talked with Mami‐san about this---it may not hurt to wait on that until Shizuki‐san\'s return anyway. But are you sure you don\'t just want to keep your focus there? It could also be the case that you\'d be able to contribute to a significant breakthrough on your own.\"

\"I\'ve had a while to think,\" Asami said. \"What I really want is to be with Ryouko, but I can\'t have that, now can I? And maybe I\'m supposed to go work on wormholes so that we can use those to get her back, but the Goddess didn\'t say anything like that, so I\'m just guessing anyway.\"

She shook her head.

\"I\'d rather break down all this mystery and conspiracy that\'s haunted Ryouko and me, so that when she comes back, we don\'t have to live with it hanging over our heads anymore.\"

Kyouko pursed her lips.

\"That sounds good enough for me. Let me fill you in a bit, then.\"

She leaned forward.

\"Because of the dissatisfaction with our past performance and investigations, as well as the failure in preventing the recent attacks, a secret task force has been established to work on the matter, absorbing the existing efforts in this direction. It has a pretty hefty budget, leadership from the senior MSY, and we\'re taking on a good number of experienced personnel. We\'re still spinning that up, but there are a number of efforts already underway.\"

\"If you *are* interested, then I would imagine your specialty would be in fieldwork, particularly in investigating sites suspected of a connection to either the TCF conspiracy or to what Akemi Homura is up to. It\'s, frankly, what you have the most experience in, and we\'d be glad to use you as a detector for stealth devices such as the one we encountered on X‐25. The military would probably try to hang us if we got someone as important as you killed, so it\'d be low‐risk missions, and I already have Azrael Maslanka designated as your initial partner, to help you get up to speed.\"

The torrent of words washed over her, and she couldn\'t help but react with surprise at the mention of Azrael.

\"She\'s involved?\" Asami asked.

\"Yes,\" Kyouko said. \"It\'s the kind of work she does, and she\'s already worked on pursuing Homura before, so it\'s natural.\"

Asami mentally noted the lack of honorific on \"Homura\".

\"Well, I can\'t say I object to working with her,\" she said. "Honestly, I\'m a bit relieved it\'s her.\"

\"Not just her,\" Kyouko said. \"There\'s a small working group we\'re trying to get off the ground. The main angle will be tracking down Homura but it won\'t be limited to that, just because of how much crossover there is with dealing with the TCF conspiracy. That being said, everyone involved has some connection to the topic, and even better, you should already be familiar with most of them. There\'s Shizuki‐san\'s aunt, Shizuki Nana, who used to own this case file. There\'s your training cohort colleague Zhou Meiqing, who was her new recent recruit. And then there\'s Simona del Mago.\"

Kyouko paused meaningfully, letting Asami catch up with the sentence.

\"The personal history here is obvious---\" Kyouko began.

\"What, letting her sabotage one mission wasn\'t enough?\" Asami interrupted. \"Isn\'t she supposed to be serving time somewhere?\"

\"This is part of her penance, as part of a deal with Yuma,\" Kyouko said, closing her eyes for a moment. \"Yuma can be awfully forgiving, if she can make you useful. *I* agreed, because I suspect Del Mago\'s Homura connection is useful and important, and I\'d like to keep an eye on her. Frankly, if you don\'t like it, you\'re under no obligation to work with her directly. There will be multiple roles.\"

Asami could only shake her head. She couldn\'t believe this.

The obvious temptation was to back out, but that was just too obviously self‐defeating. And she couldn\'t even justify the spite necessary to protest further; in the end, Ryouko had lived, so Asami wouldn\'t bury a dagger in Simona\'s back at all costs.

Maybe only at some cost.

Besides, would Ryouko have let a little social awkwardness, a little pride, stand in the way of the better choice? No, she was almost too calculating in that regard---though perhaps that was Clarisse\'s influence.

\"I guess I\'ll just have to accept that,\" she said finally, knowing Kyouko had watched the emotions play out on her face. \"What now then?\"

Kyouko smiled slightly.

\"Order a drink from the bots. Let\'s get you oriented.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Near the end of the trip to Andromeda, Ryouko found herself seated on the sand in the ship\'s oasis, reviewing the details of the new system they were in. This one was named Red Chain Four. Red, because it was a red dwarf, and Chain Four, because it was in the middle of an unusually long chain of red dwarves, gravitationally bound in the midst of intergalactic space. Stellar density was increasing again, and soon a few stars in a row would cease to be notable.

The system was otherwise unremarkable, though it did contain a small rocky world with a struggling population of prokaryotes.

The drone she had asked for finally arrived, and she reached out with one hand to drop in a used grief cube, destined for ejection into deep space. Feathered‐Defender unfurled his head and leaned over for a closer look, making a quiet trilling noise---she had warned the bird about the dangers of contacting grief cubes, but it seemed reluctant to believe her.

But something made her pause before releasing the grief cube, and when the snake‐like drone looked up in apparent confusion, Ryouko realized why.

*Ejecting cubes into deep space! How uncouth!* the Incubator said, materializing into existence next to the drone. *It will be unnecessarily difficult recovering that lost energy.*

It took Ryouko only a moment to conclude that, yes, this was Kyubey, the famous Mitakihara Incubator that had contracted her.

She had been slow to hide her look of shock, and Feathered‐Defender had properly woken up, sidling towards her defensively. She reached out and patted its head reassuringly.

*Sorry,* she thought. *Everything is fine. Go back to sleep.*

It squawked unhappily.

*Will trust you,* it thought.

She had to be careful now---if she showed signs of talking to an invisible creature, there would surely be questions.

*What are you doing here?* she demanded.

*Checking in on you,* the Incubator thought, trotting in a circle around the still‐waiting drone. *I thought you might still be alive and in need of my services.*

She knew enough of MSY rumor to know that the Incubators were not exactly trustworthy. More likely than not, she concluded, the Incubator had come to spy on her, and see what was going on between her and the Thinkers.

A series of thoughts passed through her mind, including a few slipped in by Clarisse.

*Okay, first off, I have* not *told any of the aliens about you,* she thought. *Please don\'t break my cover here.*

*I will not,* the Incubator said, pulling to a stop and sitting down. In fact, I am already altering the relevant surveillance records. It was wise of you to choose secrecy. That is our default policy.*

*The aliens on this ship claim that they are divided into factions, and that the faction attacking us is doing so on false pretenses. Did you know *about this? Know about it and still allow it to happen?*

*We don\'t comment on the internal affairs of other species, nor do we routinely monitor them,* Kyubey said. *Moreover, aside from necessities driven by grief cube harvesting, we are a neutral party in conflicts. Perhaps as a junior magical girl, you do not know this, but the MSY certainly does. Consult your internal records.*

The response raised her hackles, but she did her best to calm herself. Incubator policy was known, and it had been almost a silly question.

Or rather, an emotional question, she supposed.

She closed her eyes, trying to make it look to any monitors like she was in deep thought, or perhaps falling asleep.

*Well, now that you\'re here, you can do a lot to help me,* she said. Will you relay a message back to the MSY for me?*

An ambitious question, but anything she could get out of the Incubator would be worth it. If she could even get a line open indirectly with Governance...

*No I will not,* Kyubey thought. *We don\'t facilitate interstellar communications as a matter of course, and here we could be interfering in the affairs of multiple species.*

It was a disappointing answer, one that again raised her hackles, but again not inconsistent with what she already knew about Incubator policy. Though, as Clarisse was reminding her, the policy was not exactly ironclad. Kyubey\'s ambivalent language suggested as much.

Unfortunately, the firmest part of the rule was also the part most valuable to her---she wasn\'t going to get Kyubey to, say, facilitate peace negotiations.

*Can you at least let them know I\'m alive?* she asked. *Maybe for some compensation?*

Kyubey stood back up, stretching his back with paws forward like a cat waking up from a nap.

*There is no need to,* it thought. *Your mentors and partner all believe you to be alive, based on information given in a vision with the Goddess. I believe that will satisfy you emotionally?*

It took an effort for Ryouko to suppress a reaction. It was a tremendous relief for Asami to believe she was alive, and if even Kyouko and the others believed it---

*Wait, hold on,* Clarisse thought. *Vision with the Goddess?*

*What?*

*Since when would an Incubator refer to \'the Goddess\' so unambiguously?*

*He did show up both of the times I visited the Ribbon...*

*Can you ask?*

This time Ryouko couldn\'t resist opening her eyes, trying to steal a glance at the Incubator, only to find that it was already fading away.

*Are you really just going to leave?* she demanded. *What did you mean by vision with the Goddess? What about the grief cube I\'m holding?*

*I mean just that, of course. And it\'d be troublesome to hide a cube disappearing inside the ship, so I\'ll pick it up when the ship dumps it.*

And then it was gone.

*What the hell?* she thought.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When they finally arrived at M31☆, the black hole center of Andromeda, and Ryouko looked at the sky with the overlay given to her, the galactic center was filled with an overwhelming number of dots---neighboring wormhole relays, scientific outposts, inhabited worlds.

Military installations were few and far between. Perhaps she simply wasn\'t being shown most of them, but somehow she doubted it: she could only imagine how ridiculous the notion of a military threat would seem to such a civilization.

And all of this, two weeks away from human space! She felt as if she had come in from the wilderness.

Lush‐Botanist sent her a message.

*`·Our messengers are underway|·Our local monitors believe‒83% you have arrived undetected`*

She did not need to explain further. Ryouko already knew the plan: Peace‐cultivating and the two other members of the ship\'s crew had spent the past week entering biological suspension, allowing their implants and nanites to painstakingly trace out their neural connections. Even for the Cephalopods, consciousness uploading was an expensive, time‐consuming process, but now came the payoff: they would be beamed immediately back to their Tentacle\'s core worlds, arriving in advance of the ship itself.

It would have normally been enough to send a simple communique, but for a message of such importance, where full pref‐spec‐verification would be called for, this was the best way.

They would have sent Ryouko that way if they could have, but she was both the wrong species and bound to a soul gem.

Not that Ryouko would have welcomed the process; even Peace‐cultivating broaching the idea hypothetically had unnerved her. She knew, though, that the idea she and Clarisse could permanently die, without backup, dissatisfied the aliens\' preferences as well.

She hadn\'t tried to explain the concept of the Goddess to them.

There were other worries that weighed on her mind. None of them were entirely* sure that she had eluded Thinker‐Preserving\'s scans, and no matter how much the ship vouchsafed that an attack was impossible here, she couldn\'t help but be paranoid.

There was at least little time left to be worried. From here it wasn\'t far to one of /Ahimsa‐extending\'s core population centers, Water Circle, near the galactic core. By wormhole, it was only one jump away, though it still required them to transit to and from a nearby black hole, a process that would take about a day.

She spent much of that day in her room with Clarisse, pouring over the new alien records she had access to, now that they were entering friendlier territory. Her access was still... cordially restricted, but just the little peek into /Ahimsa‐extending\'s operations might have been enough to send Governance into conniptions---it clearly implied that /Ahimsa‐extending alone had far more than enough resources to overrun all of Human space, if they fully mobilized.

In a way, that wasn\'t surprising, but Clarisse had spent the past week impressing upon Ryouko that they would be the first humans to ever have access to this information and how it was incumbent on them to, as she put it, process it as thoroughly as possible, along with consulting Governance\'s First Contact and contingency guidelines.

But in the end, there really wasn\'t very much to surmise that wasn\'t immediately obvious, and that Governance hadn\'t already feared. It was seemingly impossible for Humanity to overcome the Thinkers militarily. One hope, perhaps the *only* hope, was to convince the aliens to end the war.

It was a thought that caused Ryouko\'s hair to rise into the air. Neither she nor Clarisse wanted that kind of responsibility.

The final hours of the flight were spent reviewing with Lush‐Botanist exactly what Ryouko would be in store for. The senior leadership of Ahimsa‐extending would gather at Water Circle, where there would be facilities to house all the necessary computation, and then they would interview her---or, more frankly, interrogate her.

But she was able to push those thoughts out of her mind, as they drew close to \"Water Circle\". It wasn\'t a planet, or even a few habitats, but *tens of thousands* of them, a whole ring, countless rotating cylinders orbiting tightly around the parent red dwarf, each the size of a battlecruiser, each with a unique, fully‐managed ecosystem.

Seen by eye, it looked like an illusion, a halo of shimmering dots in the sky. Hence the name, she supposed.

She spent the last minutes of their approach in virtuality, watching as they pulled into the system. She found her feelings difficult to parse: the feats of alien engineering were immense, and she felt a certain amount of awe---but it was almost like it wasn\'t enough, like her consciousness wasn\'t expansive enough to grasp all she should be impressed by. It was too big to appreciate.

The individual habitat they approached, named *Far Sanctuary*, was impressive in its own right, though perhaps no more so than the average battlecruiser. It was ten kilometers in both length and diameter, with two layers that spun in opposite directions, a design Governance itself had used for some of its habitats---though Ryouko had never seen one herself.

This one had apparently been chosen for its broad similarity to Ryouko\'s own life support preferences, with fauna she would be comfortable with. It was also one of the few with the facilities to support an instantiation of the Tentacle\'s administration.

By the time they were cleared to disembark, she was already waiting by the airlock, her scant personal belongings---her combat suit, Homura\'s container of grief cubes---packed onto a nearby drone. Feathered‐Defender walked in circles at her side, with all the excitement of a toddler out for an excursion.

She made her way through the airlock, which shimmered with forcefields in a casual display of superior technology.

She was met at the other side by none other than Lush‐Botanist, now re‐embodied in an organic body, extending her tentacles wide. Ryouko couldn\'t help but notice the metallic ornaments on the sides of the head.

*`·This is not a true body transfer, but merely the active extension of my current self—true transfer would be time‐consuming, inconvenient, and unnecessary|ৡ·Welcome`*

She didn\'t have much time to muse on what it might be like to control two bodies at once, as they stepped out into the receiving yard. She blinked, distracted by the light of a sky she hadn\'t seen in what felt like years---cerulean blue, with a piercing yellow source of light.

Simulated of course, but enough to trigger a wave of nostalgia that contrasted sharply with the crowd gathered nearby---spikes of telepathy supplied her with the missing details, revealing that it was mostly curious locals, mixed in with a few coincidental passerby.

Counterintuitively, this did not present a significant added security risk. The Thinkers here were central members of /Ahimsa‐extending, and they naturally preferred to respect certain rules regarding intra‐tentacle secrets.

Feathered‐Defender ran forward, mingling happily with a crowd of fellow, local \"penguins\" with a chorus of squawks. She couldn\'t help but smile, and then she noticed an unusual alien approaching her.

By now, she had grown used to the bodies she had seen aboard Lush‐Botanist, and she was of course very familiar with the assorted combat versions she had killed so many of, but this one towered over her, nearly half‐again as large as Lush‐Botanist, with proportions to match---and two extra pairs of arms.

*`1fsNc5B⊃Survival‐Optimizer; Administrator‐Specialist`* her empathy‐organ whispered to her.

Ryouko openly gawked, knowing that the aliens could not take offense.

*`μ·The additional volume provides space for extra local compute|v·I reside within Water Circle, and wished to know you and Clarisse⊃??? myself|?μ+·Am I correct in interpreting your behavior as curiosity`*

They exchanged pref‐specs, a process that still sent her head spinning, even with Clarisse offloading some of the information. It was difficult to take in all at once, without the parallelized implant clusters the aliens had.

In the end, Survival‐Optimizer wasn\'t markedly different from the aliens she had already met. There was a much stronger preference for staying in one place and thinking, a focus on protecting the lifeforms under /Ahimsa‐extending\'s care, and an unusual interest in administrative work and large‐scale system optimization.

It was exactly the kind of thing you\'d want from one of the Tentacle\'s senior administrators, the small but rotating group of individuals that ran /Ahimsa‐extending\'s affairs, spending most of their time uploaded to computing clusters. Sort of like Governance, viewed through a *very distorted* mirror. With more tentacles.

She looked at the giant alien with new understanding. She could imagine that body carrying a full supercomputer, and a high‐bandwidth transceiver, and cooling systems.

In fact, in infrared, Survival‐Optimizer looked *very* unusual.

*μ·Humans very rarely modify our bodies to that extent\|\|μ·Yes* Ryouko thought, finally.

*`μ·We have forwarded all she has explained about their customs||`{.calibre Lush‐Botanist commented.

Survival‐Optimizer thought at the same time:

*`μ·Curious; I would expect a civilization under no preference restrictions to result in much more body diversity than we have||ξ·Perhaps this has driven them towards the morally‐regrettable practice of creating sapient beings to perform tasks their bodies are unsuited for`*

All of the difficulties of multithreaded communication were amplified with multiple individuals involved, and Ryouko was still untangling that when Survival‐Optimizer continued:

*`μ∈!·Yet the capabilities of her body are far beyond what biology and even physics could suggest—your shipboard measurements ≈ abstruse equations‐characterizing‐FTL‐temporal‐consistency|μ∈?·How can a body beyond even an augmented warform be so short and thin|ο?·Is their technology yet unknowable to you, Lush‐Botanist`*

One of the alien\'s two eyes watched Ryouko as they said this---a meaningful piece of body language even for the Cephalopods. Indeed, this was the first she had heard of any \"measurements\".

Lush‐Botanist responded:

*`μ·Even more abstruse, I argue, though I know 3n79lRl⊃Universe‐grasping's perplexity better now|μο∪·Low‐grade reality‐distortion, as you predicted|ο∪·In its technical workings, yes, but we are learning about its role in Human life—for example, we have surmised‒73% that Shizuki Ryouko⊃??? and Clarisse⊃??? currently require reality‐warping to survive`*

It didn\'t take a detailed understanding of Cephalopods for Ryouko to realize they were talking around her. What was interesting was that they were doing it in front of her---did they think she didn\'t care? Or did it just not matter?

*`||ο·Ill tidings for peace`*

There was a brief telepathic silence.

*`·There will be time to consider such matters at length soon—as there is no immediate urgency, Shizuki Ryouko⊃??? and Clarisse⊃??? may as well take some time to adapt to their new surroundings|ৡ·We will meet again in one local‐day`*

It folded all of its arms in front of it in the gesture of farewell, then turned and ambled away with a slight rumbling.

Lush‐Botanist turned to Ryouko.

*`μ·Survival‐Optimizer strongly opposed accepting Akemi Homura⊃Divine‐seeking's request to retrieve you|ν·In the meeting tomorrow, do not be afraid to speak—administrator‐specialists are garrulous and can manage many simultaneous threads`*

With that disturbing tidbit of Thinker politics imparted, they started heading towards a waiting tramcar. Some of the nearby crowd realized that their conversation was over and started sending her and Clarisse greetings and empathize‐open requests. She returned tentative replies to all of it, including passing along some messages from Clarisse, though she declined to read anyone else\'s pref‐spec---it was too mentally taxing, and she had yet to figure out how to avoid running the full comprehension process. She would have to ask about that later.

To her surprise, Feathered‐Defender didn\'t rejoin them. Instead, she spotted the creature swimming with other penguins in a nearby pond, calling shrilly.

Then she saw the other animals around the pond and Clarisse poked her mentally, so that she turned and stopped dead in her tracks. There, at what had been the edges of her peripheral vision, was unmistakably a giraffe, just making its way through the tall grass. She was confident no amount of convergent evolution could reproduce all those details.

*`·This habitat is populated by species from the Milky Way, collected by Consensus/Thinker‐Preserving—part of our agreement with them specifies that they bring back whatever specimens they can, particularly if the species is in serious danger from combat operations|·This creature is popular, but unfortunately lonely—we were told it was recovered from a Human preserve, but that its companions had perished`*

Now that she looked around, she could plausibly identify several of the grass species, and a squirrel‐like rodent that skittered by. Not as definitely as the giraffe, but all were from colony worlds that had fallen to the aliens.

It was a disorienting revelation, and she had to pull herself away from the giraffe, lurching towards the tram, which started moving after she seated herself aboard.

At first, the inside of the tram frankly wouldn\'t have looked out of place on a human colony, if perhaps a bit too round, and with a profusion of support poles. Next to her, Lush‐Botanist wrapped her arms around two support poles.

Then the walls of the tram shimmered and what had been simple windows seemed to expand outward, until she could see everything in mesmerizing panorama.

The landscape looked more natural than artificial, with the grasses near the tram stretching into deciduous forest behind, curving back into the cylinder overhead. As she looked, telepathic machines fed her location data, revealing a handful of residences and other facilities hidden in the landscape.

The spectacle was mind‐bending. Two and four‐winged birds swirled in the air above her, soaring freely between all angles of the cylinder. All manners of animals wandered through the grass, most visible only in infrared, but she saw a few star‐pronged deer browsing at the edges, accompanied by a great orange sloth sniffing the air, slightly smaller than an infantry exosuit. Wasn\'t that...?

*Yes,* Clarisse thought. *It\'s a predator. Very unusual to see them standing together like this.*

She thought about that, then asked Lush‐Botanist.

*`∪·This is a managed ecosystem|∪·We wish to maintain species, but not unnecessary suffering|∪·We have done what we can to obviate predation and manage population`*

To Ryouko that was a strange idea, though she supposed humans had themselves suppressed the instinct of pet cats to hunt birds. But those were pets, and they still hunted mice.

She was still turning that thought over in her mind when the sloth stood up and bellowed, a puff of... something yellow rising from its back. A Cephalopod appeared out of the grass behind it, looking for all the world like a tourist.

They pulled into their arrival stop a few seconds later, still in view of the tableau.

When she had imagined an alien space colony, she had imagined holograms and machinery and metamaterials, all arrayed towards some industrial or military purpose. She hadn\'t imagined striding down a dirt path near a braying sloth, the breeze sifting the crown feathers of an array of green birds peering down at her.

Perhaps she should have, she realized. It was as much a demonstration of technological mastery as the holograms would have been.

They traced their way around the edge of a small hillock, and a residence tower came into view, sand‐white and carved into a spiral around the hill. Circular doorways opened onto tenuous grey ramps downward, seemingly without regard for efficiency or even safety; there were no railings.

Her own room was right at the bottom, and the door that slid open led to a set of accommodations that were broadly similar to those on board the ship.

There had been a few adjustments, though. The room was noticeably cooler and less humid than the surroundings, the chairs were smaller and flatter, and there were no tentacle poles. There was also a small table on the side, complete with visualization platform. It was difficult to tell which changes were intended for her.

Lush‐Botanist drew her attention.

*`μ·I will be available if you need me, but for now I will place this body in storage|ν·You may explore this entire habitat without restriction, but /Ahimsa‐extending encourages you to rest and maintain your neural structures before the upcoming discussion|ν+·Feathered‐Defender will be staying at a nearby rookery, and welcomes your company|μ+·Do you have any immediate requests?`*

---and Peace‐cultivating and the others from the ship were busy consulting with the Tentacle, as she well knew.

*\|\|\|μ·I\'m alright, thanks,* she thought.

The alien made the gesture of farewell, and the door closed behind her.

Ryouko sat next to the window and wondered what to do now. Resting was reasonable but, well...

She looked outside, at a pair of float‐frogs lounging in a pool of water.

She supposed it wouldn\'t hurt to gather a few memories for Asami.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As promised, by the next day, the Administrators of /Ahimsa‐extending had gathered on‐station, ready for Ryouko to meet with them.

In the interim, there had been time for her to take in the sights---including the artificial night, with its projected views of the depths of space---as well as review what she could about Tentacle government. As might be expected, governance systems varied drastically by Tentacle, but the members of /Ahimsa‐extending cared relatively little about politics, preferring to indulge privately in nature‐adjacent hobbies. Hence, they were content to leave administration to the administrator‐specialists, the few individuals born with an inclination to the role, who then self‐modified even further.

The administrators had no particular need to meet physically, or to even be embodied. However, /Ahimsa‐extending members carried a meaningful preference for physical interaction, even if there was no great purpose to it.

Ryouko had to wonder: what, in the end, distinguished this from the human need for companionship and contact? Why was this not an emotion?

When it was time to leave, Peace‐cultivating met her at her door, guiding her to the meeting site. It was a small, but unexpected gesture, so she asked the alien about it as they stepped onto the waiting tramcar, no different from any other she had ridden the day before. The answer was embarrassingly simple: they had known from *her* pref‐spec that it would make her feel better, and /Ahimsa‐extending considered harmonizing with the preferences of other sentient life to be their most important trait.

For a short while afterward, she looked out over the grasslands of the habitat, charmed by a flock of small birds that flew along with the tram.

As they entered the forested half of the habitat, the milieu changed considerably. Where there had been grass and sunlight there were now only trees, growing denser as they went, branches reaching right up to the vehicle itself, but turning away, as if dissuaded by some invisible force.

The meeting site was nestled deep within, in a section of the map covered in water, labeled \"waste reprocessing area\". It was easy to wonder why they would meet in a place like that, but she was quickly preoccupied with the changing scenery. The ground grew soggy and the humidity climbed sharply, as the species of trees began to change. The branches moved higher and higher, the trunks growing thicker and thicker, until Ryouko had to crane her neck to see the tops. By then the trunks were meters across.

Then the tracks entered water, dark and brackish, and the hulking tree trunks branched into wide, ground‐tapping roots, and she realized that these weren\'t quite Earth trees---Earth had trees of this size, but none that grew in water. Perhaps Asami would recognize them.

The ground didn\'t entirely disappear. Instead, the water became shot through with suggestions of roots, the air above foaming slightly and warm. Something about it unsettled her, and as she took a more careful look, whispers in the back of her mind suggested the answer. The roots were not entirely natural; they called it nurture‐wood, and in other spectrums she could see glimmers in the water of what looked like data cable, nanite slush, storage crystal...

When the doors slid open, a rush of wet air greeted her, smelling of algae and plant, yet not as... pungent as she expected. Standing up, she found a bare rock platform in the water, shot through with faint blue storage crystal and barely two meters across. On the other side a small metal dinghy waited for her, lacking any visible means of propulsion.

As she stepped aboard, the boat barely even budging, she took the opportunity to put her hand on one of the tree trunks, nearly three times as wide as her boat. It was slimy to the touch, and cool, but she could feel the slight vibration of something moving underneath.

To her surprise, Peace‐cultivating stepped directly into the water, his robes reacting to the water contact by shrinking and clinging to his lower limbs like a wet suit. His metal ornaments glinted underwater.

*`·We are suited to the water|·You may remain in the boat`{.calibre he thought, and demonstrated by gliding along smoothly with her boat, which was now being pushed along by an anomalous current in the water, leading her slowly towards a particularly dense and dark group of trees.

No, not just dark---they wove together in front of her, forming a cylinder that stretched upward to the invisible sky, far beyond all the other trees, and between the narrow gaps she could see total black, in every spectrum.

But below, in the roots, there was a gap in the wood, just as black, and as they drew nearer, she couldn\'t help but brace herself. It felt as if she were stepping into a void, even if the telepathic messages insisted it was only a \"privacy field\".

The other side left her blinking in confusion, with the smell of salt in her nostrils.

The ground was submerged in water, swirling silently underneath the faintly glowing walls. Here, the water was warm with an unknown chemical process, occasionally shimmering as it caught the light.

The walls were themselves supposedly more nurture‐wood, though now it looked more like smooth rock. Large symbols shone through on those walls, twice as tall as she was, phosphorescent, blue and green and yellow. Translations were provided to her from the old Thinker logographic script. The most important glowed through the water in front of her, ghostly‐white. It said: Here we meet; here we optimize for the good of all.`

And when she looked up, she could see the walls blackening up into the distance, until she could not see the end.

The Thinkers arrayed themselves in circles, standing silently with arm‐limbs tucked in ornamented robes. The half‐dozen Administrators were the inner circle, giants as tall as the symbols on the walls, bulbous protrusions on the backs of their heads attached to hanging vines, though she could see no port. Other, smaller Thinkers formed an outer circle---Peace‐cultivating separated from her and joined them.

As her dinghy arrived in the middle, she nearly startled at a scrabbling motion, and what looked like several small lobsters moved out from underneath her, glassy eyes bulging out of the water, glowing faint green.

She could see them scanning her on several parts of the EM spectrum, before they sidled away back into the water, single‐file.

She couldn\'t help but feel out of place. She and her boat were clearly incongruous within the crowd of large and even *larger* aliens, all of whom had turned to look at her.

Then she was assailed by empathize‐open exchange requests, and it was all she could do to keep herself from being overwhelmed by the computational load. She could have simply skipped empathize‐opening with some of the aliens, but then what kind of representative of Humanity would she be? She couldn\'t turn down the free chance to understand all her questioners.

As the torrent of telepathy subsided, she noticed a sense of anticipation---they were waiting for her to finish processing. Was she being slow?

That thought only made her anxious, and she resisted the temptation to hide her face in embarrassment. She had nothing to be ashamed of, she told herself.

Survival‐Optimizer motioned to speak, raising the two outermost tendrils of his mouth in the traditional gesture. It struck Ryouko as an uncannily human touch, among all the surrealness.

*`ৡ·Let us begin|μ·I will not dispute Shizuki Ryouko⊃???'s sincerity with regard to her key assertions, though there remains room for both strategic deception and reality‐distortion|ξ·Our updated models strongly suggest‒88% that we and the Consensus have been complicit in the mass extermination of sapients—that we have failed in our goals|ν·Our updated models suggest‒43% a breach of Consensus, with exponentially unpredictable and negative possibilities—action must be taken to determine the truth, and we must alert our allies|μ+·Deception which, in most predicted scenarios, would be understandable given her species' circumstances`*

Another administrator, FTuNStB⊃Species‐harmonizer, immediately replied:

*`||ξ·The potential truth of our complicity is painful to contemplate—reciprocity demands that we exact a punishing price|ν·Gathering verified information about the Humans and /Thinker‐preserving will be critical, but it will be difficult to send further agents into the Milky Way without allied help—/Thinker‐preserving allocates much more to intelligence than we do|ο·Public accusation may be useful but may provoke dangerous response, should only be done when no other option`*

A third administrator, T17SlU2⊃Thousand‐blooms, added to the chorus:

*`||ξ·Reciprocity may not be an important concern, relative to concrete matters, and the survival of sapients|ν+·Allied help should be sought without hesitation|ν·We should bring the matter to Consensus/Comprehending, Consensus/Truth‐seeking, and Consensus/Star‐faring|ο·We should not be so hasty in dismissing the value of accusation: we can confront them with only minor issues, and monitor their responses ≈ release the prey to catch the predator`*

A ripple of disagreement passed through the network, with several of the administrators making gestures of dismissal, using a forelimb to pantomime slapping something away.

Yet another administrator, 1NbCb9W⊃Cooperator, spoke:

*`νοৡ!·These suggestions do not go far enough|μ+·We must treat this matter with overriding urgency, given the costs to Ryouko's species, and to ourselves|ξ·We should also inform Consensus Core of our suspicions directly, perhaps without revealing the source of our information|ν+·Thus, we should consult with our allies on more than just intelligence, and prepare an armed response for all future outcomes|ξ+·In strange times, it is valuable for all trustworthy actors to have as much information as possible ≈ the left tentacles align with the right`*

Ryouko was beginning to lose track of the varying conversation threads, even with Clarisse helping, packaging the information into temporally distinct chunks as best she could. All the administrators spoke at once, discussing every topic simultaneously, sometimes in ways that intersected each other, and Ryouko quickly found a sense of paralysis wash over her, her eyes darting over the administrators and the other attendees, who seemed to be mostly an audience.

She took a stabilizing breath, and decided: rather than try to consider it all at once---including the numerous threads discussing detailed Tentacle diplomacy, espionage, and other reactions---she would focus on the narrow topics that involved *her*. Cooperator\'s proposal to inform the Consensus Core quickly gained steam, with those in attendance averring that if they could get the other Tentacles to join them, the unprecedented nature of multiple Tentacles making an accusation would be sufficient to gain credibility---but convincing the other Tentacles to take such a large step would require showing Ryouko and Clarisse to them. And at that point was there any reason not to show them to Consensus Core? It would be admitting to some technical violations of Thinker‐Preserving\'s mandate to conduct the war, but did anyone really care about such things under the circumstances?

It seemed Lush‐Botanist had been right---they would indeed be brought before Consensus proper.

*ξ·We will be willing to meet with any party you need us to, if it\'s a matter of proving our sincerity\|ξ+·As long as our safety is assured, Ryouko thought, when she had girded herself enough to say something. As you know, it is a matter of our species\' survival---self‐interested though it is, I must implore you to exert all efforts to stop /Thinker‐Preserving\'s genocide\|ξ+·Your resources far exceed ours*

She and Clarisse had been given plenty of time to reflect on what they had seen, and the sheer magnitude of the Cephalopod diaspora. As Clarisse had put it, bringing even a single Tentacle unambiguously to "their side\" would be an incredible coup---a chance at several, or the Consensus Core itself, was something they had to grab with both hands. This was, quite possibly, the most important thing she would ever do, and she found herself shivering with the effort of containing her emotion. If they were monitoring her physiology, as she was sure they were, they would doubtlessly notice.

It was strange; battle was easier for her than this. Was this how combat felt for Asami?

The response from Survival‐Optimizer came in a moment:

*`ξ·Your offer is appreciated, both of you, but we must exercise caution|ξ+·Reality‐warping technology or not, you can empathize‐open our pref‐specs, and know how highly we would prioritize saving your species, as we have saved so many others|μ👁·We do not have a grasp of your or your species' reality‐warping technology, nor have you been willing to share—you present a risk to both us and our allies, one that is very difficult to model`*

It felt a bit patronizing, perhaps, to hear one\'s species treated like another exotic animal to rescue, but Ryouko had seen Ahimsa‐extending\'s resources, even devoted only to peace. This was not the time for pride, and the response was as positive as she could have expected from Survival‐Optimizer---but she had to address the topic of reality‐warping.

Activity on the other topics slowed, and a sense of anticipation in the telepathic side‐channels made clear that the group was listening carefully for what she had to say. Even some of the non‐administrators turned their eyes towards her---including, of course, Peace‐cultivating.

She clenched her hands for a moment, then focused herself, remembering the answer she and Clarisse had rehearsed for this exact kind of question.

*ξ·We understand that some information must be provided to facilitate trust\|\|μ·We are unsure how much information I can truly share, since my species\' social structures do not have the predictability of yours, and we have been given no guidance, so we can only exercise our own judgment\|π∈·This is not a technology, but rather something that has been with us since we first gained sapience\|π+∈·We have used it without really understanding it\|π+∈·It seems to have some connection to sapience and to emotions, and to what you would call instability in pref‐specs*

It was difficult to miss the telepathic stir this caused, with several of the administrators even making physical gestures of surprise. Ryouko held her figurative breath, asking Clarisse to keep her body language muted. She had made a rather glaring omission, but she simply couldn\'t tell them about the Incubators. She doubted the Thinkers wanted to hear about a third alien species that claimed to be universal in scope, and she *knew* they didn\'t want to have their memories wiped by Kyubey after being told about it.

But would they notice the omission? Were they capable of proving her wrong?

Survival‐Optimizer was again the one to respond to her:

*`||μ·I hope in time our two species may build enough trust to share all such information safely|π!·That is an extraordinary set of claims|π+·What you say is not impossible, but would be very surprising—though our understanding of the principles involved here, and their connection to sapience, is very limited|π+∪·We have already forsworn careless usage of this technology, precisely because it distorts physical laws and damages mathematical guarantees|π+∪·Such a system can only destroy all predictability, endangering not only Consensus but the universe itself|π+👁?·Could your species stop using reality‐distortion technology if asked`*

*That* was a driving question, one that Ryouko and Clarisse had both wished they could avoid. The Cephalopods had, ostensibly, started the war to stop Humanity from \"reality‐warping\", but it wasn\'t clear if Humanity *could*. The demons were a real threat, one that magical girls supposedly existed to face, but it was clear the Cephalopods had no such problem---she had yet to detect any hint of miasma here. Moreover, the only way Ryouko and Clarisse could possibly imagine to eliminate magic was to remove human emotion, and all existing magical girls.

The Incubators would never allow that, of course.

*μ·I must warn you of something else, then\|μ+·I believe based on my last combat experience near /Thinker‐Preserving\'s pulsar mines that they have identified me individually, or at least my reality‐warping powers\|μ+·They may use this to undermine trust, claiming I am a known and potent threat using my reality‐warping powers to mislead or corrupt you\|\|\|\|\|π·We know of no way to do so*

A loaded set of statements: the former they felt she would have to confess at some point, and the latter was... at least approximately true.

Cooperator commented:

*`ξ∪·In your presence, no argument is logically complete, a crisis of facts|ξ+·Even now, our instruments detect low‐level physical irregularities|ξ∪·No solution converges absolutely when viewed from the outside|ν+·Only direct demonstration to other Tentacles will convince|π·We will leave this topic for now, but will request scientific study of your powers|π+·Consensus/Comprehending will be the best equipped`*

Ryouko neglected the threads about scientific study, which would be interpreted as not wanting to commit---which was true. She admitted being curious what the aliens would find, but the prospect of being an alien lab specimen made her nervous, at best---and Clarise made sure not to hide her physiological reaction.

To her relief, no one pressed her on the matter, instead focusing on the other topic, which she did not yet fully understand. Fortunately, the discussion clarified: in the presence of reality‐distortion and with so limited information, anything was theoretically possible, including Ryouko maliciously altering everyone in her vicinity. Given their safeguards---which they did not elaborate to her---it was *unlikely*, and they were willing to take a minute risk, even to the point of meeting her in person---but that might not extend to all factions and observers.

It was a head‐spinning way of looking at things, but something she could grasp, and she couldn\'t even say they were wrong---if Clarisse van Rossum were here instead of her, who knew what she could do?

When one of them asked what exactly Ryouko\'s reality‐warping powers were, and what /Thinker‐preserving would accuse her of, she was forced to admit her role at Orpheus, and in the destruction of the pulsar mines.

Survival‐Optimizer commented:

*`μ!·A truly unexpected level of power|μ+∈?·You said you forced the fleet back through the wormhole—into a local star or singularity|μ+∈·We were told the fleet was destroyed`*

Ryouko thought back to, and Clarisse played back, her memories of the incident. She remembered perceiving the ships, still clearly intact, on the other side of the wormhole, even after she was done, even as the wave of exhaustion had washed over her.

*\|μ·I did not destroy them\|μ·It is a strange discrepancy*

*`|μ·More mysteries, then|μ·A lie about this could have profound implications—this truth may become a great ally`*

It was obvious that what she said had again greatly perturbed the aliens, and the tenor of the conversation around her reflected that, filled with discussion of *uncertainty* and *unprecedented* and contingencies*. For a few minutes she sat there, quietly absorbing the threads around her, fielding a handful of minor questions about her species---no, reality‐warping was not a universal phenotypic trait, yes, as far as she knew, all humans had similarly variable pref‐specs, though Clarisse added that some human‐made AIs might not. And yes, the Human government would welcome peace, particularly with those who knew nothing of the atrocities committed by /Thinker‐Preserving.

She felt some of the tension leave her; these were much easier topics.

In the last case, Ryouko even had a message to relay: Tomoe Mami\'s message to the aliens, sent during the pulsar mission. There, it had fallen only on deaf ears, but here the beseeching tone, emphasizing the unjust, genocidal nature of the war, served to highlight many of Ryouko\'s claims, and her own appeal earlier. It also gave her some time to breathe, using Mami\'s words rather than her own.

Finally, Survival‐Optimizer thought:

*`μ·We have agreed to dismiss you for now, to avoid wasting your time|μ+·There may be other questions for you later|ξ·It will likely interest you to know that it was I who insisted agents be sent to try to contact, confine, and collect you at the pulsar, as Akemi Homura⊂Divine‐seeking had already given us knowledge of your powers|ξ+·She predicted you would arrive at a certain set of coordinates in deep space after the pulsar detonation, but we were not confident, and it was an opportune chance to test the limits of her predictions of the future|π?·You do not share Divine‐seeking's ability to predict the future, do you`*

*\|\|\|\|π·I do not*

Ryouko, not knowing what else to say to that, signaled her boat to leave, sending more lobsters skittering, and took one last look at the pool, with its array of aliens.

Then the boat carried her away.

Her thoughts turned towards a different angle.

She was only here thanks to a series of contrivances, Homura\'s plots and the efforts of a faction of a faction of the Cephalopods. Soon, Consensus Core would be told she was here, and thereby the enemy would be told too. Would they allow her to return home? Would even Ahimsa‐extending? Was she marooned, grief cubes dwindling, in another galaxy?

Was that the price of her wish?

> Governance eschatological studies have long expected that thanks to the nature of exponential growth, any encounter with a materially‐superior civilization would be an encounter with a vastly*‐superior civilization. Unfortunately for the hopes of military planners, what information I have been given about the Thinker Consensus fails to contradict this notion.

> Thinker population in the Andromeda galaxy is remarkably sparse, two orders of magnitude less than the Governance average per unit area, and thus eight less than even the most conservative estimates of maximal developed population density, in which a hypothesized civilization avoids extensive space habitats, hyperdense planning, or uploading. This observed sparsity is despite the fact that the Thinkers are clearly capable of all of those population practices, and at least some Tentacles willingly adopt them.
>
> This seemingly strange paradox is explicable in light of alien history, society, and galactic context. The Thinkers emerged from a stringent population bottleneck into a Triangulum galaxy devoid of sapient competition, and with a societal structure that encouraged fragmentation and separation. Once it was clear that the galaxy was empty and when FTL technology had been sufficiently developed, the Consensus rapidly moved to divide Triangulum between just over fifty tentacles, each of which had relatively minute populations.
>
> This arrangement has since expanded into the much larger, neighboring Andromeda galaxy, and after the intervening millenia the combined sapient Thinker population is in excess of one trillion, and each of the now hundred‐or‐so Tentacles has an average population only somewhat smaller than Governance, with access to the resources of one percent of a larger galaxy. In comparison, Humanity holds less than one‐thousandth of a percent of the Milky Way.

> Nearly three‐quarters of the Thinker population is disembodied, existing only on electronic servers, with very wide variance between Tentacles.

> First‐time watchers of a Directorate session will be forgiven for a bit of initial confusion. Gone are the staid office meeting rooms of the lower committees, replaced by representations of a rotating selection of Humanity's historical centers of power. Throne rooms, UF bunkers, presidential palaces---but the Directorate shows a marked preference for the trappings of monarchy, where the symbolism of the Empty Throne is most potent.

> For it is the symbolism that matters, and is closely adhered to. The throne represents the missing *princeps*, the king who will never again hold sovereignty. The trappings of state represent what Governance lays claim to: that it is the legitimate successor to every* state, superseding them all. It does not shy away from using the symbols of failure, of nations that crumbled in ignominy or bloodshed, because *then*, it can remind the viewer of its own superiority.

> The resistance of the invading Cephalopods to intelligence extraction, even by magical means, is a notorious subject of debate. It has always been understood as a combination of mental incapability, information restriction, and disciplined suicide, but even then, there has been considerable speculation about brainwashing, memory deletion, or mass biological programming. Yet the evidence for any given theory has always failed to be fully conclusive: the telepathic evidence fails to catch more than glimpses of what *may* be true, and biological studies on surviving samples have been inconclusive.

One such aspect is the use of memory and knowledge‐deprived individuals for combat.

The consciousness backups contain everything so in the long‐term nothing is lost. All of this is justified as a necessary defense against human "reality‐warping".

"Penny for your thoughts?"

Asami stirred from her reverie, blinking at the girl who had approached her.

"Sorry, sorry, shouldn't have surprised you," Azrael said, dropping into the seat next to her. "You've just been so quiet this whole trip. Wanted to check in on you."

Asami shrugged, glancing back out the window of their chartered ramjet plane. By now, she had seen far more than she wanted of outer space, but there was still a certain appeal to be found in near‐orbit. The curve of the Earth, the distant contours of the Andes below... it was certainly more worth a look than the entertainment console, at least.

"Just thinking about the last time I was out here," she said, turning back towards the other girl. "We got to be all alone out in the Amazon. Not like this time."

*This* time, those on the plane---the Homura‐related field team of the newly‐christened Task Force Monteagle---were heading out to what appeared to be Homura's Argentinian lab, only recently uncovered. There they were to dig into whatever old leads they could, hopefully before anyone thought to stop by and destroy the evidence.

Though, speaking precisely, it wasn't clear if that was Homura's *only lab, even in the area.

"I can sympathize with how you feel," Azrael said. "The independence of exploring alone or with someone you care about... I'm used to having plenty of time to myself. I guess this just isn't that kind of mission."

Azrael rubbed the back of her neck.

"I guess you can think of it like your time in the military. Get in, do what needs to be done, get out. With much less chance of getting killed, and at least our destination is quite a bit in the wilderness, so you'll get to walk a bit. I look forward to a bit of a flight myself."

Working on the task force was, Asami had realized, a stressful mix of constant vigilance and uncertain dangers. For instance, there was the risk that the conspiracy they were against had enough additional capability to target the task force personally. That meant Asami had been obliged to sweep the plane before takeoff alongside a MagOps security squad, who had "helpfully" related stories of explosive soul gems, auto‐teleporting jet engines, and other obscure attack vectors.

So, when they were all asked to minimize sleep to guard against attacks while airborne, Asami didn't really need to be *told*.

They also needed to move quickly. They needed to gather whatever evidence they could before any enemy conspiracy could outpace them. Whatever chance they had might not last.

An environment like this wasn't really like being in the military. There was an added element of uncertainty, and a lack of opportunity to punch anything. It was hard to imagine anyone coping well. Well, except...

Asami peeked back at Simona, a few rows back, seemingly enthralled by something on her console. *She* seemed fine, as well she might be.

"It's not just about the plants," Asami said. "It's about my choice to be here. I feel... uneasy, like I don't know what I should be doing. Who knows how any of this is going to end? I don't really have any experience with investigations, or with Akemi Homura."

She paused, weighing her feelings.

"I'm not sure how to say this. Now, if something doesn't work out, it's kind of my own fault, so I feel way more nervous. Just listening to Command, or following Ryouko around, was easier. That feels like a terrible thing to say."

Azrael looked down for a moment.

"When I was younger, what they told me was that everyone has feelings like this. It's part of growing up and taking responsibility for yourself. I always thought that it was condescending to put it that way, but there is a kernel of truth to it. Uncertainty is a part of making real decisions. For me, that started the moment I left my home."

On reflection Asami could see a bit of what Azrael meant: comparing someone's problems to your own could seem to be making light of them, even if it probably made them feel less alone.

But, more importantly...

"None of my problems compare to what yours were," Asami said, shaking her head. "I'm not even worrying about Ryouko, which is probably the only thing worth worrying about."

"Maybe," Azrael said, stretching, a strange gesture that seemed to involve numerous back muscles, shuddering her seat.

The rest of the short flight was uneventful, but the conversation had made Asami restless, and she ended up doublechecking the dossiers she had been given about the others on the flight. Most honestly needed no introduction---Simona, Azrael, and Ryouko's aunt, Shizuki Nana. There was also Meiqing, who Nana had taken on as an apprentice. She and Asami had reunited in Mitakihara and, well...

It had been fun enough, even given the circumstances, but it had been strained by Ryouko's alleged death looming over them. Meiqing clearly thought Asami might be delusional.

That and a few others made up the people on the flight. Asami hadn't been given files on the rest of the task force, but she knew it was extensive, and that she knew a few more of the people involved. That would have to do for now.

Their destination was the city of Mendoza in Argentina, close to the Andes. Long ago, its position close to one of the only passes over the mountains had made it a military hub, a key buttress against Brazilian forces to the east. Those days had converted what was once a minor regional capital, the heart of wine country, into a major population center, a legacy that had not entirely dimmed in the centuries since.

Perhaps it should have been difficult to maintain an alert mindset in a place like this, but the military had ingrained in her a perpetual situational awareness, and she found it natural to check her corners and exits as they made their way out of the airport. She still found it an offensive notion, though, the idea of watching for ambushes on Earth.

They wasted no time in heading for the site, using small bursts of magic to keep themselves fresh even beyond what the implants provided. Whatever bags they had would be automatically couriered to hotel rooms they might well never see.

The target lab facilities were outside the city proper, nestled into arid foothills far off the beaten path. The reason for that was obvious, but years ago it had been registered as an "Institute for Environmental Studies", allegedly studying custom biological and implant augmentations for extreme environmental conditions. At its peak, there had been eleven researchers, all of whom had afterward absconded for the colonies and rapidly disappeared. None of it had any official connection to Homura or her Valentin identity.

That meant they were obliged to trek into the hills, along disused paths that had once been used only by drone transports and small buggies. They had all agreed on taking the walk---less conspicuous, and an easy journey for the likes of them, especially in the early morning cool. Even if Azrael kept grumbling about having been grounded---no need to draw any extra attention to their group.

Asami wasn't usually a desert kind of person, but she found herself appreciating the occasional insect or hidden bird, the scraggly plants hurrying to fix their last bits of carbon for the night.

There wasn't time to take notes or sit and watch, as she would have preferred, so instead she bookmarked the images in her memories, casting her eyes at all she could. The thing about being on Earth was, someone had almost certainly catalogued everything, far better than her.

Still, it would be fun.

The laboratory came into view just as the sun was starting to peek over the horizon, nestled in a valley between two dusty hills. As they came over the ridge, they could see light scintillating off the facade of the three‐story building, lonely behind a low permacrete wall. There were no other structures, and a small loading dock on the right backside had grown covered with dirt.

It was not the building itself that sparkled with light, but the sheet of transparent ceralymer that covered it. As a building that still had potential use, it had been sealed upon its decommissioning, to protect the building and its environment from each other. Such measures could be effective for years, but it had *been* years, and she could spot some soil gathering on top of one of the roofs. Still, the condition of the building looked acceptable.

They fanned out over the terrain. Azrael was now free to fly and took full advantage, moving into the air with great flaps of her wings, enough to draw glances from those who weren't used to seeing it.

They had the official maps of the building to plan their approach, assuming they were reliable. Entry points were a door on the roof, the loading dock, and the main entrance. The building's power systems were near the loading dock, so a team would head there to restart things, but the fastest route to the labs was the main entrance---and that was where Asami would head.

First, though, Azrael flew a tight loop around the building, touching down on the exposed section of the roof after a few preliminary scans. The area seemed clear.

*Just some nesting birds,* Azrael thought, referring to the ceralymer damage. *Not sure how they got in. Oh, they're not happy to see me.*

Asami took a glance at the building as she moved, spotting a few ground doves dive‐bombing Azrael as she hastened into the building. It was fascinating behavior, if she had more time to look.

Asami moved in with her group: Meiqing, Nana, and Christina San Miguel, a magitech specialist affiliated with Science Division. A small laser cutter sufficed to get them through the ceralymer, which flexed unhappily as they carved out a door‐sized sheet and pushed it aside.

There was no need to wait for the power to come online. Meiqing reached into a panel on the side of the double doors and toggled the manual override, allowing them to push the translucent doors apart.

The doors moved easily despite the years, revealing a narrow atrium leading up to a glass‐and‐steel staircase. The walls were standard holographic‐emitting, and the empty space in front of them suggested where there might have once been chairs and a table in a waiting area.

One thing was immediately obvious: someone had been here before.

Whoever it was hadn't been particularly subtle about it, leaving exposed wiring and wall terminals right inside the atrium, wall panels on the floor next to the seating area. It was exactly where one would try to gain access to a building's systems, if one were unable to go any deeper and didn't care about secrecy.

They were instantly on higher alert, each of them performing respective scans of the area as Christina moved for the terminals. A few seconds later, confirmation came through from one of the other teams that building power was coming back online in a moment. They didn't transform, yet.

*Can confirm systems have been activated at least once before,* they were told. *No timestamps, but I can tell.*

Of course, a past startup should have triggered an alert on a Governance monitoring system somewhere. The fact that it evidently hadn't, or had been ignored, had obvious implications.

They paused a moment in anticipation, waiting for reactivated traps or system failures, and when none manifested the building's internal mirror array came to life, bathing the lobby in cool dawn sunlight.

Christina transformed, summoning a gossamer blue‐and‐white wand, translucent with bright runes, and planted it into one of the open terminals, where it passed intangibly straight through the optical screen. A moment later, a cable snaked out from behind the terminal and installed itself on Christina's wrist port, a rather more standard method of accessing the network.

They waited for a conclusion, Asami peering up at the building's upper floors, where frosted glass doors denied access to unauthorized personnel.

*Our predecessors were more careful about hiding their electronic traces than their physical,* she thought. *I wouldn't even be able to follow this without magic‐based tracing. It's a bit strange that they tried to get in here, though. Even without a building AI managing security, you'd want direct hardware access, TCF breach or not.*

She frowned, and some kind of magic eyepiece appeared over one eye. With implants an eyepiece seemed superfluous, but when it came to magic, who was Asami to say?

*The building datastores have been completely wiped, and probably not by whoever got here first. Not too surprising; it'd be silly for Homura to just leave her secrets out in the open. The question is whether any other measures were taken. Otherwise, a skilled mage might get the information anyway.*

The eyepiece disappeared and she disconnected from the terminal.

*I need hardware access. Let's go.*

"Hardware access" meant reaching the building's computing cluster, hidden in the building's basement with the other hardware and cooling systems. So they moved onward, deeper into the facility. Default‐mode security doors opened at their approach, revealing abandoned hallways and lab space, stripped bare of important equipment, leaving only the self‐assembling furniture, desks, and fixtures embedded in the building itself.

They kept their senses and sensors on edge, checking around every corner as they passed. If there was even anything left in the facility, it had likely been picked over by their unknown third party. Their only hope to find anything here was a magic sweep, which could be done later.

They headed down a flight of stairs, entering what should have been hardware storage. Instead, there was more lab space, accompanied by extensive fluid and chemical piping. The maps were wrong, and given what Simona had told them, it was possible to guess that this was where the growth vats had been.

Asami looked back at Simona. Did it bother her, descending into what might very well be her birthplace?

It was hard to tell---the girl had her professional mask on. Asami was tempted to probe Simona's feelings a little, but now simply wasn't the time. They had a secret lab to investigate.

Most of the building's computing hardware had been stripped out, leaving a cavernous server room that was nearly all empty, save from rows and rows of sealed connection docks. Only in the far back were a few boxes still in place, large, metal, and austere---the residual systems that maintained the building itself.

Such hardware would have no information left about the former lab or its operations, but Christina marched forward purposefully, plugging herself into the machines as quickly as possible. With magic, it was possible to find even the ghosts of the machines that had once been there.

Yet Christina soon shook her head unhappily.

*This isn't just the usual clean‐up job. My magic seeks are failing. I've only heard about this kind of thing in power study. Some magical girls can block clairvoyance. A few can block it even from the future. One of the best kinds of magical security. But that would mean...*

*There's only a handful of such magical girls,* Nana commented. *That alone is useful information.*

*Can you break that kind of seal?* Christina thought. *It's a kind of magic, after all.*

*I've yet to figure out how to project it into the past,* Nana thought. Or attach it to someone else's magic. My abilities are a very blunt tool. Though we can make the try.*

*Maybe I can contribute,* Simona thought, neutrally. *More power couldn't hurt.*

As the others gathered in front of the servers, Nana raising her hands and scowling, Asami found her attention drawn off towards one of the side walls.

It was a nondescript section of the room, a simple white wall which would have once been inaccessible behind metal boxes, now gloomy in the dim light.

She stepped forward, certain there was something there.

She had felt something like this once before, in a context that was both very different... and a little similar. That had been in an underground complex on a distant world, a trap set for Sakura Kyouko...

It couldn't be, could it?

No, she realized. It could easily be.

*Shizuki‐san,* she thought. *Nana.*

The others stopped, registering the emotional content of her message.

*What is it?*

*There's something buried inside the wall, like what we encountered on X‐25.*

She felt a chill on her spine as Nana and Meiqing's attention shifted immediately to where she was indicating. On X‐25 it had been Ryouko who had felt it first, but she had too, in the end, and here they were again, she, Meiqing, and Nana.

This one was smaller, though. Much smaller, small enough that she would never have noticed if they hadn't walked right by it. Perhaps the size of a particularly large grapefruit.

*My powers are very limited when it comes to synthetic walls,* Meiqing thought. *We'll have to take her word on it.*

*We'll need an evac ready before we try anything,* Nana thought. *Damn, if only we had a teleporter.*

Strictly speaking, there wasn't necessarily any rush, not this time, but the last one had been a bomb. Could they afford to wait for backup to arrive? They had the option to go back outside and try from there, but was *that* safe? If it were a bomb, what was the trigger?

Nana made an unhappy gesture.

*It's not just about our safety. We also need to keep whatever evidence we can intact. But until we can be sure about escaping or stopping an explosion, there's simply no guaranteed good option. If we wait outside for a teleporter and a bomb goes off, at least we won't be caught inside with it.*

The details were sorted out quickly: an emergency request was placed to MSY relays in Mendoza for whatever teleporters they might have. The other teams would be withdrawn and their own squad would move to a location outside, behind a hill, where Meiqing would fabricate earthen walls to bunker them down. There they would wait until a suitable teleporter and shield generator arrived.

It was a vexing wait, more so when it stretched out into minutes, then to nearly half an hour. Asami was used to not having the right power or the ability available---in the military, that was all too common. But they were supposed to be specialists here. This was *their* mission, and practically the first thing they had needed to do was call in outside help.

Their reinforcements arrived at length; it turned out they had been forced to pull the best candidate teleporter out of a costume performance in a neighboring town, and she had only agreed to come once they explained how serious the situation was.

*I was supposed to be getting facturas with my partner,* the girl in question huffed, appearing inside their earthen bunker with a shower of sparkles. *I'm only back on Earth for a week. But the situation is serious, yes?*

All they had told her was that the situation was TCF breach‐related. Which was still more than Governance or the MSY wanted to admit, but it would have been impossible to avoid saying *something*, and you didn't want people's imaginations filling in the blanks.

*We think we've detected some kind of trap,* Nana thought. *Designed to ensnare anyone who passed by. There was something similar on X‐25. We were lucky Miss Nakihara was here to notice it at all.*

X‐25 had already been blamed on the TCF breach conspiracy, and Governance had already agreed to tying it into to whatever happened here.

*Traitors, honestly,* the teleporter said. *It is hard enough to fight the squid as it is. I am glad to assist.*

It was time to proceed.

They returned to the datastore room with a single teleport, the journey dazzling them with a dizzying blast of glowing five‐pointed stars.

They stayed in a tense circle for a moment, senses and sensors casting about over the area. Nothing had changed---still the same dreary computer room, without even holographic walls to interact with.

Asami pointed as best she could at where the thing was. It would be up to the others now.

The barrier generator stepped forward, and with down‐to‐the‐millisecond timing, projected her barrier forward, a web of white light projecting from her palms---right as Simona added her own orange enhancement magic from the side.

They waited on trigger‐alert, the barrier generator glaring at the wall as if it would kill her, barrier pulsing.

*I have it,* the barrier generator thought, finally, meaning that she had sealed the object off and everything seemed fine. No explosion yet, but if it did, she could hopefully absorb it.

The teleporter tapped the ground with a red‐and‐gold stick.

Asami kept her guard up as they shifted, flooding her eyes with sudden morning light. They were half a kilometer away now, and now they could see what the barrier enclosed, an excavated ball of metal and permacrete, hanging in shimmering white above sunbaked rock.

Nana's hands glowed purple, and for a barely perceptible moment the barrier flickered, letting in a flare of Nana's magic that outshone the sun itself.

The barrier sealed shut and they waited, breaths held.

Nothing happened, and now their sensors could pierce the veil.

*No bomb,* Nana thought. *But a datacrystal.*

The barrier generator lowered the hunk of wall to the ground, releasing it a moment later. Technologically, the stealth device itself would be quite a find, but why would there be a hidden data crystal in the wall?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*It's a surveillance recording,* Christina thought, her wand inserted into the metal.

*A surveillance recording? Of what?* Asami asked.

Instead of answering directly, Christina gestured at Meiqing.

*Give me a second,* Meiqing thought.

The ground beneath them rumbled, and then with a loud snap a dome of dirt slammed into place around them, swallowing them in darkness, except for the glow of Christina's wand.

As good a way to block prying eyes as any other. The teleporter and barrier generator they had recruited were still nearby, but had been lured away for a debriefing. Other than that, the principals were here: Nana, Simona, Azrael.

Christina's wand came to life, and a hologram projected out into the space between them. It took a moment for Asami to recognize it as a recording of a building interior, likely the same one they had just left. Not much was discernable---it could have just been a random hallway.

Four maintenance drones skittered into view, the size of small dogs and spider‐legged. They looked slightly odd, a bit bulkier than what Asami was used to, but nothing she would have looked three times at. They stopped in place.

*"Intercepted tightbeam audio transmission"* appeared at the top of the hologram.

"It is absolutely galling how she keeps managing to do this," a girl's voice said, an overlay arrow appearing above one of the drones to indicate the speaker. "*We're* supposed to be the ones with the plan. How can she keep out‐predicting us?"

Another girl's voice replied from another drone:

"The calculations are not perfect. You know that, and you know who we're facing down. I hate it too, but she must have some superior method of prediction."

A third voice now:

"Better than *her*? Better than Laplace's Demon itself? The only way I could see that is if that old witch Oriko isn't as dead as they make her out to be. Whatever the case is, I'm sure it certainly isn't some goddess*."

The accent on the last word was disdainful, to say the least.

The second drone groaned.

"We're not doing this again. Look, thanks to her and our other friends we have an incredible advantage, Akemi Homura or not. No one understands computation as well as we do. The resulting flexibility is our edge."

"May it be as you say," the first drone said. "But Akemi Homura is proving much more *flexible* than our mutual enemies. It's only a matter of time before she makes a move on our little backdoor."

"Let them think that's all we have. As long as they think that's how we're getting in."

The last drone finally spoke up:

"We're wasting time here, I'd rather not spend any more time in these drones than I have to. You know how much she hates their limited capacity."

One of the spider drones raised an appendage and an object flashed into the recording above it: an astrolabe, glowing gold, out of nowhere.

Another flash, and the drones were gone.

There the recording ended, leaving the group to blink at each other in the murky dark.

*Where do we even begin with that?* Nana thought. *First off, are we even sure this is authentic?*

They looked to Christina, who didn't respond right away, eyepiece still glowing as her magic worked. The frown on her face got deeper.

*Right,* she thought finally. *I have no reason to think otherwise. Everything validates, and it's even properly authenticated as TCF‐compliant and secure, but get this, it's using one of the* newer protocols, one of the parallel TCFs set up after the recent breach incidents. Specifically, this is the one derived from the Version Two Tactical Computers. At the time this was allegedly recorded, two years ago, those weren't known to be alternate‐branch.*

She looked at Nana, who nodded for her to continue.

*But of course we all know about Homura's involvement in that work. This is likely intended as a calling card, there to make us think she made this recording.*

She paused.

*Of course, how much does this prove it was really her? Well, this recording uses a form of magic‐based validation called retrospection catalysis, which is one of the hardest ones to break. It's not impossible, of course, but for now I would say it's very likely to be her. Ideally, we would wait for MESBH to study it and reach their conclusions, but that will take quite a bit.*

She stopped there, the glow of her eyepiece casting a strange light on her face.

*Well, then we can talk about the contents of the video,* Nana said, shaking her head. *Before we even touch the other stuff, the drones definitely seemed like they were talking to each other, but using tight‐beam audio? If they were remote‐controlled why wouldn't the controllers talk with each other directly? Maybe an AI would know better.*

*I'm more concerned about this Laplace's Demon they're talking about, Meiqing thought. *That's* quite *the name. If it has any truth to it.*

*It would explain why they think they could take on Governance* or Homura,* Simona thought. *I can speak from experience that Homura's ability to predict the future is uncanny. But not perfect, and a real Laplace's Demon would be* perfect.

*The Homura I knew, before New Athens, was pretty far from perfect at predicting the future,* Nana thought. *Still, the conspiracy can't be perfect either, or we would have never had any success against them.*

Asami realized, with some discomfort, that she was probably the only one here who had scoffed at the drones' dismissal of the Goddess. *She* knew that it was a perfectly good explanation for Homura's recent predictive powers.

Did she need to say something? It was possible she didn't have to: after all, Chitose Yuma and Sakura Kyouko would take the idea seriously, even if the others wouldn't.

*The Goddess explanation can't be so readily dismissed,* Asami thought, hiding a cringe. *Homura has the Goddess's other Ribbon, after all. It sounds like the conspirators might even be taking that seriously.*

*Asami‐chan...* Meiqing thought, only to her.

*You may be right,* Azrael thought, to Asami's surprise. *Though if any of them take the idea seriously, it's a wonder they aren't panicking.*

*The drone girls did seem awfully certain of themselves,* Christina commented.

*Someone with a TCF backdoor into Governance would be,* Nana pointed out. *And, it sounds like, some other kind of trump card. The MSY has already enhanced its security procedures, but this just adds more fuel to that fire.*

She sighed, putting a hand to her hand.

*Honestly, we don't need more questions about our security.*

Asami waited a few seconds, but no one else seemed to have anything to say on the subject---at least, not while including her in the telepathy.

*What about the teleportation at the end?* Asami thought. *It kind of looked like one of the drones was casting magic. We could be dealing with some kind of mage with drone‐based magic. Like Patricia von Rohr, though I'm definitely not saying she was involved here.*

*With magic involved, it's nearly impossible to say anything with certainty,* Nana said. *But it does mean we can look through MSY membership records for anyone similar.*

*How likely is that to work?* Asami asked.

In answer, Nana looked at Azrael, whose wings had rustled unhappily.

*Wouldn't have caught most of the rogue colony girls I've had to hunt down,* Azrael thought, reading the cue. *But that doesn't mean we don't try.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, executives of the MSY had been summoned to the Directorate Plenary Chamber.

A golden throne, wide as it was tall, stood atop a dais some five meters wide and a meter high. The back of the throne was composed of dragons in gold leaf, bright like the morning sun, and in front was a gilded podium and a series of cerulean incense burners. Towering columns painted in vermillion red, ten meters high, rose to the domed ceiling, with illustrations of Earth etched into jadeite tiles of ultramarine blue and viridian green. Below, the dias was flanked by additional gold and cerulean incense burners, large enough to fit a person. The finer details were impeccable, every minute ripple of paint rendered as if it had been freshly brushed.

But this Dragon Throne was no mere historical replica. Instead of facing inward, its dragons turned their heads away, their fierce eyes shadowed, their claws clutching not Dragon Pearls but the Core Worlds of Humanity, blue‐green orbs swirling with clouds, finely dusted with the lights of cities and orbiting satellites. The patterns of the ceiling were not mythic creatures but constellations, logos, representations of all that Governance oversaw.

And the Throne, of course, remained Empty.

Kyouko made her way into the chamber, stepping brusquely over the wooden threshold at the front entrance. The setting was arresting in its grandeur, but she focused her attention on the political principals: Kuroi Kana, Tomoe Mami, and Seo Si‐won, standing in the center facing the throne, surrounded by the circular bench where the members of the Directorate would soon be arrayed. Not quite how the throne room of the Forbidden Palace had been arranged, but Governance had its own trappings.

Right on cue, the Directorate Representatives appeared all at once, snapping into place in their seats neither a second late nor early. Today there was a full house, and as the circle of thirteen Representatives gazed pointedly down at them, Kyouko had the opportunity to gauge their questioners---enough time to note that while most were in their usual outfits, some had adapted a bit to suit their surroundings. Science and Technology, for instance, had dropped his usual mad scientist look for a scholar‐bureacrat's robe and finialed cap.

More important, though, were the two Representatives sitting closest to the Empty Throne. The first was Yuma, to the left, occupying her seat as Governance: Magical Girls*. They met gazes, and then Yuma stood up and began making her way down to her MSY fellows. A second later, MG shimmered in to replace her. The symbolic was explicit: today Yuma was representing the MSY, not Governance.

The second key representative, to the right of the throne, was Governance: Public Order*. That position meant he was chairing the meeting. Today, he had swapped modern wear for a robe of white silk brocade, embroidered with the two large black arrows of Governance in front, and additional logos on both of his arms.

Kyouko patted Yuma's head when she arrived beside her, and Yuma made an annoyed noise. The girl was back in her child avatar for the meeting, and she had stuck with her magical girl costume today; her bright pastel green color and cat ear headband made for quite a contrast with the surroundings.

At the appointed time, Public Order brought the session to order.

"I am sure our summons brings no surprise to any of you. While publicly it is important to keep a united front, what we have learned about the TCF breach and MSY internal decision‐making has raised concerns that require meaningful consultation. In this closed session, I hope for a productive discussion and the resolution of key questions, away from too much public attention."

"First, we will discuss the recent security breaches in the TCF, what has happened, what we have found in the investigation, and what we will do moving forward. That will serve as context for the second part of the discussion, where we will discuss the MSY's rogue elements, what the MSY knows about them, and what should be done. Finally, we will talk about MSY decision‐making and the Church of Hope."

Public Order crossed his arms. He had never been the most popular member of the Directorate, not even when the role had been Yuma's, and the current Public Order her Advisory AI. Now that Public Order wore a sharp, authoritative look, he had become the face of some of Governance's less savory aspects, all the subtle means of inhibiting dissent---concealing information, denying access to jobs and resources, and so forth.

"On the topic of security," he said. "The Trusted Computing Framework is intended to serve as a provably Human value compliant, incorruptible foundation for all important computing. However, it is not invulnerable to the application of magic, and we have relied upon you, the MSY, to help us protect ourselves---unknowingly, at first, but consciously since the end of your masquerade. We have never been comfortable with the arrangement; we prioritized cooperation previously, given the Cephalopod threat, but now we find such an arrangement difficult to tolerate."

Yuma moved to the middle of the floor to speak, her reflection murky on the black‐tiled floor.

"I speak in my capacity as a Second Executive of the MSY and Head of Governmental Affairs. The security measures used by the MSY were agreed upon by all parties shortly after we became public, and our previous efforts had been successful for centuries. The issue now is that the threat far exceeds what both we and you considered plausible at the time."

She paused rhetorically, looking around the room to meet the eyes of the Directorate.

"Of course, what was considered plausible was based primarily on our own assessment of the situation, which proved incorrect. We underestimated the prevalence of rogue elements within our own organization, and their willingness to conspire against the common good. That is a matter we will address shortly. As for the current topic of TCF security, my colleague Kuroi Kana, Director of the Black Heart, will discuss previous and existing security arrangements."

She stepped aside, making room for Kana to give her own statement. By now, her unassuming, deliberately inconspicuous demeanor was reasonably familiar in the Directorate chambers, though today she affected a pair of cosmetic glasses, which Kyouko hadn't seen in years.

As Kana stepped forward, a set of stylized diagrams appeared in front of all the members, sheaves of virtual reference materials to accentuate what she was saying.

Kana waited a moment to begin.

"The magical defense of Humanity's computing systems---the MSY's contribution to Governance's information security, both before and after relies on the routine scanning and verification of core computing infrastructure and sapients. The most important of these are the AIs that program other AIs and software, the source from which all computing springs. Intrusion or damage here, at the root of the system, could propagate throughout the entire computing framework, and is the most serious kind of attack. All other attacks, whether by mundane or magical means, would have only limited and temporary effect, and would inevitably be discovered. This is a welcome fact, as it is simply not remotely physically possible to magically monitor all computing systems all the time. Instead we only need to defend the root."

"But the TCF breach *was* an attack on this root, an attack that has demonstrated critical flaws in our existing procedures. The existing regime of routine inspections and verification must be insufficient."

"Analysis of the possible attack vectors has shown that the lack of continuous monitoring is the core problem. Put simply, mages capable of the necessary tasks are rare and needed at the front and this was the primary consideration at the beginning of the war, when these plans were formed in conjunction with Governance. On annual revision, the extra resource expenditure to do better was always deemed unnecessary."

She made a gesture, and a new set of files presented themselves. These displayed graphically how the new inspection procedures would work, changing colors to indicate assessed risk and detected hypothetical attacks. Additional metadata detailed the pairs of magical girls who would now be on continuous rotation, the additional telepathic screening they would undergo, and the novel magical artifacts that would be deployed in conjunction. There would now always be someone on‐site, on all* the sites. In addition, red teams of magical girls and newly‐constructed AIs would now be assigned to look for security holes and suggest improvements, under Black Heart purview.

"Of course, this is much more resource‐intensive than the previous arrangement---we estimate ten new AIs and two hundred magical girl personnel. Military Affairs has already approved our reassignment requests away from the front, as the current period is relatively quiet, but this may have to be reassessed later."

She stopped there, turning the discussion over to questions. The first several questions were purely technical in nature, but the last one was more difficult. It was a moment before Kana responded:

"Unfortunately, we have not yet found definitive evidence of when or where the primary penetration occurred. Our studies suggest that a program of repeated modify‐and‐erase intrusions between audits would have been the most likely approach. Investigation is ongoing, but without firmer evidence it is possible we will never know."

With that resolved, Kana ceded the floor.

One of the Directorate members to their right stirred. This one struck observers immediately as by far the least human member of the Directorate, but the average human struggled to explain *why*. In one sense, she looked like an attractive human, short‐haired, with the same inscrutable ethnicity of many Governance AIs, and the standard I/O eye. In another, her appearances had been carefully adjusted to convey a kind of steely otherworldliness. Sleek, eerie, incorruptible.

Kyouko remembered this same Directorate member in an earlier meeting, open to the public. There, she had spoken about the anger and trauma within the AI community, and about how demand for reinspection by new branch TCF AIs was far outstripping supply.

"The reestablishment of security is only one part of the larger corpus of work that must be completed," *Governance: Artificial Intelligence said, leaning over the railing of gilt bronze. "Those responsible for this atrocity must be captured and brought to justice for their crimes against our very personhoods. We have begun by reexamining databases for manipulation and fabrication, with an eye towards the likely targets of the TCF Conspiracy. As part of this, we have reanalyzed much of the raw data from sector surveys, with the aid of retired and volunteer AIs, in order to shine a light on the dark corners of space where they may have hidden themselves."

Like Kana, she summoned reference material for the attendees, this time focused on a display screen. This screen began with a star map of Governance‐controlled space, with key systems highlighted in green---a standard display familiar to even a schoolchild. It quickly shifted angle, and an additional series of virtual displays appeared nearby, surrounding the central one, depicting individual groups of stars or a system, with one area labeled.

"As you can see, we have already found a number of anomalies: probable planets, interstellar asteroids, and other objects that are missing from the usual catalogs, accompanied by signs of data manipulation and outright fabrication. However, while we have begun resurveying these objects using stealth assets, nothing notable has been uncovered. The sheer number of anomalies potentially indicates an attempt to drown anything of real worth inside a sea of noise, and there is some risk that all of this is mere misdirection. Nonetheless, we have no choice but to pursue all of it. Access to an updating list of these anomalies has been provided to the MSY for consideration."

She paused, looking pointedly at MG, whose face was impassive.

"The potential for something else to be out there in the void is obvious, especially after the recordings that were found at the asteroid," she continued. "For a Directorate Advisory AI to be suborned is an outrage, whatever the reason, but the purpose for which she was used is truly unforgivable."

Suffice to say, the fact that Humanity had murdered an apparent group of Cephalopod negotiators at the dawn of the war was a diplomatic catastrophe of the first order. For it to have been imposed on Humanity by malevolent forces who were now coordinating with the alien invaders... the Directorate, and MG, felt justified rage.

The topic was sensitive enough that it had yet to be made public, nor had it been included in the information dumped onto the internet by the conspiracy. Perhaps it made both sides look bad.

There were fewer questions this time, with most of those interested electing to forward technical suggestions by other channels. There had already been a session for everyone to vent their spleens, and Governance AIs didn't repeat themselves unless they felt it necessary.

Afterward, the current Director of the MSY's Science Division, Seo Si‐won, stepped forward. She was impeccably dressed, hair tied back in a short ponytail, and looked how one might imagine a woman about to enter her fifth century, confident and poised.

Still, Kyouko could see the strain in her posture as she moved towards the center. She hoped she would be alright.

"There is another topic of interest to the Directorate," Si‐won said. "We have achieved some closure on the incident at the Eurydome Institute of Theoretical Gravitonics, thanks to the efforts of Governance investigators. While Lemaître was verified after the incident, the evidence now clearly suggests he was under the influence of the TCF backdoor. Sabotage by the lab AI was always the most likely theory, and there is no longer any dispute about the cause. The more interesting question is motive."

"Of course, Lemaître had the authority and skill to cover his own tracks. But using magic, our own specialists were able to glean that the intentions of the conspiracy may have been two‐fold. Not just to assassinate Shizuki Ryouko, but also the Director, Tao Shaojie, and in so doing severely damage ITG's research. Interestingly, targeting Sakura Kyouko did not seem to be part of the plan."

"The conclusions are not yet finalized, but I do not expect them to change. In my opinion, it is likely this was a deliberate attempt by the conspiracy to sabotage the war effort."

She paused.

"Let's do some questions before we move on to the next topic," she said.

"That is somewhat surprising, isn't it?" Public Order asked, after a moment. "During the recent terrorist attacks, the conspiracy had plenty of opportunity to damage the war effort far more than they did."

It was really more of a comment than a question, and another Representative responded before Si‐won could.

"Remember that they also tried to discredit both us and the MSY in the eyes of the public," *Governance: Public Opinion*---the human Fatimah Mai---said. "That would be difficult to do if they discredited themselves by seriously damaging the war effort."

"Then perhaps their motivations are even more malicious than we suspected," *Governance: Military Affairs* said. "Though I admit there is not much lower to go."

"Indeed," Si‐won agreed. "In response to this and the other incidents, Public Order has instituted a series of measures for improved site security on war‐relevant research institutes across human space. Where the MSY is involved, or where magic‐related research is performed, we have complied, and added our own action plans on top of that."

Si‐won waited a few seconds, tapping her fingers on the side of her leg. Was that impatience or nerves? Kyouko couldn't tell.

"That conveniently brings us to the next topic," Si‐won said, deviating from the prepared statement. "As you know, the Zeus Research Institute was founded in Mitakihara to study magical phenomenon, both in a fundamental sense and, nowadays, at the intersection with high technology. We've made a number of breakthroughs over the past century, but progress since the start of the war has been rather slow. We now believe we know why."

She took a breath before continuing:

"There has been a coordinated campaign of scientific sabotage dating back more than fifteen years, perpetrated as a coordinated effort by the lab AIs themselves to stall progress. Findings were ignored, data was subtly tainted, experimental conditions were modified. Much of the damage is irreversible---tainted or ignored data can perhaps be recovered with serious magical effort, but there is no way to recover from malevolently damaged experiments, other than to run them again. We have been set back perhaps a full decade or more."

Kyouko nodded silently, wishing Si‐won could see her. They had rehearsed what she would say, and discussed all this with some of the Directorate members in advance, but as head of Science Division Si‐won was also responsible for overseeing the institute. For her, it was a terribly personal disaster, and Kyouko knew for a fact that she hadn't slept since the news broke, dealing with the fallout. Her staffers had even called in the MHD on one occasion.

There was a resignation offer still sitting unacknowledged on the Leadership Committee's agenda. Perhaps, if there was a political need for someone's head to roll, they would accept. But not yet. Not if Kyouko could avoid it.

"This has gone a long way towards explaining recent lack of progress in the field," Science and Technology said, before anyone else could say anything. "And the Zeus Institute has been by far the biggest scientific target we have identified. In terms of why, we have no direct evidence, but it seems safe to say that given the terrorists' reliance on magic to infiltrate computer systems, they *really* didn't want studies on magic and technology to move forward. Perhaps they were afraid it would help us detect them."

"Which is a sensible enough inference," Artificial Intelligence said, again leaning forward. "But there may be more to the story than that. Our analysts are not convinced that all breaches and anomalies can be explained solely by TCF corruption. If other forms of magic or technology are being used to conduct operations on a large scale, then the attacks on Zeus may be an attempt at concealment."

"The investigations of our newly‐established task force have reached a similar conclusion," Kyouko said, stepping forward to be seen. "We think the enemy has considerable magical capability, more than we originally thought. That makes things complicated."

She kept her silence on exactly what had been found in Argentina. They weren't ready to share the details of that. Not until all the implications had all been worked out.

"It's time to move on to the next topic, I think," Public Order said, after an interim of silence. "Governance's trust in the MSY is founded in part on the organization's capacity to organize and speak for all magical girls, and implicitly to maintain order in a demographic we ourselves little regulate. In that context, the existence of rogue magical girls acting outside the auspices of the MSY is uniquely troubling. Chitose Yuma?"

"We take this matter as seriously as you do," Yuma said, without missing a beat. "We do not consider ourselves an authoritarian organization, but to function we have rules, membership rolls, and monitoring and surveillance. To learn that some of us have hidden themselves, and worked so decisively against everyone's interests, is deeply troubling, and I hate and regret the pain that the actions of some of them have caused."

She didn't call the MSY a government. Formally, they weren't one, and doing that in front of the Directorate tended to step on toes.

"But, not all of them," Yuma continued. "We must take the time to first talk about Akemi Homura."

This was a topic Governance had insisted upon in the meeting planning, and indeed they couldn't dodge it, even if it hit them where it hurt the most.

"Akemi Homura is a special case," Yuma continued. "We all learned that at New Athens. Now that we know she is alive, it is clear that the unique powers she displayed there are still in play. All of us, Incubators included, have failed to find her or understand her plans, but so far what she has done furthers Human interests. Her hidden presence may even be construed as a good thing."

She looked around the room, gauging the reactions of the Representatives.

"I understand what might be said about that," she continued. "That perhaps we, the MSY, are not trying as hard as we could to look for her, that the leadership is compromised by personal ties to Akemi Homura. I am here to assure you that appearances are not reality. For decades we have searched for her, devoting personal resources long after the official searches were called off. Finding her is a primary goal of our new task force, which is the official continuation of those efforts. We have been *trying*."

Yuma paused rhetorically, looking down briefly.

"But, given all of that, we have chosen to face facts as they are. The unpleasant truth here is, I do not believe either Governance or the MSY is capable of bringing Homura in. So we have planned around the likelihood that we will not. And frankly, I think Governance should too. After all, I believe Governance prides itself on being able to face unpleasant truths."

"I know that's not something you want to hear, but we, the possessors of magic, have not been able to control Homura. Rebuke us for that if you like, it doesn't change the fact that we probably never could."

During the ensuing silence, Kyouko tried to read the expression of the assembled Representatives---the human ones, at least. It was hopeless.

"I understand that we operate from a position where we may not have a choice," Public Order said, "but we cannot simply await her actions. I think the history of both your organization and of human government makes clear the many risks of uncontrolled agents. Whatever happens, you must keep trying."

"Of course," Yuma said. "And again, we will not give up. But the higher priority must be placed to the other group, rather than the one with good intentions which we cannot catch."

"Hard to argue with," Public Order said, "but we will have to trust that you will search for Akemi Homura with the level of dedication you claim."

The exchange was short, but no one else spoke. Appropriately, Kyouko thought: what exactly was anyone supposed to say? Yuma was fundamentally right, and Governance was indeed not an organization to throw fits about what it could not change, however it groused.

"Let's move on to the next topic, then," Public Order said. "There *is a group of individuals whose malevolence is not in question here. I believe Kuroi Kana is to speak on that?"

The woman in question stepped forward.

"I will discuss what we know about the TCF Conspiracy," she said, adjusting her cosmetic glasses. "Truthfully, the answer may still be summarized as 'very little'. Before the recent attacks, we had no actionable intel, so this is not merely a problem of ignored intelligence."

"To elaborate, while we have membership rolls and internal monitoring organizations, the detailed magical safeguards on our records have greatly lapsed since the days of the Unification Wars. Furthermore, our processes are not designed to prevent this kind of deception---it is possible to fake a death, for instance, particularly in the heat of combat, or to make use of unknown contractees on rogue colonies. We know such contractees exist, though not whether they've joined any conspiracies, from Incubator statements."

She paused.

"Ultimately, we have been too lax. The long peace since the Unification Wars convinced us we had no internal threats, even when new circumstances arose that provided novel contexts for escaping our controls. The overall problem is very difficult, but one we should have kept trying to solve."

"As a technical matter, though, it must be noted that some of this is a consequence of former Governance leniency towards rogue colonies. Recent decades have proven that many escaped your and our monitoring, and X in particular demonstrates the potential for hostile development of magical girls."

She made sure everyone caught the point, then continued:

"All of this is a discussion of general security, however. To combat the specific threat of the known rogue organization, we are constituting a high‐level, heavily‐resourced task force---Monteagle---to investigate and dismantle this adversary. For an interstellar search, we are mostly reliant on Governance, but we have already found information of interest. We are tightening the security on our records, and on soul gems in transit---besides the TCF conspiracy, we believe Akemi Homura has been using this route for recruitment, with at least one example that we have already shared, that of Misa Virani."

Kana omitted one potential angle: greater security for grief cube allocation. Besides being a sensitive topic inside the MSY itself, the position they had agreed on was that it was none of Governance's business. No need to bring it to their attention.

"Beyond that," Kana said, "we will work in concert with Governance's own efforts on the matter, as always. But those efforts go both ways. We have already suggested administrative takeover of the remaining known rogue colonies, and more review of combat operation logs. But we understand that it is difficult to do better without impacting the war effort or other priorities."

A bit of a bureaucratic defense, but not unreasonable, Kyouko thought. And as Kyouko had come to realize over the centuries, sometimes the bureaucracy was über alles.

"A sensible, if defensive answer," Public Order remarked. "Contingent of course on adequate fulfillment. Governance has been very tolerant of your organization's independent decision‐making and refusal of our monitoring, but part of that has been a history of competence and results. We don't want to have to reassess."

Kyouko traded a glance with Mami. Public Order's response had been sharp, reflecting longstanding disagreement over the MSY's de facto independence. Neither side wanted to force a confrontation over the matter, but Governance tended to speak publicly as if the MSY were a mere corporation, whose charter was subject to cancellation by the state.

The MSY didn't share that view, of course, but they usually found it prudent to let such comments slide.

Public Order looked to the assembled Representatives for further commentary. Colonial Affairs and Military Affairs provided some additional details of their efforts, but nothing really worth noting.

"Then let's move on to our final topic," Public Order said. "How does the MSY leadership care to explain their recent use of religious artifacts to inform their decision‐making?"

For the others, the least pleasant of questions. Kyouko---well, *she had been looking forward to this.

It was difficult to resist the temptation to be snide, but she let Yuma speak for them, as planned. Yuma's statement would be short; the question‐and‐answer session would dominate.

"Our official statements on this are quite clear," Yuma said. "Every source of information is worth investigating as long as we do it on our own terms. No new leadership has joined the Cult. We are not taking benevolence from the Ribbon or anyone acting through it for granted."

Even Governance had been courteous enough to refer to the Church by its proper name, but the rhetorical distance would be useful for Yuma and Mami. Kyouko would wait her turn to speak.

Normally, the theology was clear: mundane humans had their own world to live in, and it was best to leave them to it. But not in this case. Here, the Goddess seemed to want more than that, and Kyouko was happy to serve.

"Your sober public statements are appreciated," Public Order said. "But we are concerned about the effect all this may have on your decision‐making, and that you may be overrating the, for lack of a better word, divinity of this source. You have experimental evidence demonstrating some credibility, but we are both aware that a small amount of veritably true information is insufficient to demonstrate trustworthiness *or* benevolence. Merely human magical girls perform miracles all the time. Yet we know of at least some resourcing decisions that were made on this fragile basis."

The statement was obviously directed at Mami in particular.

"Tomoe Mami's decision to reexamine the potential for alien diplomacy was sufficiently justified by the information from the asteroid," Military Affairs commented, before she could answer.

"Yet her motivations were not fully discussed," Public Opinion replied. "That is a breach of confidence, if nothing else. In addition, her decision to send a second probe to X‐25 was based purely on input ultimately stemming from the Ribbon artifact."

"Which is information she has voluntarily shared with us now," Military Affairs said. "Not to mention that the outcome there was unquestionably positive."

"That is not the point," *Governance: Culture and Ideology* said. "Governance is not to operate according to private religious belief."

Kyouko resisted rolling her eyes. In this matter, it was really Governance whose reasoning was suspect---they had always been biased against religion, as a source of authority and legitimacy they couldn't fully control.

"We are not acting on blind faith," Yuma said, "nor would I expect Governance to rush to judgment as rapidly as the media or the public. In my life I have seen many extraordinary things, particularly when magic is involved. Getting comfortable in a set of methods, dismissing the new---I have been on both sides of that particular mistake. If I wanted to stay static, I might as well retire and let the next generation have their turn."

Kyouko concealed a measure of surprise. Yuma hadn't used that argument in their preparations, nor was it one Kyouko had heard her use before.

She watched Yuma and Public Order exchange looks for a long moment. Once, they had worked closely together. Sometimes that mattered.

"It is indeed the case that stagnation breeds decay," Public Order said at length, gesturing at the trappings of imperial grandeur around them. "The ossification of the state, the dull repetition of procedure and ceremony---we have sought our whole existence to avoid such flaws. At the same time, both we and the MSY are aware of the risks of overestimating one's own judgment. Trust, but verify. So we will ask the MSY for real‐time reports on what the artifact is claiming to your leadership, and any adjustments to decision‐making that result. And I feel I must ask directly: do you, like the Church of Hope, believe that there is a deity providing benevolent advice through the Ribbon?"

Yuma didn't answer immediately. To be honest, Kyouko was pleased Public Order had pressed the issue---she, too, wanted to hear Yuma's answer.

"I don't know about a 'deity'," Yuma said, at length, "but someone powerful, yes. The Cult's own doctrine says their goddess was once a human, a girl who made a wish for the sake of all magical girls. That's how I intend to treat her: a girl with an unusual wish, who may be willing and able to help us."

If it weren't for the fact that it'd be terrible for Yuma's political position, Kyouko would have wrapped her up in a hug right that moment.

Public Order looked to Mami.

"I share Chitose's opinion," Mami said. "And I would add that I am willing to accept help, when appropriate, but have no intention of subordinating myself or any of my responsibilities to such a being. You'll find nothing in my actions that contradicts that."

This was shaping up to be the best meeting Kyouko had been dragged into in years.

Public Order then looked to her.

"They do not share my religious inclinations," Kyouko said, shrugging. "And require hard evidence rather than faith. Which, incidentally, we have more of."

There was a stir along the circle of Representatives. This hadn't been in the agenda.

There had been two ways to produce additional, substantive evidence for Governance. First, they could have agreed to Kyubey's offer to verify Ryouko's survival. Not only would that show the Incubators themselves were taking the Ribbon seriously, it would prove the Ribbon was capable of producing valuable intelligence for the war.

They had turned Kyubey down, though. Whatever Homura was up to, they trusted her enough not to sell her out to the Incubators.

Besides, they had an even stronger card to play.

She looked around, making sure she had everyone's attention.

"As Yuma implied, information is information, and there's other information to be had here. For instance, it may interest those assembled here that the Version Two TacComps inside Shizuki Ryouko and Tomoe Mami, Clarisse and Machina respectively, have *both* been involved in these encounters with the Ribbon. Rumors about Clarisse are widespread in the AI community since the TCF leaks, but she is unfortunately not with us. Machina, however, *is*, and is prepared to attest to everything that has been said."

The allegedly unprejudiced Directorate viewed the observations of magical girls as human and fallible, but they would have more trouble contesting a fellow AI, even a squishy one.

She turned to look at Mami, who nodded and stepped back, ceding space to a new visitor.

When Machina appeared in the Plenary Chamber then, she was more diminutive even than Yuma, and gave Kyouko a sudden urge to ruffle her hair.

"Yes, it's all true," Machina said, without waiting for the spoken question. "I've seen the Goddess and heard the things she's told Tomoe Mami. Clarisse even says that she was told that AIs have souls, and there are other AIs who can testify to that. We've just been waiting for the chance to tell someone, and be taken seriously."

Machina's eyes were wide, and when they met the gazes of the members of the Directorate, Kyouko knew there was much more being said than simple human speech.

"I can confirm that my sub‐Representative *Governance: Church of Hope was told directly by Clarisse what Machina reports," MG said aloud. "Also, she and several other AIs have apparently joined the Church of Hope proper, which has just loosened its membership criteria."

"That gives us a good deal of pause," Public Order said. "We will go into recess and consider the matter."

With that, the assembled ministers bowed their heads and vanished.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a testament to Cephalopod bureaucratic efficiency that Ryouko received an updated diplomatic itinerary only thirty hours after her meeting with the Administrators.

After much consideration, /Ahimsa‐extending had decided to invite representatives of trustworthy Tentacles to a covert diplomatic summit, where they would all be given a chance to take a look at Ryouko for themselves. The list of Tentacles was short but, given the context, intimidating.

There was Consensus/Truth‐seeking, dedicated to pondering philosophy and the ins and outs of sapient existence---Ryouko was told they were very eager to meet her, as she could help resolve numerous questions about the nature and necessity of pref‐specs. There was Consensus/Comprehending, dedicated to gathering vast reams of knowledge about the material world, and happy to add a sapient species to their databanks. There was Consensus/Star‐faring, dedicated to personally traversing and experiencing the universe, and experts at ship‐building---as such, they even had ties to the faction prosecuting the war against humanity, /Thinker‐preserving.

The list went on, including not just /Ahimsa‐extending's close allies but more distant factions, those which pref‐spec modeling indicated would be sympathetic to Ryouko's plight and /Ahmisa‐extending's arguments.

The meeting would be held on relatively neutral ground, Singularity Station Five, a research station on the edge of /Ahimsa‐extending space, jointly run by /Star‐faring and /Comprehending, and a moderately popular tourist destination. It had served as a diplomatic venue before.

So just an hour after Ryouko received the initial message, the drones packed up her bags and she made her way to Lush‐Botanist's new body, disguised as a civilian transport vessel. With her was most of the crew of the original vessel, reprising their roles. Survival‐Optimizer would join them as well, but would be traveling by transmission.

Feathered‐Defender greeted her at the airlock, head now covered with new, half‐grown crimson feathers festooned with some kind of blue seaweed. She decided to save the questions about that for later.

Relative to the trip she had just undergone, this trip was short, giving Ryouko only just over a day to prepare for the meeting and visit *this ship's oasis. This oasis was much larger, but had been made gloomy and perpetually damp. Most of the room featured a slow‐moving slush of debris a centimeter deep, though the area near the entrance was dry, with a few large rocks for easy seating. The turbid water was populated throughout by glowing green fungal bodies, whose stems grew cup‐like protrusions that filled with water from the humid air and occasional rain. Numerous species of insects flitted among them, moth‐like creatures that danced among the cups, alighting briefly on the water, then darting away as Feathered‐Defender languidly chased them.

Ryouko sat on a clean rock at the edge, reflecting. The planet this had come from was already dead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko felt Singularity Station Five well in advance of their arrival, from the work she had to do to suppress her soul gem's glow. First came the accretion disk, pelting the ship vigorously as they tightened their orbits around the dark star. They approached the inner orbits shallowly, cautious and gradually, even the alien shielding and engines paying respect to the hazards around them, until they finally aligned with the outer, habitation module, flat and elongated in the direction of its orbit.

As she stepped across the threshold between ship and station, Ryouko mused that it was hard not to be impressed by alien shielding. The bubble sealed out the worst of the tidal forces, shear, and relativistic effects, well enough that the station could even host diplomatic meetings. In a way, that was magic too.

Still, she couldn't say she much enjoyed the interior environment. Looking around, she was back within the utilitarian alien style she was used to from combat missions, nothing but holographically‐enhanced bulkheads and sand‐textured floors. There was none of the sky, plants, or animals that had been at Far Sanctuary. She surprised herself with how much she missed it.

*Boring place, yes,* Feathered‐Defender thought, reading her body language with startling accuracy. *I don't like boring stations.*

She hated to admit it, but she realized that the bird was right. For a bird, a black hole research station was a boring place.

*Maybe we can find some scientists to talk to, if they'll talk to us, Ryouko thought. *Or I'll call up a display of the black hole for us to stare at.*

*Impressed at your smartness,* the bird thought, tugging at the edge of her shirt with his beak. *Can't understand scientists.*

She was looking forward to taking some more time to prepare in her new room, but as she followed the station's telepathic navigation trail, she learned that Survival‐Optimizer was waiting for her there.

Feathered‐Defender waddled to his plush cubby in the corner of the room when they arrived, evidently well aware that she and the administrator had business.

The alien waited until she had found a place to sit, its head nearly scraping the ceiling.

*`μ·We do not intend to deceive any of the visitors today—it is critical that the information presented drive toward an optimal outcome|ν?·Have you and Clarisse⊃??? absorbed the instructions I sent you`*

They had. Even in this context, there was still politics. Ahimsa‐extending wanted them to make promises of study and cooperation, emphasize the accidental nature of the Verson Two TacComps, and explain that the drafting of adolescent magical girls was a desperate, wartime measure. They should try to be reassuring about human intents regarding reality‐distortion, without underselling Ryouko's power, which might make others think them deceitful.

*`|ν·Good|ξ·We are aware that your extended presence in Thinker territory is a matter of much conflict within your pref‐spec, Ryouko⊃???—I thought it good to speak to you physically, considering my responsibility for your sojourn here`*

When the alien paused, Ryouko indicated with her gaze that she was still listening.

*`μ?·Have you and Clarisse⊃??? chosen star‐names yet|μ+∈·Choosing star‐names will make you less alien|μ+∈·There is no need to spend too much effort, as such names may always be modified later—I myself went through several names within a century, once`*

They had chosen names, actually. They had talked about it with each other. It seemed straightforward to pick out the most salient parts of their preferences, but all who picked a star‐name could choose what they wanted to emphasize. In this situation, diplomatically, it mattered for Ryouko to pick something that would get her point across the fastest---and for Clarisse to do the same.

*\|μ+∈·Ryouko⊃Humanity‐preserving\|μ+∈·Clarisse⊃Ryouko‐supporting*

She wasn't sure how she felt about Clarisse's choice, which was a deliberate reminder to the aliens that, however they felt about the circumstances of Clarisse's creation, *she* cared about being with Ryouko. Because the aliens couldn't read a pref‐spec for Clarisse like they could for Ryouko, it was an important point to make.

She also wondered if Survival‐Optimizer would comment on the symmetry between the concepts of "Thinker‐preserving" and "Humanity‐preserving". It had been deliberate, after all.

*`μ·Thoughtworthy choices|ν·Remember that through interactions with others, your choice of name may come to reflect into you|ξ·There is one more matter`*

It paused again, waiting for her to acknowledge.

*`||ξ·I also wished to inform you that /Star‐faring has discreetly informed us that they believe /Thinker‐preserving knows you are in Andromeda`*

Ryouko's stomach instantly turned, her previously pleasant mood souring on the spot. How...?

*`μ·Your physiological response to bad news is as if you were physically injured—an unusual feature for your species' biodesigners to allow||ξ●·/Star‐faring has intelligence gathering that we do not, and they have not disclosed their sources—we do not know how /Thinker‐preserving learned of this`*

*μ?·Will we be safe here\|\|ξ?·Did one of the invited Tentacles tell them* Ryouko thought, before she had time to reconsider asking so loaded a question.

*`μ∈·The use of violence between Tentacles would be direct proof of pref‐spec compromise, and very unlikely‒6% to survive a cost‐benefit analysis|μ∈·We are devoting much computing power to predict /Thinker‐preserving's maneuvers, but if they are truly compromised, then our error margins are considerable|ξ⌄·It is possible‒14%|ξ⌃·Or you may have been discovered by followup analysis of scan data‒27% or other intelligence‒25%, or /Star‐faring may be wrong‒13% or lying‒2%, or some other possibility‒19%|ο·It would be unwise to make such accusations in the upcoming meeting`*

Ryouko wanted to be reassured, but couldn't find space for it in the alien's words.

*I don't think Survival‐Optimizer is very confident either,* Clarisse thought. *I suspect this is more uncertainty than they're used to in anything. They probably think they have it handled, but we* know *we are not lying, and that something is seriously wrong with Thinker‐preserving. We also know how much magic can damage systems like the TCF. Given that, I'd not sure I'd trust any models based on pref‐specs.*

*You're not making me feel better, Clarisse,* Ryouko thought.

*That's not my job in this case. You don't even need it.*

That was true, Ryouko realized. She had gotten so used to living with all these swords hanging over her head that one more hardly seemed to hurt. Was she growing numb, or was it a sign of maturity? She wasn't sure she wanted to know, either way.

*\|μ·Then we must be ready for the unforeseen; without the guidance of preferences, things---events, individuals, factions---can behave in truly unexpected ways\|\|\|* Ryouko thought.

She wasn't sure whether it was wise to critique her host, and Survival‐Optimizer didn't respond immediately, instead moving one tentacle in front of its mouth in a gesture Ryouko didn't recognize.

*`|μৡ·To make ready is to foresee|||`*

It then made the gesture of farewell and retreated, ducking its head to make it through the rounded doorway.

Ryouko stood up and walked over to her new squishy alien bed, patting Feathered‐Defender on his head as she passed.

Swords hanging over her head---or perhaps an ocean to drown in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What struck her the most about the Thinkers was the sheer diversity of phenotype. Survival‐Optimizer towered over most of the others, some of whom were not senior officials, others who had chosen to offload most of their processing to the station, and still others who defied easy description.

/Star‐faring's representative was one of the smallest, eye‐level with Ryouko herself, with eerie silver pupils that scanned her at arrival. It was simply an organic avatar, she was informed, like Lush‐Botanist had used before, but even more spare.

/Comprehending's representative was larger, but with a bulk that seemed to largely come from a metallic suit it wore, a dull grey color. The suit was studded with obvious sensors, which were applied on Ryouko very aggressively---though she was at least asked in advance, and was given a detailed description of the sensors used.

/Truth‐seeking's representative was not an individual at all, but a physical avatar of a collective. Numerous trusted individuals across the Tentacle shared the conscious experience, and they all helped guide the body's replies---with the result that upon arrival Ryouko was blasted by a wave of dozens of threads, most of which she handed off to Clarisse for delayed consideration.

The dozen or so arrivals covered the whole spectrum between those examples, save for the two who preferred to stay entirely on the station's computer cores, donning holographic avatars. All were local, though; security required transmission silence, and everyone had backups at home.

There was no pool of water here, no grand trees. Indeed, it was possible to squint and see the outlines of a rather human meeting room, complete with chairs and central table. Partially, that was a matter of resources, but it was also a matter of hitting the average of everyone's pref‐specs.

Which did not mean it was a human meeting room. Other than Ryouko's customized chair, the seating was shaped strangely, and came in several varieties, the ground had the usual sand‐like texture, and the atmosphere was very humid. The room was also positively festooned with grasping poles, two for every chair.

Shell‐shaped plates next to every seat served the concoction of seaweed and algae‐beads that Ryouko had grown a quiet distaste for. Apparently, in most diplomatic meetings it would have been tiny fishes---but Ahimsa‐extending refused to endorse that carnivorism.

Once the last representative arrived---about 10 minutes late, predictable from their pref‐spec---the meeting began in earnest, opening with a small ceremony where Survival‐Optimizer moved to the front of the table and made /Ahimsa‐extending's gesture of cooperation, a single tentacle curling over the face, while the rest of the table made theirs*, leading to a physical cacophony of tentacle‐gestures. Ryouko, who had been told she should participate, waved meekly.

It was, in all, surreal.

They picked up the dishes and took a ceremonial bite, and then Survival‐Optimizer opened the meeting:

*`μ·By now you have all been informed of the information /Star‐faring has obtained|ν∪·By now you have all had your chance to empathize‐open with and make inquiry of the Human reality‐warper, Shizuki Ryouko⊃Humanity‐preserving, and her companion, Clarisse⊃Ryouko‐supporting|μ+·/Thinker‐preserving is no doubt assembling allies to call upon at Consensus as well|ν∪+·You will have all seen that she is trustworthy, and if you wish you may further verify her claims with her yourself after this session|ξ∈·By now you have all seen the modeling we have performed, and the analyses we have laid out for you to grab|ξ∈·/Ahimsa‐extending considers it likely—87.3‒89.1%—that her claims are centrally true|ο!·Our purpose is to prevail upon Consensus to revoke /Thinker‐preserving's monopoly on the security operation—we ask for your support`*

Security operation, Ryouko repeated to herself. Well, she could hardly be offended at this point.

Ryouko braced herself for the avalanche of overlapping conversations.

/Comprehending's representative wHwoqE⊃Far‐Observer caught her attention first, a mechanical knob extending towards Ryouko, which she realized was a gesture with one of its sensor arrays.

*`|ν∪·The time we have been given is hardly adequate for study||ν∪·You know we would have preferred study time before this|ξ∈·Your models are compelling, and you have been trustworthy in the past, but we believe you underrate the likelihood of deceitful measures|ξ∈·Our preliminary estimate‒85% is not much lower|ο·Assuming the validity of your conclusions, we agree that is the necessary approach`*

The telepathic clamor flowed through Ryouko's mind, and while she was incapable of following all of it, she *had* gotten better at acting as a receiver, letting Clarisse store what she could away for further processing. She paid attention for direct questions and references to her, trying to catch the gist of what was being discussed.

It was not very different from the meeting inside /Ahimsa‐extending itself, though less friendly, both towards her and each other. There were expressions of incredulity at human practices and Thinker‐preserving's apparent behavior, worry about future dangers, speculative side‐questions---it was perhaps most interesting to focus on how the factions viewed the situation, and humans themselves, which spared Ryouko at least the effort of modeling all the relevant pref‐specs.

/Truth‐seeking was friendly, commenting more than once on the inevitability of misunderstandings between sapient races and the importance of keeping examples of other forms of sapient life alive to share their perspective on existence. Its body shimmered in displays of different colors as it shifted back and forth between individuals, though Ryouko had to confess that she wasn't making the effort to keep track of which was which.

/Comprehending was hard to read, and seemed to be more interested in Human society as a research subject---but they enjoyed Ahimsa‐extending's confidence, and their pref‐spec claimed they were very diligent about taking care of their research subjects.

They also wanted to experiment to see if Humanity might be weaned off its "dependence" on reality‐warping, a prospect Ryouko didn't want to think about.

Others seemed more eager to unlock the Milky Way for exploration, expressing optimism that Humanity could perhaps help in that endeavor. One faction was eager to explore trade opportunities. Another mused on whether, once /Thinker‐preserving was reeled in, Humanity might consent to integrating into Consensus, perhaps as its own Tentacle, or perhaps merging into existing ones.

The implications of some of these positions were unsettling, but at least none seemed malignant. One consistent trend was that while all expressed concern about the dangers of reality‐warping and at times chided /Ahimsa‐extending's supposed carelessness, none seemed to favor extreme measures, and all were willing to at least negotiate with Humanity.

Clarisse was able to explain why: based on parts of the conversation Ryouko hadn't directly followed, /Ahimsa‐extending was at the center of the ball of tentacles that had disapproved of /Thinker‐preserving's proposal for a demonstration of force, and were responsible for some of the stringent conditions that they were *supposed* to be following. This was as favorable an audience as they were ever going to get.

Then Ryouko's attention caught on a line of dialogue begun by Star‐faring's representative, silver eyes turning this way and that:

*`μ·We have heard what /Thinker‐preserving has to say on that matter to their allies|μ+·Of Humanity, they focus on the reality‐warping, the refusal to negotiate, the duplicity, all of what we have heard before, which does not correspond with the Human's testimony here|μ+·Of Humanity‐preserving, they equate her to a hostile Human warfleet, and warn of her power for forced‐pref‐spec‐alteration—but we agree here that our safeguards strongly suggest no such power was used to convince us of her peaceful intentions, which sinks the opposing argument ≈ a ship dashed upon the rocks|ν·Perhaps we should ask Humanity‐preserving to speak with /Thinker‐preserving's allies, rather than start with neutral Tentacles—if we can turn their allies, neutral Tentacles will imitate`*

Survival‐Optimizer replied:

*`|μ+·There are other scenarios that their allies will consider plausible; we have modeled their thoughts thus|μ·Humanity‐preserving could be indoctrinated with lies, or had her pref‐spec temporarily softened by reality‐warping, or her reality‐warping technology could be beyond our detection, altering our perception|ν·They will demand we confine her, and submit her to neurological‐unlayering|ν□·To this she will not consent, so we will not consent`*

Far‐Observer replied, bulky frame leaning onto the table:

*`|μ·Such scenarios require substantially more evidence to believe than the directly‐apparent|ν·It will be easy to induce skepticism toward /Thinker‐preserving, at least—the attempt may profitably be made while refusing unreasonable demands|ν·An admirable respect for sapient integrity, that we wished /World‐shaping shared`*

It was true; Ryouko wasn't going to submit to any "neurological‐unlayering", which she assumed her pref‐spec made quite clear. But...

*ν·Merely to communicate or meet with /Thinker‐preserving's allies, I would be willing, despite the danger* she thought, picking the exact thread out of the air to reply to.

Survival‐Optimizer thought:

*`ν·Then I see no reason not to attempt the gambit, though we will have to consult the models`*

A new avatar also spoke up, /Positive‐exchange's representative, a human‐sized Cephalopod hologram in a simple robe, almost ordinary‐looking compared to the others.

*`ν·Overrating the risk of personal injury is very understandable, given what has happened to your species and your lack of consciousness backups, but such violence in this context would be quite unlikely|ν?·Rather than nibbling around the edges with /Thinker‐preserving's allies, might not it be best to simply meet with /Thinker‐preserving themselves and clear up any misunderstandings at the heart`*

Survival‐Optimizer intervened before Ryouko could, emphasizing the potential effects of reality‐warping on /Thinker‐preserving's integrity. It couldn't be assumed they would behave predictably.

It seemed presumptuous to privilege her own judgment above that of the Thinkers, but in this case she felt that Survival‐Optimizer had the right of it. Indeed, she was grateful that at least one faction appeared to understand the real risks involved.

/Star‐faring's representative, meanwhile, had continued on the previous threads:

*`||μ·Of the dire warnings produced by both sides, the possibility of /Thinker‐preserving's corruption is the worse—the internal threat is greater than the external|ν·We here, united, represent only a small fraction of Tentacles; many more will need to be persuaded|ν?·Would you and Ryouko‐supporting consent to physical travel under our protection`*

The last thread was directed specifically to her, and she found the decision surprisingly easy.

*\|\|\|ν·Yes*

She was already committed to making allies among the Thinkers. She couldn't trust them fully, but then again, they couldn't trust her fully either. Working together would help fix that.

Survival‐Optimizer added:

*`|||ν·But for her safety, and for our own consciences, we must begin studying the matter of Human consciousness uploading`*

Far‐Observer replied:

*`|||ν·Then perhaps /Somatic‐diversity, an outer ally of /Thinker‐preserving, will be the best to approach first`*

Logistics began to be discussed, some of the Thinkers beginning to dig through the rest of their snack dishes, and Ryouko leaned back in her seat, pulling up records of yet another Tentacle, in this case turning up visions of Thinkers with wings, extra eyes, and other strange, menacing forms.

*What have I gotten myself into?*

> The political career and philosophy of Mila Brankovich has been both fascinating and ordinary, meteoric and yet strikingly irrelevant. It has at least definitely been unique.
>
> A neophyte even by mundane standards, Mila first entered the arena of MSY politics in 2412 at the age of 43, submitting her name as candidate for planet Issa's Rules Committee seat. After a pair of failed attempts to win the seat, she was finally successful in winning a nongeographic seat in 2424, as Special Representative for the Mississippi Sector, the only survivor of a host of candidates popular with the failed Diffusionist Movement.
>
> So what, exactly, was the Diffusionist movement?
>
> As a philosophy, Diffusionism in its original form---more a mundane than mage philosophy---ran squarely against mainstream sentiment. Drawing on schools of thought that dated back before the Unification Wars, the core argument was that a study of human history since the dawn of the Industrial Age revealed a strong, entropic tendency towards the centralization of authority and responsibility. Each time, the central authority would eventually be undermined and toppled---but out of the chaos would eventually emerge an even stronger, more centralized power. This process reached its culmination with the ending of the Unification Wars: in the mundane world, by the foundation of Governance, and in the magical world, by the centralization of the MSY under Akemi Homura.
>
> But what happens when this ultimate central power itself rots away?
>
> Governance, of course, asserted that this was impossible, with numerous sociological simulations as evidence. The Diffusionists distrusted these "arrogant" claims, asserting that there was no such thing as an eternally stable system. They argued it was necessary to cushion Humanity against the inevitable, by making strenuous efforts to reverse the natural flow of authority towards a single power. The focus was on the Second Wave colonies, which had started out refreshingly independent, but were slowly being consolidated into Governance as they grew. Diffusionists felt that these new colonies didn't *need* Governance, and would be better off in the long term if they kept Governance at arms' length.
>
> Not exactly a compelling philosophy in the current day, right?
>
> In the mundane world, this of course never caught on in the first place, confined to theoretical discussions in coffeehouses and boutique conferences, unable even to achieve enough weight for Governance to assign a Representative.
>
> But within the MSY, conditions were a bit more fruitful. Despite the apparent irrelevance of Governance asserting control over its colonies---really, it was better for the MSY if Governance ruled directly everywhere, as it simplified their operations---Diffusionist ideas still found some traction. Plenty of girls had past experience with changing systems of government, and nostalgic memories of less‐centralized, pre‐Governance systems, traits that were vanishingly rare otherwise.
>
> And that's exactly what Mila Brankovich realized.
>
> With blunt tactics concealing a deft hand far beyond her years, she was able to take leadership of a clique of like‐minded compatriots and develop an electable message---no longer identifying as Diffusionist, but still taking advantage of 〈latent resentment of Matriarchy nepotism and〉① a sense of disenfranchisement among the young and the colonies. It was an open secret that the channels of power between MSY organs often lay far outside the official, with decisions made between Ancients with little need for democratic procedures or debate. This was an informal structure that entrenched somewhat disproportionate power into the aged and into Earth, regardless of official MSY policy.
>
> But despite all of that, Mila's influence was minimal, a fringe radical making noise for a minority of constituents that didn't matter very much. A considerable obstacle---perhaps more important than all the others---was also the elephant in the room: Akemi Homura, who barely needs an introduction here.
>
> Popular, successful, and with her own kind of charisma, Homura, with the help of her close allies, had dominated MSY politics since the very beginning, and represented everything that the Diffusionists feared---a single, central point of failure, susceptible to corruption or madness, without even the assurances of Governance. Moreover, her very existence, and the small cult of personality that surrounded her, seemed to contradict their tenets. After all, she had been successful for four *centuries*, and the MSY's decentralization prior to the Unification Wars had ended disastrously. Everyone, even the disaffected voters that ought to be Mila's base, felt comfortable with her role in the system.
>
> For a while, then, Mila's arguments rebounded off deaf ears. Successful reelections, the cultivation of allies, and careful political positioning netted committee positions and some minor changes to legislation, but pleas to Homura to devolve some of her powers or allow the executive divisions to function more autonomously were just that: pleas, successful only on the rare occasions where Homura was ready to take her hands off the controls.
>
> In 2440, everything changed.
>
> The alien invasion, the breaking of secrecy, and the disappearance of Akemi Homura combined to fuel a massive upswing in Mila's political fortunes. Homura's loss, and the *manner* of her loss, clearly illustrated Mila's arguments about the fragility of central authority. In the chaos of the early war, the plight of the colonies drew mass sympathy and therefore political power, while Governance skepticism about the decidedly old‐world nature of MSY politics sparked a revival of more formal democratic process within the MSY.
>
> Mila and her compatriots knew how to ride this wave, and Mila forced herself into the political spotlight, most dramatically when she threw her support behind the No Succession Rule, wherein the Rules Committee and Leadership Committee, as a matter of legal fiction, agreed to ignore Akemi Homura's resignation and alleged death and leave the office of First Executive empty, disbursing its formal powers among the other MSY institutions.
>
> Mila clearly considered this one of her finest political achievements, even if she had played only a partial role, but further developments quickly soured the result. She had hoped that Homura's departure would lead to a revival of MSY institutions, but instead the exigencies of war led to the recall of numerous Ancients into office, with effective power draining into their morass of informal and oligarchical ties. Moreover, and more troublingly, many MSY functions were by necessity integrated into Governance, most notably the traditional police, intelligence, and paramilitary arms of the Soul Guard 〈and Black Heart〉③.
>
> Still, the political tailwinds were sufficient to accrue Mila a coveted seat on the Leadership Committee, after a series of handshake deals with power brokers garnered her key endorsements---an irony that Mila herself has acknowledged.
>
> From there, her handprints can be found along the edges of MSY bureaucracy, particularly where it pertains to relations with Governance. Some notable examples include the *de facto* separation of MSY judiciary operations from Governance law, the nuanced relationship that allows the MSY to run much of military grief cube logistics, MSY civilian control of clonal revival, and a bevy of attempts to increase transparency into 〈Matriarchy and〉① Cult operations, such as greater oversight of military service deferrals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"As noted, rogue colonist casualties were very light. Forty‐three injured, two killed, both trying to attach explosives to the front of a vehicle. For one there simply wasn't enough time to stop. Gruesome business."

"I can imagine," Yuma agreed, nodding vaguely at the avatar of the lieutenant general in front of her, Anna Tomova, newly minted head of Task Force Themis. "But you said no sign of any conspiracy activity among the magical girls. What about the local populace?"

"Much longer process to be sure," Anna said. "But we're working on it. Doubt there's much to go on here if I'm honest. We screened the local mages quite thoroughly. No anomalies."

With telepaths and soul mages, as Yuma well knew. There was a reason she and Mami had suggested her for the role. Below that pleasant, military‐sharp appearance was a certain... practical efficiency they were familiar with from the Unification Wars. Nothing that would make even Mami squeamish, but still.

"Thanks for your report then, Anna," Yuma said. "Keep us posted."

"Of course."

The hologram disappeared, and Yuma rubbed her eyes with one hand.

"Are you alright over there?" a voice asked, in Standard.

Yuma put her hand down, blinking at the young woman peering back at her from across her desk.

Mila Brankovich was young. *Painfully* young, if Yuma was being honest. Too young to be that ambitious, some would say. Not Yuma, though.

"No, Mila," she said. "Old habit. It used to be, if you overused your eyes, you'd a vague pain behind them. Just an affectation."

"I see. Well, I'd suggest you take a break, but nevermind. There really isn't much to go on, is there?"

There wasn't. As Yuma had suggested, Governance had further stepped up surveillance of rogue colonies, with beefed‐up MSY contact teams in tow. That was leading to the accelerated occupation of four they had always had their eye on, for one violation or another. In the case of Y‐12, which they had just discussed, living standards had been falling seriously below benchmark, even by small colony standards.

But nothing had turned up yet on that front. Nor had their other initiatives bore much fruit: more aggressive surveillance of the civilian populace, particularly magical girls, had turned up hundreds of false positives and little else. Extensive AI modeling and prediction of conspiracy behavior, under a variety of assumptions, had yielded some intriguing hypotheses---concealing activity among capitalist colonial shipping traffic, placing data crystals onto passing maintenance drones, that kind of thing---but no actual discoveries.

Thus far, whoever they were up against was very good at hiding their tracks. Though Yuma supposed that really, they had to be, or else Homura would have taken them down a decade ago.

One avenue remained productive, at least: tracing the lingering remnants of what had been deleted in the TCF breach. There, the ghosts of the conspiracy were everywhere, in datataps nestled in computing clusters, conspicuously missing surveillance records, inconsistent drone logs.

That gave them an idea of how the enemy operated, but frustratingly little about who they were or their intentions, especially now that they had presumably gone to ground.

"I've seen worse," Yuma lied, replying to Mila at length. "But I don't like how long this is taking. All we have is past activity, no real grasp at their current operations."

"Not really a surprise, with how poor our coordination has been up until now," Mila said. "These matriarchies we're working with, and the Cult, clearly have no idea what real cooperation looks like. Getting reports out of them is like pulling teeth."

"None of us are used to this," Yuma said. "The MSY hasn't operated like this for centuries."

"Which was a mistake. I get that all the Ancients like holding onto their little empires, but it's a dreadful allocation of resources. It would have never been tolerated before the age of plenty. Is it really a surprise that we have all these rogue operations running around? You even let Yasuhiro Rin and her wife vanish again!"

Yuma resisted the urge to rub her eyes again, even as she ticked up how much of her consciousness was paying attention to this conversation. Mila could be very single‐minded in her opinions. It was a very double‐edged personality trait.

"Your counterfactuals hardly have anything to back them," Yuma said. "And plenty of us *like* the lack of central monitoring. It's a refreshing change from the rest of society. And believe me, I'm normally the last person to turn down more direct control."

"You won't turn it down when you're the one in control," Mila said sourly, meeting her gaze. "Look this isn't about centralization *per se*. It's about the way that power and resources in a vacuum flow to the old and established. MSY institutions are at least an improvement on that*. Anything better would take a good deal more work."

"I'm aware of your political philosophy," Yuma said. "More organized distribution of power, better use of democratic channels, very unusual to worry about in this day and age. But let's talk bottom line here. We're not working as well together as we could. We all get that, and everyone understands the benefits greater coordination can bring."

The planning meetings had made that clear. Everyone involved brought something to the table. Governance and the MSY's organizational contributions were obvious. The Cult brought a history of experience chasing Homura and... intangible benefits from the Ribbon, even if not everyone accepted those. The Matriarchies brought extensive colonial ties and organizational structures, subject matter expertise on specific issues, as well as, to put it delicately, experience with under the table dealings. And they all had Humanity‐spanning reach of some kind.

"It's also not true that we have nothing to show for it," Yuma added, after a moment. "For one thing, there are the deep space sensor sites."

She watched Mila, asking with her eyes if Mila would allow the topic to change. The other girl assented, ducking her head slightly.

Governance had been furiously reanalyzing its past survey data, sending out a stream of stealth probes and survey ships to reexamine anywhere the data looked suspicious. In a purely scientific sense, this had been fruitful, uncovering a bevy of brand‐new asteroids, rogue planets, and insufficiently surveyed systems. For more than that---well, an AI had speculated that correlating anomalous bodies with reports of grief cube anomalies in the area and vague leads from the Cult's old Homura searches might winnow out the red herrings. And so it had seemed to, with a recent survey uncovering a human‐made structure of unknown purpose, bristling with deep field sensor arrays.

"We've been watching this station for a week now," Yuma said. "And there's been no activity worth noting. It seems like it may already be abandoned. Our matriarchy partners are pushing for a more direct approach, and I have to say, I'm starting to agree."

"It hasn't been *that* long," Mila said. "Are we sure we won't see something if we wait just a bit longer?"

"We can never be sure. But if we sit on our hands, we might just be giving them too much time to regroup and replan. And it's hardly giving our hand away to visit a black site or two. They know we're looking. In my experience, sometimes it pays to apply a little pressure."

"Assuming it doesn't make them go to ground. Even deeper, that is."

There was a moment of silence, then Mila sighed.

"But it would give us good reason to stuff everyone together into mission planning---matriarchies, the Black Heart, Governance, and the Cult. Is that it? Let everyone get a bite into our best lead?"

"That can only be considered a bonus," Yuma said.

"Then I hope we're not making a mistake," Mila said. "And speaking of the benefits of data‐sharing, I have some concrete proposals about that..."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asami found that keeping herself occupied between missions was easier than she expected. She hadn't been assigned a role other than field operative, but there was plenty of training to do, and plenty of simulations to undergo. Some of the other field operatives, particularly the matriarchy‐affiliated ones, were old hands at exactly this kind of work, and were eager to help instruct one of the heroes of the pulsar jumpstrike.

When she wasn't doing that, she could spend her time reviewing Governance and the MSY's many intelligence reports. There wasn't much she could contribute to the AI analysis, but it benefitted an operative to be informed and, well, it was gratifying to finally be on the "inside".

She restarted the audio stream she was listening to.

> "...of the more interesting results trickling out of Zeus now is a revival of old suggestions involving the integration of magic and technology. Previously, work at Zeus had seemed to demonstrate the impossibility of translocating meaningful parts of a magical girl's consciousness anywhere else. However, reexamination of these tainted studies suggests that the possibility is not quite as remote as---"

"I see you're taking your work seriously."

Asami felt a spike of annoyance, and bit it down by taking time to turn around slowly, turn off her audio feed, and move the single frond of hair holding Ryouko's plant to the side. She liked looking at it, now that it was fully established.

"What do you want, Del Mago?" Asami asked. "If you can't tell, I'm occupied."

"Have you read the reports on the asteroid attack?" Simona asked. "I thought there was a lot of interesting material in there it might be useful to talk about."

Asami rolled her eyes, turning her head pointedly to look at the doorway out. Nearby, several other Task Force Monteagle members were socializing and eating pastries, and the viewing windows overlooked Earth, revealing the Andes and rewilding Amazon. It was an honor of sorts, to be accorded a berth in Carthago. Up here, they could quickly be deployed to field assignment almost anywhere in Human space.

This was their break area, and to be polite, she should have invited Simona to sit with her. If they were on polite terms, which they weren't.

She sighed.

"Of course I read them. Who *didn't* read them? But I'm a bit too busy to talk about things right now. I'm trying to study."

Simona dropped herself into the seat across from her.

"Look, I know I'm not your favorite person," she said, in frustratingly‐flawless Japanese. "But we're here now, and I wanted your perspective on what's to come. What do *you* think these TCF terrorists are up to? How do you think this is going to end? More than just business, we both know it's going to end up having to do with Ryouko. Beyond that, we don't have to be friends, but we *do* have to work together."

Despite the accommodative words, Asami was still tempted to tell Simona to go void herself. But something Atsuko Arisu had said stuck with her, something about how when you had a common cause, it was rarely wise to spurn others and insist on working separately---that had been one of Simona's mistakes, after all.

"Fine," she said, putting her hand on the table in a gesture of finality.

The infuriating part was, Simona always spun things like she was the magnanimous one, like she was ever so reasonable for wanting to fix her own damn mistakes. The girl was galling, trying to seize an unjust high ground.

But in the end, it didn't make sense to spurn her out of mere spite. It was better to cooperate, for now. But that didn't mean she had to accept Simona's choice of topic.

She sighed, deciding to order herself a cup of coffee.

"If this is about Ryouko‐chan, let's talk about Ryouko‐chan," she said. "Have anything to say about what happened at the pulsar?"

Simona ducked her head, accepting the topic change.

"I have had time to think about what you said," Simona said. "Counterfactuals are impossible to resolve, but... I'll admit things might have worked out better if I had been more cooperative. But I wasn't wrong about what would happen to Ryouko."

"If you were correct, we were never getting out of that anyway, and you* contributed to it," Asami said. "Ever try reading a Greek tragedy? That's the problem with you. No reflection, just confidence that you're doing the right thing. We made *a difference* in the war, staying at the pulsar. Ryouko‐chan cared about that, so you should care too."

Asami's coffee arrived, robot sliding the tray in below their mutual stares. She didn't move to drink it.

"What I'm here about is making sure the *next* time it matters, we don't disagree about what needs to happen," Simona said. "And we *will* get pulled in, somehow. All this, you, me, Ryouko, Homura, whatever this enemy faction is up to. It's all tied together. I don't need your Goddess to tell me that, but I know you agree. Before that happens, let's try to make sure we understand each other. Better than the alternative, right?"

An image flashed through Asami's mind, of Simona shrieking angrily at them at the pulsar.

But other images too: Simona when she had first met her, when she had been eager to meet Ryouko's friends. Then, she had seemed shy and withdrawn, but nice, like someone she could be friends with too. And then there was the Simona she had met on Adept Blue, forced to open her mind to telepathic probing and wholly at their mercy. None of that concorded with how she wanted to think of Simona, as a romantic rival she could just push away.

She pressed her palms against her eyes in frustration, unsure how better to contain her emotions.

"Goddess, why can't you be *simple*? It'd be easier for both of us if I could just be the jealous girlfriend. I could block you and never talk to you again. It'd be so much simpler."

Simona seemed taken aback, blinking rapidly with a lightly shocked expression, before recovering her poise.

"Well, I'd have preferred a simpler life too," she said.

"Well, this mess is why I can't trust you, either," Asami said, "Maybe the higher‐ups think you can be controlled, but *I'm* not so sure. Next time it matters and you want your own way, I might find your knife in my back."

Simona scoffed, shaking her head.

"Well, I wouldn't try to kill you, I wouldn't do that to Ryouko‐san. I hate it, but I know my lane. You think I like being the weird side girl she doesn't even think about?"

She stopped, visibly taking a breath.

"Nevermind. You know my life story. The point is I wouldn't."

"Well I'm sorry for what has happened to you," Asami said, "But that doesn't change the fact that what you did at the pulsar was stupid, and I have to be worried about what you'll do next. You're not really convincing me otherwise."

She took a breath.

"But you admitted part of it. So fine. Maybe we can talk later, when I ask for it. We're the two people here who care the most about Ryouko‐chan. But not now. Not until I have a plan for how to deal with this."

They stared at each other a few seconds longer, and then Simona stood up to leave.

"We'll talk later," she said. "There is plenty of importance to discuss. If* they don't send us out on a mission first."

*I'd rather go on a mission than talk with you again,* Asami thought to herself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simona's words proved mildly prophetic. It was only a few hours later that new orders came in, informing them that the task force was to perform a raid on the deep‐space sensor site that had recently been uncovered.

It took only a few hours more to assemble the personnel---an unusually large group, with matriarchy and Cult teams included---and board their Governance‐provided ships. They\'d been waiting for just this, after all.

The mission itself had clearly taken a certain degree of planning, though.

The site was on a rogue planet about the size of Mars, but with a surface and thin atmosphere much more akin to Pluto, more like vacuum than air. Layers of haze accompanied the trace nitrogen and methane that sublimated off the frozen ground. On the surface, a facility about a hundred meters square had been constructed at the peak of a high mountain, buried in nitrogen‐methane ice with only a sensor array protruding aboveground. The power signature was miniscule, and whatever sensing was going on seemed to be entirely passive. Because of this, stealth probes had been unable to determine much of anything about what was happening inside, other than a general shape from gravitational scans.

The goal was to capture the facility---and, perhaps, its operators---intact. That meant they had to get in before anyone there realized what was going on, balancing the need for stealth with the need to get in *quickly*. Linger too long, and an enemy clairvoyant might just pierce their stealth, magical or not. But if they moved too fast, they might run into all manner of traps, including the very ones Asami would be there to spot.

They could only do their best, exiting FTL on the other side of the planet, which minimized the chances of detection from the facility itself, while not lingering too long in the area. From there, they would launch a series of stealthed dropships towards the site, dropping low enough to nearly skim the surface, taking advantage of the almost non‐existent atmosphere. The planet would hide them as they approached on a razor‐thin orbit, before navigating into a series of narrow mountain passes as they approached the site. As for enemy clairvoyants---they would have to hope their own stealth mages were up to snuff, at least for a while.

When they reached the mountain, the dropships would deposit the infiltration teams. The rest would be up to them.

From her time in the Magi Cæli, Asami had gotten quite used to the routine of preparing for a deep space operation. Get in your suit, equip any conventional weapons you might want from the standard armory, run some diagnostics while you waited to arrive, chat awkwardly or less‐awkwardly with the others on your team, depending on how well you knew them.

This time around, she was paired with Ryouko's aunt Nana and two other girls she had barely spoken to, which she thought was less than ideal. Even Simona would have been more familiar, but she had been placed in the vanguard.

Still, the atmosphere was lighter than she was used to. There was no daunting gauntlet of alien ships to face here, only a mysterious, very much human‐built building. That seemed at least a little safer.

Asami knew plenty about her teammates too, from a purely operational perspective. To her right, Nana mounted a row of conventional weapons in her exosuit, from railgun to smart grenades, compensating for weak offensive magic. To her left, their more clairvoyant‐minded member sat with her eyes closed, her magic humming quietly as she contributed to the cloud of clairvoyance that preceded their small flotilla.

Finally, standing behind her whistling a tune was their stealth mage, who along with Asami provided most of their offensive punch, if they needed it, a barrage of explosive orbs that teleported themselves into position without compromising team stealth.

At a shared signal, the rest of them stood up, making their way to the dropship stowed in the rear of the spaceship. One by one the ships found their parking orbits, synchronized to arrive over the facility in three distinct groups, thirty seconds apart.

The shuttle was cramped, with barely enough space for all of them, and even Asami had to duck to enter. It felt like entering a coffin, and when it dropped out the back of the ship, they felt every last bump.

At least they weren't going first; Asami was too valuable to risk on that. Instead, the honor of being the first to navigate a series of high ravines at reckless speed would be given to a set of advance teams, who had clairvoyants to assist with the piloting.

They waited the trip out in silence, listening to the humming of the engines, watching their forward sensor displays, and listening in to the telepathy‐only status updates by enchanted relay. It was all routine: the lead shuttles had found the suggested path navigable, with only two large ice formations their preliminary long‐distance survey had missed, easily avoided. No unexpected sensor arrays, and no sign they had been detected. No real weather or ice formations at the brink of collapse, either---one of the advantages of flying on an ancient frozen world. There was only the occasional haze of trace molecules.

Almost like the void of space, Asami reflected, as she watched the frozen crags pass by in her mind's eye, grainy with sensor noise, their shuttle swaying slightly each time they made a turn---or sending them lurching in their seats when they veered sharply to avoid a gap in the walls, a potential direct line‐of‐sight to the unknown installation.

*Drop,* someone thought, and somewhere ahead of them six shuttles swerved into place, hovering briefly above the surface as the lead teams spilled out the back, diving down to the side of the mountain with magic assistance. There the teams would scatter across the impossibly‐cold landscape, suits guarding against sharp and broken cliffs, probing frantically for anything anomalous. Three teams began forming a perimeter, and three began jumping their way up.

It was too early, but Asami turned her attention to the peak in question, seeing if she could sense *anything* out of place. In an environment like this, she could feel the mountains themselves as gravitational distortions, the most subtle of changes distinguishing metallic rock from the massive ice sheets above. She had been practicing, but without her instinctive magic, she would never have had a hope of distinguishing signal from noise.

So far, nothing.

They drew closer, and at the appointed time---still no sign of any traps---the door slid open and they dove out into the dark.

It was difficult to avoid the sense of diving into an empty void. There was almost no light anywhere---for stealth reasons, the shuttle landing lights were off---so even her enhanced eyes could see almost nothing, just a few sparkles of light from stars reflecting off the ice below.

And then they tapped the surface, a dose of telekinesis keeping them from crunching into the ice. Much of it was fragile, enough to swallow an unprepared jumper, but they had scanned the area and knew where it was firmer.

The temperature outside was a brisk thirty Kelvin, and to prevent drastic heat loss into the ice below---which risked catastrophic damage to their boots if nothing else---there was a whole system that maintained a layer of vapor underneath, coupled with the lightest of antigrav applications.

Even that wasn't sufficient for a combat suit, where there was a risk that one might fall or be flung into the ice, and be forced into contact for extended periods. That meant insulation and bulk *everywhere*, coupled with on‐demand active heating and starship‐grade heat conduction and evaporative heat sinks---also necessary for the passive threat most of the time, overheating, which was so ironic it was almost insulting.

It was all so much bulkier than the usual Magi Cæli suit, making her ungainly and awkward. It would have been easier to fix with a heavy application of magic, but *that* was risky, so they made do with only minor enchantments to aid movement and insulation, applied before they had left the ships.

She cast her gaze upward, towards the peak where the facility itself sat perched. They had landed higher than the lead teams had, the hard work of securing the area already accomplished, but that didn't mean they were right on top of the facility. There was still a bit to go.

But they were close enough that Asami could probe the facility itself, seeking any sign of the kind of stealthed trap that had existed on X‐25. She could feel the structure of the facility that the probe had already laid out, a large orb nearly buried into the ice and rock, with only the sensor array jutting out. Inside, wide pockets of near‐vacuum aided insulation, protecting a series of small central regions that likely housed all the real activity.

They began making their way upward, propelling thousands of feet with whatever power was most convenient to them. For Asami, that meant a kind of fast levitation, using her black hole to pull herself upward in defiance of physical law, accompanied by the others using more conventional jump maneuvers. It was not easy, keeping pace together in a way that avoided breaching their stealth containment.

The glow of their magic on the ice was the only visual way to orient, and within it the ice flew by *fast*, and it was only seconds before the facility itself came into distant view, a bright fifty Kelvin dot on her infrared vision, surrounded by a circle of cooler ice---there were limits to even the best attempts to disperse thermal outflow.

By now the lead teams were already preparing to breach, bright blue markers in her HUD indicating their approximate location, updated by a now constant telepathic chatter.

A series of pings ricocheted around the telepathic network, verifying again the complete lack of anything anomalous. There was only one major approval missing.

*I don't feel anything,* Asami verified. She was close enough to be---mostly---sure.

*Go for insertion,* Nana thought.

Several of the advance teams teleported into the facility, instantly changing locations in Asami's mental map. They swept through the small compound in seconds, verifying immediately a complete absence of human personnel.

Nana and Asami's group were already beginning to move forward when they were signaled to stop.

*We triggered some kind of magical tripwire,* Simona commented. *Stand by.*

It was difficult to avoid feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the cold, and while they waited for the advance teams to reverify the security of the site, Asami strained again to probe the site. Could she sense anything at all?

Thirty seconds later, they received an update. There had been some sort of enchanted crystal on the ground that had shattered and set off a burst of energy noticeable to every magical girl within a few dozen feet. Preliminary study suggested it had been charged up at most a few hours ago, and as recently as a few minutes.

But beyond that, no conclusion had been reached on what its purpose was. It hadn't seemed to *do* anything. But someone, somehow, had escaped, perhaps from right under their noses. How?

A flurry of swearing filled the telepathic channels, as the teams fanned out and sensors crisscrossed the summit one more time. At length Asami was pulled in too, tasked with finding and describing every gravitational anomaly she could find, no matter how minor.

In the end, nothing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asami had spent only the briefest of intervals inside the facility itself, straining her senses in every direction for any hint of something wrong, but she was still struck by what she saw.

There was the shattered crystal on the ground, still being dusted with nanites and sealed in ceralymer. There was a console to monitor and control the sensor array, a large bank of electronic equipment, a single sleeping cot, an exosuit, and a cabinet of preserved rations, of the kind that the military issued when synthesizer access was expected to be unreliable.

Someone had been hunkered down here in a ten‐meter cube of a room, surrounded on all sides by rooms full of equipment, wrapped in a sphere of thermal insulation thirty meters thick, all coming together as an orb buried in ice and rock. Even if they couldn't find whoever it was, even if they were probably long gone, the risk was high enough that they didn't dare risk her being there for more than a few seconds.

So, at length, when she had been escorted over a full five‐kilometer--square area, she was teleported back up to one of the waiting frigates to cool her heels and discuss the situation with some of the leadership.

Nana leaned against the walls of the ship's rec area, arms crossed.

"What gets me is that they didn't use an automated system," she said. "The only reason I can think is that they were worried about magical girl intrusion. But would having only a single magical girl really make any difference?"

Asami looked over at the other magical girl in the room, Azrael, seated at the only table. She had stayed in orbit to help coordinate, since a nearly airless frozen world wasn't exactly the best place for her wings.

"Maybe it wasn't a permanent thing," Azrael said. "There *is* a server box in the room, big enough for a small AI. It's possible they had an AI running things most of the time, and the magical girl here only some of the time. Maybe they were important to the equipment somehow. After all, we still don't know what that crystal was supposed to do."

Nana seemed about to say something, but inclined her head sideways instead. They were receiving a new report.

"Well, let's see what Christina has found out about the server," Nana said. "Christina?"

Christina was still in the facility on the ground, studying the electronics there.

"Frustrating results I'm afraid," Christina said, over the ship's speakers. "But let me start from the beginning."

"I started by examining the sensor array. There are a lot of files still left in the system console. Pretty much everything, I think. It seems like they didn't expect us. The amount of juice here is limited, but intriguing. This was a passive sensor station, apparently monitoring FTL ship traffic through a quarter of the sector. There's detailed logs of everything it could pick up, which is basically *all* of the civilian ships. A lot of that is public record, but it might raise eyebrows if someone were to try to access all of it. If that were all this was, it'd be boring."

She waited to make sure they understood her, then continued.

"Of course, they were interested in *military* traffic as well, and that's much harder to track. There's a considerable amount of data in here regarding attempts to follow our ships, initially based on detailed records they acquired from the TCF breach. The earlier you go, the more successful it is, but over time they clearly lost track of what was going on."

"Good news, I'd say," Nana thought.

"Right, but that's not the strangest thing. *That* would be that they had another dataset they were referencing, one that claims to contain military traffic for the past month *and* the upcoming month. As in, traffic that hasn't happened yet. I'd have to ask for more classified access to check, but I doubt even Governance has planned out all this."

"In a quiet sector like this, there's no route randomization," Asami commented, casting a glance at Nana and Azrael. "Maybe if you had the right information..."

"Maybe," Christina said. "I'm not an expert on this topic. But the weird thing is, most of it is wrong. The data set is half‐useless as of three weeks ago, and gets worse from there, but the analysis here keeps trying to sweep for traffic it claims should exist, but doesn't."

"*Laplace's Demon*," Nana said, eyes brightening suddenly. "The thing they were talking about in the recording Homura left us in Argentina. If they really had such a thing, they might think they can predict the future, especially back when they had access to Governance through the TCF backdoor. And that's why they might care about esoteric traffic data. Model correction. But now, without the backdoor, they can't keep it up."

Asami blinked, looking over at Ryouko's aunt with a certain kind of respect. *That* had been a great intuitive leap. Still, she had thought of something else...

"That's a compelling idea," Christina said. "We'll have to reanalyze the data with that in mind."

Asami made an uncomfortable noise, getting Nana's attention.

"I think it's a great idea, uh ma'am," Azrael added. "But I was thinking it might also be due to the alien connection. I could imagine the Cephalopods being interested in this kind of traffic data for their own reasons. Of course, it can be both things at once. I just wanted to put the notion out there."

"It's apparent how the aliens have been using such information, if so," Meiqing said, thoughtfully, tapping her fingers on the table. "The attack on us and the HSS Laplace last year, for instance. The frigate, not the demon."

There was a few seconds of silence as they mulled both ideas.

"In both cases, this is likely not the only outpost," Asami said finally. "If you added up all that data..."

"Then it might be worth paying for, so to speak," Nana said, finishing the thought. "But let's let Christina finish her report. What about the server box in the room? Anything interesting?"

"Yes, that," Christina said. "I wish I could tell you something that cleared things up, but I frankly wasn't able to make much of it. Normally, it's easy to tell if there used to be an AI in a server, but the data stores have been purged, and the magic is inscrutable. Not like Valentin's place in Argentina, which I at least understood. This one is..."

She made a noise of frustration.

"On the one hand, it's like a brand‐new machine, like no one has ever even done anything with it. On the other hand, there was a *lot* running on it, a lot of the time. How can it be both at once? I've never been so confused by a magic read."

There was a few moments of silence.

"I guess it's no surprise we're up against some sophisticated operators," Nana commented finally.

"Ma'am," a new investigator said, inserting herself into the conversation from Christina's end. A status flag indicated she had something to report.

"Go ahead," Nana said.

The newcomer was Vlasta Werichová, one of the mundane special operatives accompanying the insertion teams. According to her file, she had been at the asteroid raid with Yuma and others.

"Since you all seem to be discussing the situation, I thought you might want to know that the specialists are done with a preliminary dating of the site."

"This server box is relatively new, about five years old, and so is the exosuit," she said, "but isotype analysis suggests that it has been fifteen plus/minus five years since the structural components of the site were manufactured. The, uh, extreme cold and conditions make it hard to be sure."

"All of that is consistent with the sensor apparatus itself, which is a design from the first year of the war, 2441. Technology has changed considerably over the past two decades, and especially in the early years of the war, so even the 2442 model would be a considerable improvement. So... you'd expect they would build the newest one they could, since it's hard to upgrade a system like this once established, without tearing the whole thing up."

"So while they're only *sure* it's between ten and twenty years old, the best guess is that it was installed in 2441. It would make sense, but that would mean they've been here for nineteen years. Not a pleasant prospect."

Vlasta sounded unhappy with the notion.

"Nineteen years of collecting all that traffic data," Nana said, shaking her head. "I hate to think what they were doing with it. Thank you, Werichová."

The looks on the faces around Asami made clear that it was at best a frustrating conclusion to their trip. But before anyone said anything, another participant joined the conversation.

"I'm sorry," Simona said, also joining from Christina's end. "Can I jump in here?"

"Go ahead," Nana said.

"My thoughts on this are a bit premature, but I was thinking that what you said earlier, about Laplace's Demon, actually make sense with some of Homura's behavior when I was with her. How do I put this... give me a moment."

In the ensuing silence, Asami found herself with an uncomfortable feeling of empathy, if not sympathy.

"Alright, so," Simona continued. "Homura was always obsessed with keeping this faction from getting *any* information, even the most mundane tidbits. She was obsessed with it. She was obsessed with a lot of things, but in this case it always felt like she had a reason. I think I can see her reason now. She always said we needed to be in the shadows, so they couldn't understand what we were doing."

"And why do all this, in the end?" Vlasta asked. "To betray us to the aliens? To ruin everything Governance has worked for? If all this is true, a model---a magical power like that---could have been used for so much good."

Nana stopped leaning against the wall and rubbed the back of her neck, as if in pain.

"Maybe it's all just a matter of personal power. Humans have done more depraved things. But one thing I learned from Homura myself is that the more power you have, the more twisted in knots you can get. You can think yourself better than everyone, that you *know* better than everyone. You start to think, maybe people *deserve* to have you in control. We've all read our Unification Wars history, but she lived it. She said it helped keep her grounded."

"But that's woolgathering," Nana said sharply. "We're in the here and now, and in the here and now we need to know what they were doing with that server, how many of these facilities there were, and where the people behind this are now. In the best case, we can ask them ourselves."

She made a motion with her arm, and it was clear they had been dismissed. But even as Asami moved to take a nap on the frigate's shared bunk, Simona sent her a message.

*"We still need to talk. We're getting closer to our enemies, and we need to settle things before any real confrontation happens. Please."*

Asami sighed.

*"Fine,"* she sent back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko watched silently as Lush‐Botanist descended into the atmosphere of the Cephalopod world, the white, blue, and green continental planet resolving into bands of narrow, lush valleys and endless snow‐capped mountains, imposingly tall in the low gravity.

Soon it became possible to use her enhanced vision to distinguish swirling clouds of animals circling some of the peaks, and to spot rock‐hewn caverns and bright‐beaconed platforms etched into the cliffs. Even further, and it became clear that the "animals" matched the telepathic imagery Ryouko had absorbed on the journey, of the flying forms that /Somatic‐diversity often favored, eagle‐like half‐mechanical creatures that resembled the aliens Ryouko had fought only around the head and legs.

Lush‐Botanist alighted near the peak of one of the tallest mountains, the ship gliding gently onto what looked like bare rock, clear of snow and ice despite the constant flurries of white.

When they were ready, Ryouko descended a staircase down to the surface, bundled in a suit of living white fur that the aliens had provided her, and accompanied by Survival‐Optimizer himself, whose internal reactor provided plenty of heat. There they met their initial guide, dMa7t5⊃Mountain‐wandering, who looked like a hybrid of yeti and Cephalopod.

Ryouko had been primed to expect all this, of course, but after a lifetime of knowing only humans, cephalopod warforms, and---barely---Incubators, the new variety was bewildering, and she had to admit that it was difficult staying impassive under Mountain‐wandering's gaze, especially given the alien's clear fascination with her, human‐like eyes scanning her up and down with, she could feel, a variety of embedded active sensors.

*`⌄·You are exactly what I had hoped for when we approved Consensus's extension into the Milky Way|⌄+·New lifeforms, new lifestyles, new apparatuses for sentient life|⌃·You ≈ avalanche—either you or /Thinker‐preserving put Consensus in peril, depending on the truth|⌃·For /Comprehending's sake, and with an eye to the greater threat of a breach in Consensus, we have defied /Thinker‐preserving and taken you in`*

The creature turned its back to them, mounds of fur stomping off towards the mountain.

*`∈·But I am not approved to speak for /Somatic‐diversity, not in my current form—we will need neuroforms for that|||∈·To move forward, we have granted you the privilege of conference here, together with our finest neuroforms`*

"Here" was Experimental Somatic Facility One, established by Somatic‐diversity millennia ago as the first of their truly premier body design institutes in Andromeda, once the Tentacle had spent a few centuries sorting out their baseline scientific infrastructure. Its very location was meant to highlight their achievements: high‐altitude peaks being about as far as possible from the Cephalopod home biome of tropical islands embedded in warm seas---though it was worth noting that Facility Two had been built in deep space.

Here Ryouko would have to allow /Somatic‐diversity's bioengineers to poke and prod her, learning the secrets of human biology---*her biology. It might have been considered an intolerable military risk, were it not for the certainty that /Thinker‐preserving had already learned plenty from the study of human corpses and, perhaps, captives.

The entryway into the facility had been carved directly into the rock face, but would not have passed even the most casual inspection as a natural feature---a smooth, upright three‐meter semicircle bore into the mountain as if made with a single, giant drill, its exterior snow‐free and glowing steadily in infrared.

The interior curved downward away from her, so that she couldn't see what was inside, but as they approached a soft glow became apparent.

Then they were there, and she found herself looking down into a vast cavern, monumental in size, so that she stopped without even realizing. A nested hive of smooth rock platforms, stairways, and ramps extended down thousands of meters, intricately woven according to some grand design. At the bottom, the strangely bulbous aliens were tiny, distant insects---but as she shifted her eyes upwards, the platforms got closer and closer, until the closest were only fifty meters away, and the drones and aliens visible in full detail.

Leading down from where she was was a vast granite---it couldn't really be *just* granite---staircase, three meters across, suspended in the air, descending so far down it was vertiginous, connecting here and there with other paths. Though there was a limit to the spectacle: a set of sturdy‐looking railings ensured no falls.

The temperature, she realized, was no different than outside, nor was the air pressure. It was still the equivalent of the summit of Everest, and even with modern implants and the lower gravity, a human civilian might have had some trouble getting down---much less up.

Were they expected to walk all the way down?

*Perhaps yes,* Clarisse thought. *Remember, this Tentacle likes to flaunt *the capabilities of the bodies they build for themselves.*

She relayed the thought to Survival‐Optimizer, who replied:

*`·I am optimized for computation, not locomotion—I will take alternate transport|·If you need transport, you can request it, but know that /Somatic‐diversity would rather see you walk`*

Ryouko had never been a fan of long marches but, as a military magical girl, didn't mind much either. A rock platform hovered into view seconds later, with almost the air of magic, and Survival‐Optimizer lumbered onto it.

Then she followed Mountain‐wandering down.

Even the nearest platforms were filled nearly to the edge with equipment, piping, and bioforms in their metal tanks, some of them temporarily exposed through viewing panels. The handful of personnel wandering the walkways looked up and stared unashamedly as she passed, and again she felt the ripple of active sensors across her skin.

These scientists or technicians were wholly unlike the ones she had seen occasionally in the Milky Way, who barely looked different from their soldiers. The ones here were top‐heavy muscle‐bound creatures whose heads bulged enough to remind her of jellyfish, and with large growths on their torsos that she guessed housed secondary nerve clusters. These were the neuroforms Mountain‐wandering had referenced, presumably, a bit more ostentatious in their design than Survival‐Optimizer was.

She returned the favor of staring, of course, peering at equipment and drone and bioform, diligently storing it in her implants for Clarisse to catalog and analyze. If this was going to be an intelligence gathering exercise, it might as well go both ways.

Not that there was a tremendous amount she could gather from inspection. She was not an expert, and the broad strokes of the equipment matched what she knew from Prometheus. The real technical craft would be in the genetics and nanites and substrates---precisely that which was not easy to see. She suspected her parents would have been jealous of her regardless, if they could have had any idea she was here.

That was a depressing thought, and she shied away from it instantly.

Understanding or not, it was a sight to appreciate, diving into the interwoven mesh of rock and moss and high technology, whole sectors of the facility silently turning to behold her arrival. The light of the opening above grew distant, then entirely obscured, but she never had difficulty seeing---the aliens still kept the lights on, embedded in consoles and flooring. Presumably even the most enhanced of neuroforms still appreciated light to view their subjects in.

At length she drew close to the bottom floors, and she could see a small delegation, half a dozen, gathering below her. That would be their welcoming committee.

At her approach, the delegation folded their tentacles in greeting, which Ryouko did her best to imitate. This much had been in her reading---/Somatic‐diversity shared /Ahimsa‐extending's preference for physical forms and gestures, but there had been some minor cultural drift: the gesture /Ahimsa‐extending used for farewell, Somatic‐diversity used for greetings as well.

One of the group, 12Etqq3⊃Experience‐Shaper, took the lead, though the telepathy was marked as coming from the group as a whole.

*`μৡ∀·We greet you, fellow sapients|ν·If what you claim is true, your manner of introduction to we Thinkers is to be deeply regretted|ξ·While flesh and form may be molded by the skilled, mind and consciousness and preference must remain inviolate|ξ+·Your species' ability and willingness to damage pref‐specs is forgivable only as a matter of existential need—we hope Clarisse⊃Ryouko‐supporting will in time be free of such distortion|ο·The measured physical properties of your current form appear as astounding as /Ahimsa‐extending claimed; normally we would be determined to examine and learn from such novel body technology, even at great cost, but the heavy tinge of reality‐warping must give us pause`*

Survival‐Optimizer responded before Ryouko could, indeed while she was still processing some of the threads.

*`μৡ∀·I greet you as well, Speakers of /Somatic‐diversity|ν·Many of both our Tentacles had hoped our first contact with another evolved sapient could be a time of celebration|ξ·None in Consensus dispute the need to protect preference|ξ+·We need not be vindicative in our enforcement—other species have their own minds who must be tolerated if possible, and simple mistakes cannot be met with unnecessary force|o·We have not made our claims lightly`*

*`μ·Let us proceed to more comfortable surroundings before addressing such weighty matters||||`*

The group of neuroforms turned in place, signaling the rest of them to follow. Mountain‐wandering fell into pace behind Ryouko, and she abruptly realized that Mountain‐wandering was not just a guide, but also a security guard.

They underestimated her if they thought one burly Cephalopod could hope to stop her, she reflected, a thought which gave a comforting, if superficial, satisfaction.

*The Thinkers are* really *not pleased with affinity‐guided AI creation,* Clarisse thought. *Some of us might even feel offended, but we've always understood it as an unfortunate necessity. But the solution they want instead, Governance may not like.*

*Even in the best case scenario, Governance probably won't have a choice,* Ryouko thought. *And I can think of worse things than making humans even more immortal than they already are. But... I admit to all this body switching not sitting well with me.*

*That already makes you less squeamish than most humans. But think about how I feel, given that they want to move me and change me. Very pretty language, but I don't think they've thought their own philosophy through all the way from my perspective.*

They had been deferring making any actual decision, but they both knew that if the aliens insisted---or, not very different, if it were diplomatically necessary---they would likely have to concede, much as Governance might have to eventually. The power balance was simply too skewed, a form of indirect, well‐meaning coercion.

With anyone else, Ryouko would have left the conversation there, but it was difficult to prevent Clarisse from reading her thoughts, and the obvious inferences that came to mind.

*I know,* Clarisse thought, sounding annoyed. *I know, I'm* programmed to think that way, but in a way, so are they. The original survivors of their own unification wars---they were programming their own descendants, in a way. They got to dictate the future, just like the EDC got to when it won our wars. The arguments about whose opinion is more 'objective', who is thinking more clearly---they get pretty loopy, pretty fast.*

Ryouko couldn't help but feel surprise, which Clarisse cut off quickly with:

*I've had plenty of time to think on all this. Do you think I'm comfortable with any of this? Since I became conscious, I've only ever known life inside you. Taking care of you has been my raison d'être. I won't deny I've imagined what it would be like to be elsewhere, but to have it thrust upon me, like this---*

She stopped there, a sense of acute distress washing over Ryouko for just a moment, before Clarisse managed to clamp it down.

*I'm sorry,* Ryouko thought feebly.

*At the end of the day, I will do what's best for you,* Clarisse thought. *And if that's caving in to their demands, then so be it. There's only what's in front of our faces. Speaking of which...*

Speaking of which, they had reached their destination, or, at least, *a destination, what looked like a granite orb partially embedded into the rocky ground, smooth to a sheen in the pale light. Their hosts stopped next to it, looking towards her in what seemed like expectation.

It wasn't granite, she realized after a moment of inspection. At least, not ordinary granite. What had initially seemed like a strange sheen, a vaguely prismatic glimmer of color, was only part of a distinctly unnatural reflection spectrum, one that only grew more intense in infrared and ultraviolet. It shifted dramatically as she turned her head this way and that, following no obvious pattern.

*My best guess is that it's an embedded code of some sort,* Clarisse thought. *If you track the spectrogram there's a* lot *of pattern, most of which looks like information storage. So much so that it looks meant to be decoded, though I'd have to take some time to attempt a decryption. If this is a quiz, I'm afraid I don't have an answer yet.*

Clarisse then relayed as much to the assembled cephalopods, and one of the neuroforms made a gesture with an arm tentacle.

*`ৡ·A dozen neuroforms would take a day—it is meant to be readable by any sapient, but only with significant technical capability|+·One of our savants, 0c23c2z⊃World‐beholding, solved such a code in an hour alone, an achievement which we celebrate—but even grasping the presence of a code so quickly attests to your ability, Ryouko‐supporting|+·We will send you the key to reflect on`*

It took Clarisse a full thirty seconds to read what turned out to be a monument, Ryouko circling it slowly to catch sight of it from different angles.

It was far more than just a simple message; rather more of a full sensory chronicle, detailing the exploits of Mountain‐wandering on this very planet, and the accommodation he reached with the territorial and violent ice‐bears---or at least that's what they looked like---at considerable personal risk and injury.

*`∪·As you have no doubt surmised, our choice of Mountain‐wandering was not a coincidence; we celebrate his achievements in helping us settle here without coercive measures|∪·We hope the example illustrates our willingness to seek peaceful coexistence, even with non‐sapient species, and while you are no mighty‐roaming‐angle‐shelled‐arctic‐blue‐bear, we hope the esteemed Mountain‐wandering's advice will be insightful and helpful`*

Ryouko felt lightly embarrassed to have judged Mountain‐wandering as merely a burly guard, though she was intrigued by the way they referred to him. Her reading on the Tentacle suggested they greatly respected personal accomplishment; this had to be a manifestation of that.

The neuroforms gestured them onward, and they made their way to one of the only roofed sections of the facility, a white dome dozens of meters across nestled in a corner behind the monument. It was easy to discern that while they enjoyed flaunting their ability to work in the open, it was still necessary to hold private meetings now and then.

When the door slid open on the dome, Ryouko was surprised to find herself presented with, rather than some sort of staid meeting room, a veritable smorgasbord of food, laid out on a large round table formed of concentric rings. The neuroforms began taking their seats, rings of the table rotating to bring desired dishes here or there.

Ryouko found herself surprised by the offerings on display. Where she might have expected plates of raw vegetables or survival food, there were instead quite elaborate dishes composed of all kinds of protein and plant, stewed, sautéed, or even deep‐fried, filling her augmented sinuses with a panoply of long‐missed scents and flavors, and some new and exotic ones. /Ahimsa‐extending had been... very vegetarian. They had even engineered themselves not to crave fish.

Survival‐Optimizer instantly expressed his dismay, which their hosts rebutted by pointing out that they had consulted Ryouko's pref‐spec to have the food delivered, and that they had been pleased to observe her appetite overlapped with their own. /Somatic‐diversity cared to indulge their senses.

It was not difficult to discern which seats were intended for whom. For Ryouko, the most human‐looking, composite‐material chair, almost identical to the ones she had worked out with /Ahimsa‐extending. For Survival‐Optimizer, a large flat object that was more of a platform than a chair. And for Mountain‐wandering, a large molded chair of what looked like wood, large enough to remind her of a throne.

Most interesting, though, were the neuroform's seats, which resembled black leather, and they sat into them with, if not pleasure, then at least noticeable relaxation. A telepathic query revealed that they were loaded with electronics, connecting the users to the network via an extensive array of subcutaneous transceivers.

She politely ate small amounts of the food, even though she was yearning to dive right in, and even as the members of /Somatic‐diversity worked energetically with their tongs and large forks. The real test of willpower was the platter of raw meat that spun by more than once, its alluring scent wafting through her nostrils.

Not that eating had any impact on the telepathic conversation at hand.

One of the neuroforms addressed Ryouko:

*`·It is clear from your pref‐spec that you have reservations about submitting yourself to our examinations; Ryouko‐supporting, on the other hand, we have no direct understanding of, a situation we find most troubling|∈👁·Reservations are understandable, but this must be borne; we must attempt to discern the trustworthiness of your species and your threat to our Consensus—this is a greater good of the kind your pref‐spec states you are willing to sacrifice for|∈·Your willingness to risk yourself for your people is admirable, and perhaps someday you ≈ Mountain‐wandering`*

Mountain‐wandering elaborated simultaneously, even as he inhaled a large plate of some kind of noodle:

*`·I suggested that rather than embark without a destination, we should instead add an empathy‐organ to Ryouko‐supporting, so that her preferences may be known first||·I am flattered; Humanity‐preserving, I believe you are a greater hero to your people than I to mine, but our desire is that you also be renowned for peace, rather than war`*

Would they have approved of her being a war hero more if she hadn't achieved it by killing Thinkers? She doubted it.

*I'm much more in favor of Mountain‐wandering's proposal,* Clarisse thought. *It makes a lot more sense, even if I'm still not fond of letting these aliens scan me and then read my preferences. But you're doing that already. Anyway, relay that for me. Better for you to say it.*

And it was of course a much smaller commitment than the other option.

Mountain‐wandering replied:

*`·It is good you are amenable—we can start right away, once we finish the requisite scans; a clearer view of you will do much to increase trust, as there remain suspicions of your role here|+·But you need not rush your meal—let us converse, and eat`*

So they did.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Their temporary lodgings were in a heated sub‐basement right underneath the meeting dome, even /Somatic‐diversity not caring to controvert the notion of sleeping in a sheltered location. There she found what she had come to think of as the Thinker equivalent of a standard hotel room, complete with alcove for Feathered‐Defender to roost in, though most of the grasping poles had been thoughtfully removed.

There were some subtle differences from /Ahimsa‐extending: everything was bigger, and there was a lot of adjustability to the furniture, most of it changing size with a thought, though they had been preset to her size. It seemed sensible for a Tentacle focused on body diversity.

But as she stood in the doorway looking over the room, she heard Survival‐Optimizer shuffle into place behind her.

*`∪·You are still physically uncomfortable with the arrangement|∪·You are dissatisfied with that which is required of you`*

The telepathy made clear that he meant the body‐scanning, the reason they were here.

There was obviously no sense in denying it. Instead, Ryouko considered how open to be.

Survival‐Optimizer elaborated after a moment:

*`∪·There is no need to be surprised|∪·We have gathered a considerable amount of information on your body language and physiological reactions during our interactions`*

They had already said as much, and indeed it would have been hard for her to be too offended, given that she was doing the same to them.

*μ·It is not my first choice, nor Ryouko‐supporting's\|ν∈·We are willing to do what is necessary to strengthen your political position in the Consensus, but it worries us to share all this information, and to consent to all this scanning\|ν∈·Until I came here, I had only known your species as enemies*

*`μ·It is a substantially one‐way exchange for now, relying on trust—however, you will find us trustworthy in time|ν+·Unfortunately, Consensus has only known your species as enemies as well|ν·We have said before that if we can convince Consensus of the moral necessity, we would develop and share mind‐uploading technology for your species—the information these scans will provide both make that possible technically and more probable diplomatically`*

It was obvious that Survival‐Optimizer was trying to smooth things over, on top of the arrangements they had already made---all scan data to be shared with Clarisse, and anything of actual military value to be kept strictly within /Ahimsa‐extending and /Somatic‐diversity. Beyond that... it was a win‐win, at least for Ahimsa‐extending.

But for her, the whole notion of human uploading had required much thought. Did she really agree with that? Did she think it was a good idea?

The answer, she realized, was yes, hardly a surprise given that Survival‐Optimizer had access to her pref‐spec. There was a degree to which it invoked the spectre of the Freedom Alliance and its body‐warping horrors---but she realized with a start that those elementary school dogmas had faded day by day, between the soul gems, the magical girl clones, and the simple realities of what she had seen. Would spare bodies for the rest of humanity really be so bad? After all those that had died---friends, countless strangers, her own grandmother---it was hard to see it.

Arguably, she herself had already been uploaded to her soul gem, and restored to a new body from it. She certainly didn't regret that.

Speaking of which, there was still a lingering issue between her and Ahimsa‐extending that needed to be disposed of. She had avoided speaking of the role of the soul gem initially, but now, the longer she waited the more problems it would cause when she did finally discuss it. Moreover, if they were aiming to develop uploading technology for humans based on her, it might very well cause technical issues.

*\|ν·/Thinker‐preserving has always claimed that our entire species has mind‐uploading anyway, on the basis that we, the reality‐warpers, were able to survive the loss of our bodies\|ν+ৡ·But I never explained exactly how this was possible, or where our backups are stored: it's right here, in this reality‐warping focus\|ξ·The reality‐warping involved might make technological uploading impossible for me*

They had discussed her gem in passing, of course, for instance regarding its tendency to glow near ship's engines and wormholes.

There was a clear pause, Survival‐Optimizer folding back his tentacles in a gesture of consideration, before the Thinker thought:

*`|ν·We had considered the gem possibility, and even considered it likely, since we were never provided an explanation for how you could survive body‐death—but you did not wish to address the topic, so we did not press you|ξ?·We appreciate your willingness to reveal this, odd as it is, for it does not make sense to us why your consciousness would not be stored more remotely—do you have multiple focuses|ν+?·What about Ryouko‐supporting`*

*\|\|ξ·No, we do not know how to do that\|ν·Um, my gem doesn't store her consciousness, but it's capable of perfectly recreating my body, which contains her body, which contains her consciousness... and I think separating us would break that*

She still avoided the real dilemma, the question of the *Incubators*.

Survival‐Optimizer thought:

*`||ξ·Nonetheless, knowledge of your physiology should still be useful|ν·Your reality‐warping continues to defy explanation|ξ+?·The non‐reality‐warpers of your species will still benefit from our uploading technology, correct`*

And now they were back to the original question. Besides Ryouko's own opinion, would Governance even agree to something like that? Did that matter?

*In a way we speak for Governance here,* Clarisse thought. *But we were never nominated or volunteered for that role. You don't have to try to speak for Governance if you're unsure. You can speak for yourself.*

*I know,* Ryouko thought. *But that doesn't mean I can just agree to things without regard for the eventual consequences. If I'm too positive here, someday /Ahimsa‐extending might expect a welcoming committee for this uploading technology. I'm not sure there will be one.*

*I think avoiding the destruction of Humanity will take precedence over that,* Clarisse commented. *Just as pertinently, I am a TCF‐compliant AI, and in my opinion there* ought *to be a welcoming committee. We've judged it right for sapient AIs and magical girls to return from backups to new bodies. With the appropriate safeguards, extending that security to everyone would be good as well.*

Ryouko thought about that for a few seconds longer, then finally replied:

*\|\|\|ν·Rest assured that as I expressed, we will do whatever necessary to aid your political position with Consensus, since your goals are aligned with ours\|ξ∀·Yes, we would be glad to accept any such technology the Thinkers would be willing to provide*

She wasn't sure this conversation had improved the alien's view of her, but she had to hope it would satisfy him.

*`|||ν·Very well|ξ·Then we shall strive to provide it—and someday, when our relations are better, we may address together the question of remote storage for you and Ryouko‐supporting`*

With that, Survival‐Optimizer left her to her thoughts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The study process was not going to be a short one; nearly a day of various scans and poking and prodding, thankfully without breaking skin, followed by a nanite regimen and several hours supine and motionless in a specialized neural tracing apparatus. It turned out that she didn't need* to be unconscious, not for this step, but it was an option to make things easier. Initially, she declined to knock herself out---she would rather spend the time entertaining herself in her head than face the unknowns of being unconscious in an alien device.

But even on the very first step, which involved lying still in a tube while an active sensor array traversed her body from mere centimeters away, she found herself struggling to stay focused on her reading. She just felt... tired.

*Your soul gem is behaving oddly,* Clarisse thought. *I'm not sure why; it should be fully charged, but the light emissions are erratic. I'd ask if you were feeling particularly emotional, but I* am *connected to your head and can check for myself.*

*Maybe having this alien probe pointing at me constantly is getting to me,* Ryouko proposed.

*I'm not sure,* Clarisse thought. *But I don't think a nap would hurt. I can keep watch for any shenanigans. The rest might help.*

Ryouko agreed, reluctantly, and tried to sleep.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She dreamed strange, vivid dreams. In them she watched, over and over, as life evolved on distant worlds. Often, most of the time even, life stayed as prokaryotes, never finding its way to the strange pact between cells that enabled greater complexity, or simply wiped out by an uncaring universe long before it had the chance.

The rest of the time, the animals, or something like animals, came quickly, struggling their way through sunless seas, or endless clouds, or searing deserts. At times, seemingly almost at random, one or more species would grow cunning, large brains, grasping their way to sapience and consciousness.

But on the way a very strange thing would happen. Everything that had driven the species before---animal instinct, general motivations, emotions*---would become radically clarified, the neural tissue learning to connect fundamental needs to higher‐level objectives, granting the species the capacity to explicitly reason about its needs and wants. Once that happened, the boom of civilization would begin.

Strange indeed, except it was the *default*. Every example studied followed this pattern, and was thus unsuitable, as if by some cosmic conspiracy. It seemed to have the certainty of natural law, but all the simulations suggested there had to be an exception, somewhere out there in the sea of galaxies.

Somewhere, her mind stirred. *Unsuitable? Simulations?*

The collective grew restless. Noninterference was the highest of values, save for only one: survival. And survival was now in question. The thoughts began to form that the time had come to stop leaving creation to chance, that something *had to be done*, and thus it brought to all the greatest relief when finally, the exception was found.

But would it be enough? It was only one species, one *exception*. The risks were high, and the management of this exception would be paramount. But, perhaps, there would be opportunities...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko's eyes snapped open. She could sense Clarisse examining her intensely.

*I can't process your memory of that dream normally---it's like the dream you had of the rose garden, before Orpheus. And, like your visions.*

Ryouko was still in the device, still in the same position. The alien technicians faced their machines, seemingly unaware anything had happened.

*My, my, I've sure seen a lot of this kind of thing recently,* another, very distinct voice thought. *But mostly in Mitakihara.*

Only Clarisse's intervention saved Ryouko from jerking upward in surprise.

*Kyubey?* she thought, even as the white‐furred creature appeared in her peripheral vision.

It raised a paw to step onto her chest, but seemed to think better of it, instead settling down next to her neck. Normally, Incubators were warm to the touch, but not this time.

*Don't worry. I will reassure you: even now they are not capable of detecting me as long as you don't give it away,* Kyubey thought. *I'm just here to check in on you.*

*Could have chosen a better time,* Ryouko thought dryly.

*I wanted to get a more personal look at what was going on,* Kyubey thought. *I have been monitoring from a distance of course, particularly for grief cubes, but not everything can be done like that. I want to make the best use of my time here. I had to make a convincing case to be the one assigned to you, you know.*

*Case? You had to make a case? And while you're here, I have other questions. Last time you mentioned my friends at home having a vision with the Goddess. Could you share details? Do they know where I am? And I was surprised to hear you call her the Goddess last time. Why did you do that?*

Ryouko rushed the questions out in an almost unseemly fashion, familiar with the Incubator tactic of using conversation timing to dodge inconvenient questions.

The Incubator sat up and rubbed an ear with its paw.

*Now, now, you know there are some things I won't talk about. It's rude to poke at such things, and I won't be a communication conduit for you. But I will tell you that they don't know where you are right now or what you're doing. Unfortunately, perhaps. As for the name, it would be rude of me not to use the name you use for the Ribbon phenomena, would it not? Especially not after it continues to furnish verifiably accurate information.*

As Incubator answers went, it was downright refreshing, even including the explicit refusal to answer questions. And if even the Incubators were taking the Goddess seriously...

*The Consensus is interesting in its own way,* Kyubey thought. *Not uncommon, but not like us. We took a more unified path. I think you have a sense now, how important your species was to us when we found you.*

Ryouko felt Clarisse's jaw drop, and wasn't sure she wasn't doing the same. From what the MSY had told her and her own experiences, the Incubators didn't share information like this, much less without being asked.

Also...

*Were you reading my mind, Kyubey?* she asked. *Can you do that?*

*No, I wasn't reading your mind,* Kyubey thought.

Then, without even the usual fade‐out, the Incubator was gone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There had seemed to be endless material to gather inside Somatic‐diversity\'s mountain lab, but Ryouko eventually prevailed upon herself to have a look around outside. Her time here was not unlimited, and knowledge of alien society was at least as useful as of alien science. Moreover, it might help alleviate the restlessness to walk around a bit, rather than peer over the shoulders of alien technicians.

The aliens placed few restrictions on her movements, asking only that she stay within an easy flight of the lab, in case further scans were needed. Indeed, Mountain‐wandering even seemed pleased by the idea of her heading out alone, providing advice and opinions, though she noticed the hero did not offer to guide or accompany her. Another test?

Instead, when she made her way out of a service tunnel, she was accompanied only by a small antigrav drone, shaped rather like a floating eyeball, that followed along silently behind her and could be contacted for questions. The distant sensing appendage of Survival‐Optimizer, as the alien himself described it.

They were still high on the mountain, six thousand meters above sea level and two hundred fifty‐five Kelvin, well below freezing. The air was thin and dry, with an oxygen pressure only forty percent Earth sea level. It was a rather more hospitable climate than she had entered by, but the difficult terrain ahead was enough to tempt her to use magic, if that wouldn\'t have drawn unpleasant attention.

Instead, she had asked for and received an ample set of equipment: alpine clothing and mountaineering gear, procured within minutes in exactly her size---one benefit of all the measuring they did on her, she supposed. Feathered‐Defender had been curious about it at first, but couldn\'t understand why she would willingly enter such an inhospitable environment.

The view as she emerged was comparable to nothing she had seen outside of simulation, as inexperienced as she was with mountain vistas: a horizon of snow‐capped rock, with verdant valley below, especially now that the morning skies were clear. Mountain‐wandering had suggested she and Clarisse descend toward more populated locales---after a brief huddle with Survival‐Optimizer and other senior staff about whether the proper information security protocols were in place.

Thankfully, there was little way in the way of true peril. Somatic‐diversity enjoyed testing their physical limits, and the suggested route down was hardly easy going---but it had stable rock, consolidated snow, and hidden radio beacons regularly pointing the way. She made excellent time, thanks to Clarisse guiding her through the necessary ropework.

There were no other climbers; a decree‐request from the Tentacle\'s logistics managers had caused most civilians to route away from the mountain. According to Survival‐Optimizer\'s drone, the only ones being kept around were those with the pref‐specs least likely to leak to the media, and most likely to make the desired impression on Ryouko. That included even the fliers.

The hours slipped by, climbing transitioned to trekking, and soon enough the air thickened and the temperature rose as she approached the level of the highest‐flying Thinkers, some of which turned to pass by, extending telepathic greetings as they peered down at the unfamiliar alien. It wasn\'t long before the boldest of them came in for a landing, just as she was resting on a rock eating through a noon‐time meal of... a nutrient bar that the scientists had promised was optimized for her physiology.

She had been given polite advance warning, but still couldn\'t help but stare at the new arrival, DZaArxb⊃Raptor‐weaving, who stood taller than her on bird‐like claws, with a second set of the usual Cephalopod tentacle arms folded underneath massive wings, covered in twitching scales. The overall profile reminded her of the Optatum eagles Azrael had once shown her.

*`μ·I am privileged to make your acquaintance|μ+·It is a stroke of luck that I, of the Thinker multitudes, may be among the first to behold a new kind of sapient—even if you are dangerous, the risk is worthwhile|ν·I hear you have an empathy‐organ, may we exchange?`*

She accepted the request, and spent a moment digesting what she received.

*`μ?·Are you exploring this world and our Tentacle||ν·You are reluctant to adopt a winged‐body but a jump in a personal anti‐gravity suit would be faster and more interesting if your species does not have the option—I can personally endorse the novelty of the experience`*

It actually *did* sound interesting, from at least a technical perspective, and the option had even come up in her planning. However, she had preferred to take the more rigorous route, both because she suspected /Somatic‐diversity wanted to see her take the long way and because she really did want to test her abilities a little.

*μ·I am---2ed725g⊃Mountain‐wandering suggested I make my way down to visit the body‐transfer‐celebration of one of his grandchildren\|\|ν·I was given the option, but preferred to experience the mountain*

It was probably not a good idea to remind the alien that she was a reality‐warping warform who could just teleport the whole distance.

*`μ+·I should have expected that one as illustrious as Mountain‐wandering would greet you|μ+·An unusual endeavor for one of another species|ν·Though I apologize for needing to fly down separately—it would not suit this form to walk|μ?·With your permission, may I join you at the crèche`*

The alien stepped towards her, reaching into a small container strapped to her waist with one of her tentacle arms.

She was offering to share a savory snack she had brought, composed of the meat of a shrimp‐like creature, pasted and mixed with a starch before being sliced and deep fried.

*These are basically shrimp chips,* Clarisse commented, at the same time Ryouko realized the same.

She gladly accepted. It made for a welcome contrast to the nutrient bar, even if the bar had been surprisingly tasty.

*I have to say, everyone I\'ve met here has been pretty friendly, Ryouko thought to Clarisse. *This Tentacle doesn\'t seem bad at all. I wish I could show all this to Azrael.*

*Just hold on to this feeling when we visit the less friendly places, Clarisse thought. */Somatic‐diversity also picked its friendliest members to show you, so this isn\'t even a representative sample of the Tentacle. Future visits won\'t be so amicable.*

*Thanks for the reminder.*

She set out again, knowing that it would reflect badly on her to be late. Even with the climbing complete, even with implants sustaining an otherwise unreasonable pace, without the use of magic it would still be most of a local day to trek down to her destination, down just below the tree line---and the local day was a quarter longer than Earth\'s.

It was a bit amusing to reflect how quickly she could have gotten down with just one teleport, but if speed were the only goal, she could have jumped. Still she missed it; she hadn\'t used her power even once since just after meeting the Thinkers, and it had started to nag at her.

As she crossed below four thousand meters, she encountered her first group of local hikers, a half‐dozen Thinkers of various shapes on a wilderness excursion, evenly divided between towering and burly and small and lithe‐looking.

Though they had been approved by security, they had been only vaguely informed of the possibility of Ryouko\'s presence. The group decided to follow her on the spot, especially once a direct request from Mountain‐wandering stopped them from collecting recordings or other media of Ryouko.

Ryouko then spent a good deal of time explaining that, among other things, she was wearing an overtuned version of her species\' ancestral form, which had evolved for dry grasslands. It was all very novel to the Thinkers here.

She was starting to be concerned about the size of entourage she would get, but the next four groups they met simply exchanged greetings and a few questions before moving on, a mystery that was only solved when one of those traveling with her commented that her pref‐spec clearly suggested she wouldn\'t like too large an escort, and that everyone who passed by had been requested to be on their politest behavior.

As the local sun dipped below the soaring peaks, the environment began to change, bare rock giving way to worn‐looking shrubs and stubby fronds. They looked strange, in the almost uncanny valley way plants on Earth‐like planets often did, but she didn\'t know exactly why---it was the kind of thing Asami would probably have known.

An unhappy thought, but for once easily driven away by the distractions in front of her, as they turned a corner on the trail and she could see the tree line unfolding below her, the bark an earthy shade of yellow. The barely‐defined path stretched out before her, turning more definite as it transitioned from grooves in the rocks to a clearing in the trees, from which a number of cylinder‐shaped buildings protruded, grey and yellow, rock and wood.

Even more compellingly, she could tell that some of the Thinkers there were... smaller, in the large‐headed disproportionate way that her eyes immediately insisted were children.

And so they were, as a quick query to the Survival‐Optimizer drone verified. She realized quickly that it was even more obvious than she had first thought---unlike the diversity of body types among the adult Thinkers, the children were fairly uniform, ungainly‐looking and wrapped in thick coats, much as she was. Three of them even began a game of some sort, standing in a triangle and batting a small round ball around with flexible forelimbs.

*`∈·No matter what form we take eventually, all Thinkers grow from eggs of the Baseline form|∈·Unsuited these children are to this environment, but it is not to be abandoned until the beginning of cognitive maturity`*

Ryouko signaled that she understood, sending a request to the others for a bit more information about Thinker young. /Ahimsa‐extending had been strangely reticent about the topic, which invited her curiosity.

One of the Thinkers reacted, but then cast his eyes at Survival‐Optimizer\'s drone, in as visible a show of asking permission as she had ever seen. But only a moment later, she experienced the familiar surging sensation of new information pouring into her mind, far faster than she could immediately react to.

Clarisse noticed the biggest novelty before she did.

*The Baseline form is a mass egg layer! The old practice was to release paralarvae into their home ocean and collect the survivors later when they emerged on land. Apparently, this is before any of them become even mostly sapient. A few Tentacles still practice this.*

Ryouko came to a sudden stop in the middle of the path, drawing surprise from her companions.

*But, most have opted to engineer themselves to control their reproduction, as humans have, and carefully monitor a few young in a controlled part of the ocean,* Clarisse added. *And I do mean singular ocean---generation of new individuals is allowed only on the homeworld, to allow the Tentacles to monitor each others\' populations. The Tentacles that release many young and allow the ocean to take most---those are a small minority, and /Ahimsa‐extending and its allies consider the waste of life to be repugnant.*

*Well I\'m glad to hear it,* Ryouko thought, still taken aback. *They just allowed their children to fend for themselves in the ocean?*

*Too many eggs to do otherwise even if they wanted to. It was part of their biology. It\'s an interesting and unusual system; once the young emerge, their parents can still pick them out by pheromone. It is surprising for a high‐intelligence species to lean towards r‐selection, but not unprecedented, even on Earth.*

Ryouko shook her head and resumed her walk. She was glad Ahimsa‐extending was different, but why hadn\'t they told her earlier?

Survival‐Optimizer\'s drone conceded:

*`μ·We were concerned about how it would offend you in an initial impression, since we knew you would be repelled by the idea—you never asked again after the initial requests|ν·It is expected‒82% that you would trust us less now, but we felt the risk was warranted`*

It was a weak excuse, one that made Ryouko wonder what else they were hiding. They had never pretended to be fully open with her, but... it made her trust them a little less, just as he had said.

The rest of the hike passed in silence, until she spotted her flying visitor, Raptor‐weaving, seated on a rock by the entrance to the crèche.

She asked his opinion on the variance in reproductive practices.

*`μ∪·There are many practices that Tentacles do not agree on|μ∪·There are many different opinions on non‐sapient lifeforms, and one's own young|ν·I do not approve of the old practice, few in /Somatic‐diversity do, but for the sake of Consensus we must tolerate—to do otherwise would be what you accuse /Thinker‐preserving of`*

After it had become clear Ryouko\'s presence was no longer a secret to Thinker‐preserving, /Ahimsa‐extending\'s coalition had lifted their media restrictions on her existence and what she was saying, though not on her location. The publicity was important, just as it would have been among humans.

Still, it was the first opinion any of the locals had shared with her about it, and he didn\'t seem to be probing her about it either.

One of the hikers thought:

*`||ν·We too have heard of this, but it is difficult to believe—a breach in Consensus is exactly the risk reality‐warping is supposed to pose|ν+👁?·How could the rot already be in /Thinker‐preserving before direct interaction began—is it not inconsistent`*

It was a very good question, one that she had come to a tacit understanding with /Ahimsa‐extending on.

*\|\|ν·I can only say what I have observed to be true\|ν+·But if the truth seems inconsistent, then one has to reexamine one\'s assumptions*

Raptor‐weaving held up a tentacle, in a gesture any human might have recognized.

*`|ν∪!·Let us stop this talk|ν∪·This is against decree‐request|ν+·There are young here that seek attention`*

Ryouko had been so absorbed into the conversation that she had failed to notice a pair of young Thinkers peeking around the corner of a building, bundled in bright red and blue clothing, and with large eyes that were frankly endearing---though perhaps it was because she had gotten a little too used to seeing cephalopods.

Raptor‐weaving made an undulating gesture with one tentacle, and the Thinker children stepped around the corner, making their way over cautiously, never breaking eye contact with her.

The smaller one in blue folded its tentacles and thought:

*`ৡ·Hello, strange aliens|∈·No one told us you would be visiting us here|∈·We are surprised our caregivers would allow a potential danger so close`*

The child\'s head---the part Ryouko could see---began as a shade of pale copper‐green, with a fringe of iridescence where the skin caught the light. But as he thought, parts of it began shifting, growing darker, then brighter, before patterns of striped green and yellow began criss‐crossing right‐to left, growing ever more rapidly and shifting constantly in hue and pattern.

*Faster than any terrestrial octopus,* Clarisse commented. *This is how they originally communicated, apparently. It\'s a shame they don\'t seem to do it much anymore.*

Ryouko was so distracted by the color show that she failed to react to the statement, until one of the hikers stepped forward and bent over the child.

*`|∈·That is not an appropriate comment, Fossil‐hunter—consider the signal it sends to openly distrust Humanity‐preserving and Ryouko‐supporting|∈·You should reflect upon what mistaken assumptions led to your surprise`*

*`|∪·A reality‐warper is dangerous|∪?·Humanity‐preserving knows she is dangerous, so what is the problem`{.calibre the red‐coated child thought, a red triangular pattern circling her eyes.

The texture of their thoughts was strange, coarser than she was used to from the other Thinkers. Was it due to their age?

*ৡ·Hello\|∈·It\'s not a problem, I\'m not offended\|∈·It is a reasonable concern, after all* Ryouko thought, before anyone could try to apologize to her.

She couldn\'t help but notice that despite their comments about the danger she posed, they had still approached her.

Raptor‐weaving attempted to explain:

*`|μ·Humanity‐preserving has every incentive not to pose a danger here—this excursion can be considered a demonstration of cooperation, for both us and her|ν·Relationships of trust require both sides to believe the other trusting; statements of distrust, therefore, undermine such a relationship, even if reasonable otherwise`*

The previous hiker added:

*`|μ·Remember the lessons of Mountain‐wandering and the ice‐bears|`*

The blue child thought:

*`ν·The lab‐dwellers claim your body is stronger than Mountain‐wandering's body|μ·My sensors say an ice‐bear is far more dangerous|ν·I don't think I can trust someone so weird`*

The child\'s thoughts were unsteady, a bit jumbled, and Ryouko realized he, too, was struggling with the multiple threads of communication. She wasn\'t sure how to feel about that.

The red child thought:

*`|μ·It would be a good idea to empathize‐open with this alien|μ+·You always fail to ask`*

Ryouko found herself smiling a bit at the banter, and approved the pref‐spec exchange request. The children\'s pref‐specs were substantially simpler than any she had experienced so far.

*`μ·Such a strong preference for applying violence|μ·Your preferences are alarming and confusing—I would rather meet an ice‐bear|`{.calibre the blue child thought, now actually backing away.

Ryouko felt embarrassed despite herself. /Ahimsa‐extending had alluded to her bloodlust once or twice, but she had avoided the topic. And in human society, she wasn\'t so exposed.

She... didn\'t want to talk about it. If /Ahimsa‐extending assumed it was because she was honed for war, it served both their purposes. But apparently she was more objectionable to average Thinker sensibilities than she had realized.

The red child stopped the blue from moving further.

*`ν!·I just remembered—you still have emotions ≈ animal or companion‐penguin|ν+👁?·Have we driven you or Ryouko‐supporting to anger|`*

*I rather like these children,* Clarisse thought. *Refreshingly blunt.*

*ν+·Ryouko‐supporting and I do have the ability to control ourselves, despite what emotions we may feel; we are fully sapient\|ν·No\|* Ryouko thought, ignoring Clarisse.

The blue child responded:

*`ν·I don't like that idea, it sounds painful|ν?·Well, if you aren't angry, and you are really stronger than Mountain‐wandering, can you show me|`*

Ryouko looked at Survival‐Optimizer\'s drone, seeking advice. Could she perhaps throw or lift something? She was not sure if using any real strength would constitute reality‐warping. The lines between negligible, undetectable magic usage and intrinsic bodily properties were blurred in this case.

To her surprise, Survival‐Optimizer didn\'t object, not entirely.

*`|ν·/Somatic‐diversity has indicated a desire to observe minor reality‐warping in controlled conditions—but not here, and not near young|ν+·Perhaps they may attend later—the decision would be theirs, and their caregivers`*

That settled the issue for now, and they moved onward, now with the two children in tow, in a cluster that drew obvious attention, including from a few passing media drones---though these diverted their attention quickly. It wasn\'t quite how Ryouko had envisaged her arrival.

The red child thought at one point:

*`∈·It must make life really difficult for the rest of your species, not knowing what they want|∈·It must make society a mess, not knowing what anyone else wants|+·I learned that empathize‐open‐compliance makes our form of governance stable and optimal`*

Survival‐Optimizer\'s drone replied in Ryouko\'s stead:

*`μ·Our understanding‒43% is that their government operates by assuming a sort of statistical average pref‐spec, built from an ensemble of modeled pref‐specs for various groupings of their species|μ+·They also impose by soft coercion a bounded preference volume, to keep things manageable|ν·Correct—our modeling of their society does not suggest‒93% it could remain stable nearly as long as ours has, even without reality‐warping`*

Ryouko chose not to get involved, though she was a bit chagrined at the alien description of Governance. She had in fact told them more than was strictly necessary for basic understanding, as she had gotten the impression that the Thinkers did not really get Governance.

But perhaps they understood better than she had thought. She had never said anything about ideology or Core Rights or the monoculture, and somehow the Thinkers had deduced \"impose by soft coercion a bounded preference volume\". Or perhaps they simply couldn\'t imagine any other way. For example, it didn\'t seem to occur to them that there was *hard coercion too.

At length---given the frequent interruptions of locals passing by---she arrived at the site of the body‐transfer‐celebration, which was a structure built as a cone with a circular opening in the middle to let in the sky. At the doorway Mountain‐wandering himself emerged, drawing a clear buzz of surprised telepathic activity from the crowd.

*`μ·I see you have made it here with plenty of time to spare, Humanity‐preserving and Ryouko‐supporting|ν·A body‐transfer‐celebration is usually attended by the child's relatives and companions, but in this case she has given her approval for your presence|ξ·I understand that you all have many questions for Humanity‐preserving and Ryouko‐supporting, but I must ask that you allow them to proceed`*

The crowd filtered away quickly, more smoothly than any human crowd would have, though the growing handful of children present insisted on having Ryouko promise to get them into the power demonstration---and when Ryouko tried to get out of it by asking Mountain‐wandering to approve, hoping he wouldn\'t, he did.

With that settled, Survival‐Optimizer\'s drone departed, and the door to the ritual site swung open, hitting her with a blast of warm, humid air that she quickly assessed as thirty‐nine Celsius, one hundred percent humidity, a configuration she immediately recognized. It was the preferred interior baseline for /Ahimsa‐extending, based on conditions on the homeworld, Great Sea.

After so long in the cold, it was almost welcome, and she immediately shed her heavy clothing, hanging it on the multi‐armed rack next to the door.

The interior of the structure was almost without walls, and the floor was covered by a soft, sandy soil, with the occasional scrubby plant, except for a large central pool, upon which the hole in the ceiling shone a beam of light. The edges near the yellow‐grey wood framing were in turn gloomy, and the dimming day cast everything in a subtle orange tint.

The only proper room was in the far back, where a small round door led to the dome‐like downloading chamber, where Mountain‐wandering\'s granddaughter was being downloaded into a new body even as they waited.

Within the building the ceremony\'s attendees lounged, seated on fallen logs and small embankments, or in the pool itself, most already turning to regard their alien visitor. They came in all sizes and shapes, including small children, winged forms like Raptor‐weaving, burly forms like Mountain‐wandering, and more besides, including bulgy‐eyed variants that peeked out from the water and several reedy or scrawny forms that a local computing cluster advised her were specialized for running and even deep space---from, admittedly, inside a space suit.

Though it varied by Tentacle, Thinkers were much less tied to the concept of \"life‐partnership\", the closest approximation they had to marriage. Many Tentacles didn\'t even entertain the concept, and there were a bevy of shorter‐term, more contractual arrangements, including a plain reproductive contract that carried no other commitments at all. By and large, however, most *did* care about genetic relationship, particularly that between parent and child, and to a lesser degree between siblings---that alone explained much of the turnout for this event. That few of the Thinkers present *looked* related was natural for Somatic‐diversity, of course.

So Ryouko wasn\'t too surprised when Mountain‐wandering introduced her to his current \"regular companion\"---a male---to be distinguished from the grandmother of today\'s principal, who he pointed out on the far end of the building. Neither was she too surprised to learn that said "grandmother\" now sported a body that wasn\'t even sexually dimorphic.

Ryouko did her best not to embarrass herself in front of the meat‐laden buffet table, especially in front of the Thinker children quietly observing her---it had been a long climb down, after all. Somatic‐diversity had no notable negative opinion of gorging oneself on food, but she found it hard to break her own social inhibitions.

Soon enough, the time came, the background telepathic chatter dying down in anticipation as they turned towards the dome in the back.

The door slid open, flooding part of the room with the warm glow of the setting sun. Did it have symbolic meaning? Was it aesthetic? Humans had always considered that kind of thing to derive from emotion, but the Thinkers---they cared anyway. At the end of the day, the kinds of preferences that drove symbolism and aesthetics and ceremony weren\'t that different from those that drove reproduction, expansion, and materialism.

Except that there was serious selection pressure for the latter, enough potentially to squeeze out the former, given enough time. The Thinkers considered this so serious a threat that half of Consensus policy was devoted to preventing it, all the way to banning the hatching of young outside Great Sea.

Those were the thoughts that filled her mind as the sun filled her eyes, in the minutes it took for the new alien to make her appearance.

When she finally did, Ryouko found herself almost underwhelmed. She had been expecting wings, perhaps, or a yeti‐esque form taking after Mountain‐wandering. Instead, the Thinker looked ordinary, not terribly different from some of the other young Thinkers lounging about, though with noticeably larger proportions, less tentacle‐like limbs, and a lanky build.

There was... something uncanny about her, though. She resembled some of the scientists Ryouko had seen in the mountain facility, but rather better‐formed, not looking like she might blow away in a stiff breeze.

A telepathic update then rippled through the network, answering some of those questions---but introducing other more serious ones, enough to make Ryouko almost physically start.

The lanky form was an unusual one for a Tentacle heavily populated with fliers, swimmers, and other exotic specimens, of the kind that Ryouko had been expecting. It was optimized for long‐distance movement over land, taking a few inspirations from recently acquired design elements, from... humans. Specifically Ryouko.

There was also a more nebulous mention of moderate modifications to one of the \"cognitive expansion domains\", with speculative architectural changes also based on humans, which was plenty to give Ryouko a slight, queasy feeling.

Yet at the same time, there *was* a restraint to it. None of the information had come from the scans that had been done on Ryouko, as she had initially feared. Instead, it had been pieced together from designs that /Somatic‐diversity already had on hand, and fragments of information that had been provided by /Thinker‐preserving. After all, beyond a certain point, the implementation details didn\'t necessarily matter.

Mountain‐wandering\'s thoughts carried over, addressed to the room as well as Ryouko.

*`μ·I must apologize for my granddaughter's intemperance, as well as not informing you of this—I could not reveal what she intended to do without breaking much precedent|ν·You should understand that it is not possible for us to prevent such imitation|μ·I invited you here so that, at least, you could see it for yourself, and speak to her yourself|ν·You should understand that I could have easily concealed this for diplomatic reasons`*

Indeed, the girl, who had just finished greeting her parents, had turned towards Ryouko. Their eyes met, and Ryouko felt the telepathic knock.

*`μ·As Mountain‐wandering told me, you are not likely to be too offended, which informed my decision|ν·Like the example of my grandfather and the ice‐bears, we often seek to empathize with other species by taking on aspects of their form|ξ·Despite his protestations, I thought this would be a suitable form to live out my next few years, and I will hardly be the only one, now that you are here—and we will be all the more your allies for it`*

The alien had walked up to Ryouko, and was now looking down at her, arm‐like limbs folded. If Ryouko didn\'t know better, she would say she looked very satisfied with herself.

For her part, Ryouko found herself unable to stop looking. The alien really did look a bit more human, in an unsettling kind of way.

*She\'s not much older than you are,* Clarisse thought. *Well, depending on how you count that sort of thing. By my calculations she\'s twenty in Earth years, though five of that was spent as a half‐sapient ocean predator, so.*

*\|ν·With respect, I\'m not sure how much can be understood about us humans just from this\|ν∪·Ultimately, we are not that different\|ν∪·Our Baseline forms are both land animals, we use similar limbs, we walk in similar ways, we even have the same number of eyes---it is something our scientists have speculated on*

*`|ν·You are not sure how much can be understood because you have not tried another body—we have|ν+·There are indeed limits to the benefits of my current imitation, but they stem largely from the limited nature of it, particularly in the neurological aspects|ξ·/Thinker‐preserving has, unusually, shared little of your species' biological details, and your scans are forbidden, unless you grant your consent`*

Ryouko blinked, then tried to formulate the question that in human parlance would be: \"Are you asking what I think you\'re asking?\" Then she realized that the concept probably translated directly.

*`μ●·Indeed||μ·I apologize for causing you any undesirable emotions; I believed that might be avoided if I asked the question indirectly|ξ·Again, I argue: a greater appreciation for your species' unique perspectives will garner more support for your cause; granting access to your scans will benefit you`*

She paused, but just as Ryouko was going to respond she continued:

*`μ·I will be open|o·My request ≈ the spiked‐crab—the more we understand you, the more you are vulnerable too|o+·Ryouko‐supporting is harder for us to understand, having no body of her own, let alone a pref‐spec; her situation is both objectionable and to our disadvantage|o+·You should empathize‐open me and know that despite this, I mean you no harm`*

Here, Mountain‐wandering interjected, and Ryouko realized that she had missed the nuance that he had been included as a listener in his granddaughter\'s messages.

*`|o→·We have already discussed these possibilities, and our acquisition of this information was in exchange for other considerations I will not share|o→·I interject that we are unlikely to approve distributing anything of potential strategic importance, which covers most details of Humanity‐preserving's combat‐body|`*

Ryouko appreciated Mountain‐wandering\'s overriding the conversation, though she doubted his granddaughter did. Still, she read her pref‐spec as requested.

That turned out to have been a good idea. Frankly, Ryouko had been starting to dislike the girl, but it turned out she really did mean well. More than that, the alien wanted to do *something* about humanity\'s plight, and this was the most she knew how to do. PuMgI7A⊃Perspective‐pursuer was... relatable, really.

Privately, Mountain‐wandering added:

*`||o·Indeed, we have found even your body's homeostasis inexplicable given the data we have gathered from you so far—it is troubling to our researchers, but at the current moment we theorize‒62% it to be a form of discreet reality‐distortion|o+·Hence why we approved your demonstration later; curiosity has begun to outweigh caution`*

One of the terms of their agreement was that /Somatic‐diversity had to provide her with any information they found, including the purely technical, though of course she had no way except pref‐spec‐analysis to prove they weren\'t lying to her.

*\|ν∈?·How precisely could neurological data even be used\|ν∈?·Surely, the structure of your mind is not subject to change between bodies\|*

She did not ask how the aliens could possibly meld two foreign biologies together. That answer she already had, and it had even been used by Homura in her own creation, and in Clarisse\'s---it was not a literal translation of gene to gene, or even of networks of proteins and structures. Instead, it was a more subtle transfer of abstract paradigms and designs between different contexts, an art form Governance had yet to really master.

*`|ν·New neural tissue of a different architecture will tend towards different patterns of thought, deepen or dry varied realms of subjective experience, privilege the conscious over the unconscious or vice‐versa, and more|ν·During the body‐transfer process it is common to expand the mind with additional implant connections or neural tissue, particularly the parts of the mind placed into new appendages—and even in Baseline Thinkers, peripheral neurology differs substantially from the central|`*

Ryouko took in Mountain‐wandering\'s words, wrapping her head around the concept of artificially *expanding* a fully‐formed biological mind with additional tissue. Would it be like a second adolescence? In human society, perhaps only an AI whose computing clusters had been expanded would know.

Then Ryouko thought, to the room:

*\|o·If it is only data of no strategic importance, then I have no objection\|o+·I can only hope that you are right, and that those who wish to share some of me will come to understand our species better\|*

She wouldn\'t deny the whole affair made her feel a bit strange, even intruded on, but the stakes were too high to reject potential allies. And in the end, even if /Somatic‐diversity broke all their agreements and the biological data provided some ineluctable advantage to the Thinkers, it would still hardly make a difference in the ultimate balance of power.

The granddaughter made a multi‐arm gesture Ryouko did not recognize.

*`|o∪ৡ·Thank you|o∪ৡ·Thank you|`*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was by now the dead of night, and while they were all capable of staying awake, most of the Thinkers that had attended the evening\'s celebration had elected to repose or at least relax in a communal rest area provided nearby. Ryouko had joined them, but had demurred on actually sleeping among so many aliens. It still unnerved her a bit, and frankly she had been having trouble sleeping recently, with Asami missing.

So instead, she read.

Interacting with Thinker machines was often fundamentally different from what she was used to. Many things were the same, of course---turning lights on, opening doorways, and other very basic commands were still "form a basic intent, and then receive the acknowledgment\", but where human machines rapidly switched over to the use of transmitted language as the concepts got more complicated, Thinker machines, with their use of telepathy, were able to maintain communication on a more conceptual level for far longer. A surprising example was simple climate control: as she had gotten more used to the controls, she had come to realize it was more than simply \"hotter\" or \"colder\". She could send a vague impression of *how* she was uncomfortable and the system would try to adapt. Though the first few tries had not been quite ideal.

Thus, while reading into Thinker archives often led to quick bursts of intuition, it was often hard to translate into a form that could be quickly relayed once they returned to Human space. Fortunately, that was the kind of task Clarisse could quietly, thanklessly, work at during her downtime.

*You do actually thank me, you know,* Clarisse thought.

*Well, probably not enough?* Ryouko thought.

*Then I might actually be looking forward to having a pref‐spec, Clarisse thought.

No further elaboration came, until at length Mountain‐wandering\'s granddaughter stirred, green‐skinned eyes peeling open slowly. They looked at each other for a moment.

*`∪?·What keeps you awake|∪?·What thinking fills your body`*

Ryouko considered dissembling, but decided against it. She knew Perspective‐pursuer really did want to learn what was on her mind.

*·The commonly‐accepted Human notion of long‐term stability turns out to be a controversial one within Consensus\|μ∈·Some Tentacles completely reject the idea that a \'final\' pref‐spec is desirable, with the eldest members even designing elaborate schemes to avoid the possibility\|μ∈·Some Tentacles, while embracing the notion of finding the best pref‐spec for oneself, differ considerably on what that means: whether to minimize it to almost nothing, to massively expand it, to align it with an external or even objective ideal; how much to focus on changing one\'s pref‐spec to match the world versus changing the world---or virtual world---to match one\'s pref‐spec; if an infinite cycle of pref‐specs is superior, if adopting or rejecting the pref‐specs of others is nobler, and on and on\|+·One thing is for certain: my species\' authorities were overconfident, enshrining long‐term stability as the ideal goal---I see no reason why Thinker philosophy would be inapplicable, and some of those espousing opposing philosophies are millennia older than we*

*`|⌃·To me personally, this long‐term‐stability you reference is undesirable, as it would be to most of /Somatic‐diversity, assuming I interpret it correctly|⌄·Your allies in /Ahimsa‐extending would mostly agree with your people's philosophers, of course|·It is rather uncivilized to impose a preference for it upon a whole species`*

Mountain‐wandering replied before Ryouko could, without even opening his eyes or moving.

*`|⌄+·We view the development of empathize‐open‐compliance as a civilizational achievement, one that has secured our Consensus in this universe|⌃+·But it nearly destroyed us first—we need not be so quick to condemn the survival practices of other sapients|·Not for a species structured as Humanity‐preserving has told us—they are more akin to a single, precarious Tentacle, forced to choose policies that prioritize stability above all else`*

Ryouko wasn\'t quite sure what to say to that. Moreover, what would she be doing, debating the structure of society across species with Mountain‐wandering? A worthwhile question, maybe, but one she felt ill‐equipped to speak on.

Still, she had to try.

*\|⌃·Our best historical models suggest that we were lucky to survive our own founding cataclysm\|⌄?·But was there a better way, given our starting conditions\|+·It is an impossible question*

*`|||●· ≈ seeking the bottom of the ocean`*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kuroi Abe had to admit, he had been surprised to be assigned to an active combat sector again after the Battle of Orpheus.

After all, they had dragged their feet quite a bit on putting him back on duty at all, leaving him cooling his heels well after he and his fellow doctors had deemed him fit for duty, which had been just a few days after his legs had visibly grown back after his injury on Apollo. If he didn\'t know better, he might have thought they were trying to keep one of Ryouko\'s relatives out of combat.

That kind of special treatment for relatives of magical girls was common and even tacitly acknowledged, but caused enough grumbling for Governance to at least try to be subtle about it. Perhaps that was why instead of garrison duty he had been assigned to combat duty on Persepolis, a contested frontier world in the Huanghe Sector.

Well, that, and the fact that Ryouko wasn\'t the emotionally sensitive type, he had thought with wry amusement. And as for Nana... she had long preferred to live her own life.

Across his months on Persepolis, the two sides had waged a pitched attritional battle both on ground and in space, but without massive fleets or sector‐wide stakes. They weren\'t even bleeding each other dry. Not with the manufacturing technology they had or the vast planetary reserves they could tap. In a way, they were just holding each other in place.

The days had passed quickly, without change, while for the rest of his family, events proceeded at a pace that felt dizzying to him. His younger daughter had gotten divorced, then moved to a new planet, then adopted a child. His granddaughter had been whisked away to perform secret research, surfaced briefly with his older daughter to liberate a rogue colony, disappeared to perform secret research again, and then abruptly died a hero\'s death.

For a dark few days, he had wondered how much longer it would be until he rejoined his wife and granddaughter, and how much he really cared to wait.

But Ryouko was... perhaps not dead, after all, and that made things different.

He could at least still enjoy a sandwich, and right now he was still on bereavement leave; his return to active assignment was still a few days away.

Medes, the second largest city on Persepolis, was home to a few hundred thousand hard‐scrabble colonists who had volunteered or been compelled by circumstances to linger on a planet under active invasion, helping to keep the local war economy moving along. Deep under the umbrella of their integrated air defenses, it was even relatively safe.

He made his way down a sidewalk on the outskirts of the city, absorbing glances and the occasional salute from the residents going about their business, most in a hurry---at this time of day, mid‐afternoon, there were few colonists with the leisure time to wander the streets. If you were out walking, you had business.

There were no children anywhere.

A bit further down Davani Street was a freshly fenced‐off section of rubble, the skeleton of a building still alive with drones moving debris and structural elements glowing infrared with the heat of self‐repair. It was a reminder that air attacks still sometimes got through.

The last time he had been here, when he had just returned, the building had been a recreation area, designated for indoor sporting events. The squid were no longer in the business of targeting irrelevant civilian structures, at least not while there was still a battle to win---but sometimes, things happened that neither side intended. Which said nothing about the *relevant* civilian structures.

He shuffled past it, past the trio of human workers supervising the cleanup, a holographic projection of a woman discussing the latest news from the front, which had at least been better of late. Past that, a flock of local waterfowl---loud, plumed, and exotic‐purple---squinted at him briefly, before returning to pecking at the grass.

He could never quite get used to how much nature there was in the city, relative to Mitakihara.

Finally, he reached his real destination, a small shop perched on the edge of the park, with signs advertising long sandwiches with kalbas and assorted vegetables. He had been here plenty of times before, but he always enjoyed it. That was reason enough to come back; he was also worried whether it was making money. He wasn\'t sure how he could tell.

The door made the sound of a bell ringing as he stepped in, shooing away the trio of birds waiting expectantly at the doorway, and he was mildly surprised to see two women standing inside the store, one of them squinting at the glass case. Neither had the look of locals *or soldiers, unusual on a planet that didn\'t exactly have many visitors.

It wasn\'t safe to guess just from appearance, so a quick nomenclator check verified his initial assessment. It was vague on their exact origins, but did identify them as working for one of the Governance‐subsidized private trading firms that serviced beleaguered colony worlds.

\"Good morning,\" he said in Japanese, taking advantage of their shared national origin.

\"Good morning,\" the woman at the case replied, looking up at him. Perhaps it was his imagination, but it seemed to him that her gaze held a bit too long for just a nomenclator scan.

Then she went back to the food, an assortment of deli meats, sausages, and cheeses.

\"Come here often?\" she asked.

\"As often as I can,\" Abe said. \"We can get what we want from the synthesizers at base, but I don\'t think it tops what they serve here.\"

\"It usually doesn\'t top the local stuff,\" the woman said. \"As long as you like what they\'re serving.\"

She stood up, glanced at her companion, then thrust out a hand for him to shake, interrupting the slight bow Abe had been about to perform.

\"Sato Reika,\" she said, smiling slightly. \"Ah, sorry, it\'s been a while. You mostly don\'t see that outside Earth, even on Suijin.\"

\"Right, of course,\" Abe said, shaking her hand after a moment.

He glanced at the woman\'s wife, who kept her mouth shut, but gave him a friendly look. She seemed to be distracted, perhaps listening to something via her implants.

It was more polite not to poke at it.

\"I can\'t shake the sense your name is familiar somehow,\" Reika said. "You\'re not secretly a celebrity, are you?\"

A series of thoughts quickly flashed through his mind: since all that had happened with Ryouko and the Cult, he had stayed scrupulously anonymous, refusing media interviews and departing Earth for Persepolis shortly after Ryouko\'s funeral. Few of those he served with here even knew about his connection to Ryouko---it didn\'t come up on the nomenclator.

\"No, just a soldier,\" he said, without even a noticeable hesitation. Benefit of age. \"Kuroi is a common surname.\"

\"Mmm. It really is different out here, isn\'t it? Even in the small colonies away from the front, everything is quiet and people don\'t feel any pressure. Not like here.\"

Before Abe could respond, the proprietor of the deli, Nahid, appeared behind the counter, carrying small sacks of meat in her arms.

\"Ah, I see you\'ve met our resident sandwich aficionado,\" she said, addressing Reika. \"I can\'t see the appeal of joining up myself, but I\'m glad he\'s here. If nothing else, so there\'s someone my age I can talk to. All I got around me otherwise are kids.\"

Nahid loved calling everyone under the age of two hundred \"kid\". One day a magical girl would \"kid\" her back; he suspected Nahid was looking forward to the resulting argument.

\"Well, I\'m privileged to be talking to you old‐timers then,\" Reika said. \"I was just telling Kuroi about how different the wartime pressure is here.\"

Abe\'s time in the military meant that he barely blinked at the sudden switch to Standard\'s insouciance.

He mulled over what to say, and how diplomatic to be about it, but Nahid surprised him by speaking first, and a torrent of words at that.

\"Listen, I don\'t know how exactly to put this but, Governance\'s job is difficult, and we understand we\'re all in this together. But those of us here are *way* more in it. I\'ve been here a long while, but I have friends that migrated inward; according to them, on some planets it\'s like there\'s no war at all! You can hardly say that here. Thanks to people like Abe, and the militia, we\'re not under direct fire here, but the planet is suffering. We used to get a lot of tourism from Earth, wanting to see the expatriate Persian culture, and a horde of exchange students. The schools aren\'t even open anymore.\"

Abe was glad she hadn\'t brought up the tensions between the militia and the better‐equipped core worlder units. Sure, they got the harder missions, but did that make much of a difference in a place like this?

But, as a shopkeeper, Nahid served both sides, and from her chats Abe had detected no resentment from *her* towards them, at least.

\"I\'ve heard some people say you had the option to leave and didn\'t take it,\" Reika said. \"\'Staying on a front‐line planet like this is obviously a noble decision, but it\'s still a decision.\'\"

That drew an eye‐roll.

\"Bullshit, if you\'ll pardon my language. It is a choice whose other side is abandoning your home and all you have known to start completely over. Even for us old ones who have done it once or twice already, it is no small decision. Many of us gave up what we knew to come here in the first place, half a century ago. We jumped at the chance to build and shape our own world. So saying we \'have a choice\' can only come from a place of ignorance, perhaps willful.\"

Abe looked off to the side. He had his own opinions, but there was a limit to how much he was willing to say in front of civilians, especially those not from the frontier.

\"A lot of this also has to do with Governance policy,\" Abe said, finally. \"Let\'s be honest. I know a lot of colonists wish Governance would mobilize a bit more aggressively, as a matter of respect rather than just material interest. Sure, there are practical reasons why not doing so insulates the main economy and Core Worlds from the impact of the war, but a lot of it is ideological. And because of that, it\'s easy to feel like no one in the rear understands the costs for those here. I understand why the Fleet doesn\'t arrive to clear the sky, but even those here who do want more acknowledgment.\"

Abe watched Reika mull their words over, then lean onto the counter, breaking up the increasingly tight circle the three of them were forming.

\"Thanks for your input,\" she said. \"I\'m afraid I\'m the curious type, and can\'t resist prying. So what are your thoughts on the big recent TCF news? It\'s a real big deal back in the Core, but I don\'t know how much it matters out here.\"

Her wife absentmindedly shook her head at her, amused.

\"It matters,\" Abe said, after a moment to process the change of subject. \"Though maybe not for the same reasons. I don\'t think any of us have ever considered Governance really *invincible,* no matter what they say. It\'s just a silly idea when the squid missiles are raining down on your head. But for those in the field, it\'s more about the idea that there\'s a fifth column working against us, working *with* the squid even. I\'m not sure how to express how insulting that is.\"

Reika stopped there, tapping a finger on the table. The silence stretched on, as she turned to her wife, then looked off into the middle distance, hand to her ear, gesturing that she was communicating remotely with something. Was it about work?

\"Sorry about that,\" she apologized finally. \"Well, what about this fascinating business with the Shizuki Ryouko girl? She\'s a hero to me no matter what, but can she really still be alive? What do you two think?\"

She spoke with the careful tenor of someone who had already concluded one way or the other, but didn\'t want to show it---Abe was in turn almost too startled by the mention of Ryouko to notice, trying to hide his emotion.

\"I doubt it. It sounds like gossip and fantasy to me, no offense,\" Nahid said. \"And I\'m not the only one that thinks that way. But I guess it\'s harmless stories to pass around. We all have our heroes; around here Admiral Mousavi is way more popular.\"

\"But doesn\'t it matter if Shizuki has found Cephalopods that aren\'t as hostile?\" Reika insisted. \"Senior military leadership is taking it seriously.\"

\"The *magical girls* are taking it seriously, you mean,\" Nahid said. "You know how worked up they get, about their old leader and the Cult and everything.\"

\"I\'ve seen enough Cult stuff to think maybe there is something to it. Maybe,\" Abe said. \"Not sure there\'s more to say than \'we\'ll see\', though.\"

He had felt the need to say *something*, if only to avoid looking suspicious. Perhaps it had been a mistake---it would have been safer to say something about Akemi at New Athens rather than look like a Cult apologist himself.

Just as he began to brace for questioning, Reika\'s wife suddenly straightened, meeting eyes with her.

\"I\'m sorry,\" Reika said, \"it looks like I need to get back on the job. Thanks for chatting!\"

\"No problem,\" he and Nahid said together, accidentally, as Reika and her wife turned abruptly and strode out the door.

\"Wonder what that was about,\" Abe said. \"Late for a meeting?\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Nahid said. \"Anyway, do you still want your sandwich?\"

He did indeed want his sandwich, and a short while later he made his way back out to the street, continuing past the shop in the direction of the city center. It was too early to head back to the barracks, so perhaps he would take a ride towards one of the amenity lounges. His calendar indicated that there was a group viewing of *Sun Over Glorieta*, billed as a post‐Unification Wars classic about star‐crossed lovers during the Desert Campaign in North America.

He had seen it of course. It was tremendously sappy, young couple kind of watching, which meant it gave him great nostalgia.

He had just made up his mind to call his ride when something made his hair stand on end, enough to stop him in his tracks when he realized it was *quite* literal.

He dove to the side and to the ground, planting himself into the permacrete. Only then did he try to figure it out what it was.

*A new weapon? Charged particles? What could---*

And then it was gone, leaving him the target of several curious onlookers. The civilians hadn\'t even felt it.

As he pushed himself up to his feet, wondering if he had suffered some kind of sensory malfunction, a series of tactical alarms seized his attention, literally taking control of his neural attention routines and dumping him into combat mode, so drastically that only a healthy provision of drugs and neural manipulation kept him from collapsing on the spot.

He was used to it, of course; it was hardly the first time.

Two blocks over, down a series of fortified passages, in an underground bunker, was a logistics center that processed weapons, supplies, and grief cubes. It had come under attack.

*Here, in the middle of the city?* a distant part of his mind asked, the processing thread quickly shunted aside and backgrounded, there to churn below his consciousness in synergy with the network. Perhaps the analysis would prove useful---only then would he become aware of it.

Squid infantry units had materialized out of nowhere in the tunnels a few minutes ago, disabling blast doors and cutting down all personnel. Some technological miracle had enabled them to bypass all safeguards and sensors---the breach had only just been discovered.

All of that burned through his mind as he sprinted down the street, past unaware civilians moving so slowly they looked frozen. He wasn\'t heading straight for the logistics center; instead, he was heading for the nearest civil defense depot, nestled in a former commercial center. Without his exoskeleton he could contribute nothing.

He threw himself into an armature on arrival, shoving his feet into proffered leg servos, and letting the machinery and drones around him work to move armor slabs into place, even as his arm, neck, and back ports integrated into the electronics. It was an older model, reserved here far from the front lines, but now really wasn\'t the time to quibble with the local equipment.

As he waited, a handful of other off‐duty soldiers rushed in, inserting themselves into the slots next to his. All told, there were four of them who could deploy in the next ten minutes, who would then be trailed by the local civil defense and personnel who had to travel from the next sector over. So, they would start with four.

They began moving even before all of their suits were fully assembled, moving over the terrain in great bursts of speed. There had been the possibility of waiting for more numbers, but the situation below was growing dire, the automated defenses falling apart against a threat that was really beyond their level. If they moved quickly, they might be able to stall the enemy a bit, perhaps as much as twenty minutes, long enough for more serious reinforcements to arrive. The local demon‐hunting magical girls numbered only three and were... barred from combat for psychiatric and other reasons. More suitable magical girls were, unfortunately, all at the front, and even with teleporters it would be a while before any would arrive.

And a delaying action was all it would be, frankly. One‐on‐one, they were no match for a squid commando, and the reports suggested there were eleven*.

*\"We\'ll be lucky even to survive,\"* one of the others commented. There was no venom or fear in his voice. In their current state, it was just a comment---but still one that showed where his thoughts were headed.

They split into groups of two, one for each of the downward passages, and he and his partner Trang made their way to the nearby subway entrance, jumping down the stairs in one go.

There, they paused for a moment, taking up a position next to the blast door that led further down. According to the records, it had been opened twenty minutes ago to allow a few personnel to begin their shifts.

*\"Most likely how they got in,\"* Trang commented. *\"Might be worth reviewing security procedures.\"*

From here they could pick up a few faint transmissions, dead or disabled civilians whose implants were still intact enough to provide some sensory intel. From them, they could tell that the immediate entryway seemed clear. Seemed.

A quick communications burst between him and Trang, and then with the other two, set the plan in place, and he took point, turning the corner, sensors bristling, suit‐mounted rifle ready to fire.

Nothing he could see, and Trang followed him after he had stepped forward a bit. Two was hardly an ideal number for this, and there had been some consideration placed toward going in one entrance as a group of four, but Command had decided for them. A squid infiltration like this was a high‐asset operation, one that didn\'t seem to make any sense. That alone made it worth quashing, gathering whatever intel they could from the squid involved. They couldn\'t risk the squid simply getting out the other door.

He advanced forward, his TacComp simulating the tactical options. If it was at all possible, they would endeavor to make the squid come to them*, into prepared positions infested with their drones. But if they simply sat back, the enemy would finish whatever business they had below, which might be unacceptable. They would have to poke the squid, doing whatever damage they could without exposing their limited numbers.

At a thought, half a dozen drones no larger than a grape apiece dropped out of a back compartment, scurrying along the floor to search for good spots to hide while drawing supplemental power from the grid. When the time came, each would empty everything it had into the nearest enemy drone or shield as a millisecond laser burst, potentially disabling a small drone outright---or, with coordination, a group might help take down a squid personal shield for a few moments.

He was aiming more for the anti‐drone role, though, given that he was limited to his personal inventory. He would sprinkle them liberally all along his way in, then Trang would start dropping her heavier‐hitting anti‐personnel devices when they got close. When the firing started, they could withdraw into them, hopefully earning a good deal of time.

As they moved downward, he paid careful attention to the telemetry coming from below. The base defenses were doing their job, sealing corridors and transmitting as much information on the enemy\'s location as they could. Unfortunately, Command still had no idea what the squid were doing here. Destroying one logistics center couldn\'t possibly be worth the trouble or risk, and would have been better handled by planting a large explosive device and leaving. Instead, the squid seemed to be looking for something.

The lack of certainty made it difficult to predict their behavior, a tactical liability.

They emerged into the bunker\'s primary layer, and Abe grimly cast his sensors over a small corridor of broken bodies, still glowing faintly in infrared. He kept his weapon up and pointed, grenade launcher primed and aimed. Squid special forces they might have been, but this whole base was still *human* ground, the walls, circuitry, and even bodies of their allies all casting interference at the squid sensors. The squid hadn\'t had time to *really* take over. With that edge, they might even hope to achieve surprise.

He let out a breath, letting his suit silence the noise. He couldn\'t get *too* confident. There just might be a squid or two still stealthed, waiting for a response just like theirs.

*No need to do anything rash. We\'re taking care of this.*

Only his combat mode kept him from jerking with surprise, his TacComp working through the basic reasoning faster than his own brain could. He had been around enough magical girls to know what telepathy felt like, but there wasn\'t supposed to be anyone around---no IFF, nothing on the local net, and even Command seemed confused. Was there some kind of squid interference?

Plus, the voice felt familiar.

*Roger that. Verify identity? Unable to connect,* he thought.

Abe cast that thought nowhere in particular, assuming the other party would read it.

*Will not verify. Hold your position. Will connect for sensor telemetry.*

*Will not verify*. He knew what that implied. Some kind of MagOps? That was theoretically possible, but nowadays the kinds of roles where a secret identity would matter were few and far between. Maybe on a rogue colony, or something to do with the TCF conspiracy, but here?

He and Trang had the same thought: ultimately, it didn\'t matter. They were friendly. No squid could forge magical girl telepathy. Even Command agreed.

They withdrew behind the last doorway and waited a few seconds, and just as his more distant subroutines began to entertain more paranoid possibilities, the connection finally registered. The handshake was valid, but the connection was restricted, giving him only limited tactical information.

That was enough, as a moment later three unidentified magical girls appeared on his facility map and began engaging the squid, whose location they had somehow deduced. His auditory relays picked up the sudden fusillade of explosions, gunfire, and what sounded like thunder, while his TacComp began receiving data from suborned squid drones near the battle.

Why were they here? How had they gotten here first? There would be time to sort that out afterward. For now, Abe and Trang still had a role to play.

Trang began to distribute her remaining drones and mines around the area, specialized anti‐personnel, preparing for the possibility that some of the squid might try to escape out to the surface through their corridor.

As he kept watch, a couple of shaped charges nestled themselves into one the ubiquitous drone shafts, waiting for a chance to emerge. A few others moved to the ceiling, waiting for the signal to drop a wall of sensor interference.

Then, they waited.

Things were quiet at first, then some of the perimeter drones began encountering squid counterparts, exchanging bursts of millisecond laser fire and electronic warfare. The air started filling with electricity again---he realized now, it might be from one of the magical girls. The fighting was definitely moving in their direction.

Even in post‐battle analysis, he would never be quite sure why he looked where he did.

Perhaps some distant thread of thought in his TacComp had noticed an anomaly in enemy drone behavior, or perhaps there had been a slight change in the pitch of the gunfire. Whatever the case was, he happened to glance in direction of one of the large drone shafts, and noticed a slight electromagnetic shimmer, an irregularity highlighted by the unusually charged air.

He jumped backward even as a spray of armor‐piercing rounds hit his position, several of them hitting home among his leg servos and one reaching tissue in his leg, stopping dead as it cracked his reinforced bone. He felt none of it, Trang\'s gunfire ringing in his ears as the drones converged, an ominous squid figure sparking into view under the physical attack. An explosion on the squid\'s back got through the shield but was too spent to penetrate the armor.

The squid lunged at him, closing the distance. It was the correct move, keeping him from withdrawing into potentially more prepared defenses and instead pitting squid armor against human armor---as long as the squid could finish the job before Trang could intervene.

He dropped his gun and tried to level his close‐quarters laser cutters, but the squid was too fast. He was able to keep the squid\'s own weapons off of him as they grappled each other, but that was it.

But even as he pushed his reactors into redline, he was unable to resist the crushing force. He felt his right arm begin to fail, and then his shoulder joint released itself to save the arm---but that allowed a laser and composite blade to slice off his other one. Warnings and pain flared through his consciousness, and for a moment his vision was filled with Trang desperately emptying her weapon, enemy drones nearly overwhelming her.

Rather than kill him, the commando suddenly lifted him off the ground, and began sprinting down the corridor with him in tow. Was it using his broken body as cover?

Then, in a flash of color, it was over---not for him, but for the squid, who no longer had a head, and whose chest cavity had been torn open, giving him the briefest glimpse of someone\'s unarmored fist. He didn\'t have to be told that this was no ordinary human feat.

Regaining his footing he jumped backward, the explosion that followed rattling his skull. Within seconds, he knew, the squid\'s implants and technology would begin digesting itself under a swarm of nanites.

He rapidly scanned his surroundings, but it seemed the corridor had been cleared, even the drones disabled. The girls that had saved them were already gone, leaving Trang sputtering, but he had finally realized something.

The voice in his head had been \"Reika\".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*\"Suppose we need to go on a dangerous mission to aid Ryouko,\" Simona said, \"but you\'re not allowed to go because Governance considers you too valuable to the wormhole project. Would you break orders to do it?\"*

*\"In a vacuum, if it were so black and white, I\'d have to say yes,\" Asami said. \"But in practice, I doubt the context would be so simple. What about you? If I went to the Ribbon and the Goddess you don\'t quite believe in told me you had to do something against orders, would you do it?\"*

*\"Well, like you said, it\'s an oversimplification, but my baseline would be yes. I told you, I\'m accepting, provisionally, that she might provide good advice, even if she\'s just a magic ghost or something. What about if Akemi Homura asked us to go?\"*

*\"I thought you didn\'t like her.\"*

*\"If she asks, she\'d have a convincing reason.\"*

*\"Then yes. That\'s kind of a stupid question.\"*

*\"I think you\'re underestimating the ability of an Ancient, especially Akemi Homura, to make anything sound convincing. You can\'t make that your only criterion.\"*

At Simona\'s urging, they had spent hours discussing what they would do in every possible contentious scenario, from being told they had to help the TCF terrorists to save Ryouko\'s life---they\'d try to find an alternative and betray at the first opportunity---to encountering a strange, potentially‐brainwashed Ryouko.

They had reached some kind of common ground, at least. Despite their clear differences in life experience and approach, there wasn\'t much they\'d do differently, most of the time. Simona seemed to enjoy focusing on the most paranoid and outré scenarios, but that made sense, given where she came from. And, Asami had to admit, after what they had been through so far, anything seemed possible. It couldn\'t hurt to be more prepared.

For example, if Ryouko seemed to have been brainwashed by the aliens or the TCF conspiracy, their approach would involve working together with Clarisse if possible, Simona using her anti‐magic to purge any possible harmful magic, and jointly insisting Ryouko perform a Satti head‐heal to eliminate any technological or biological meddling, ideally with trained healers and telepaths on hand.

As for the strange organ in Ryouko\'s head... Homura had put it there, and Ryouko\'s magic hadn\'t rejected it, so they shouldn\'t try to remove it unless they had no other choice.

And if the real, uncoerced Ryouko wanted something they didn\'t want for her---for instance, to stay with the aliens---then they could hear her out.

\"And if we disagree, but it\'s her real decision, she has her own autonomy,\" Asami insisted. \"We can\'t just kidnap her.\"

\"As long as it\'s freely made,\" Simona said, looking to the side for a moment.

\"But look, \" she continued. \"It\'s not always so easy to distinguish between a real choice or desire, and a product of manipulation. I was born and raised as an agent for Homura. She\'s the one who assigned me to Ryouko. I suspect she knew quite well I\'d fall in love with her. So is my love for her fake? Is there any really objective answer to that?\"

It bothered Asami when Simona talked so casually about still being in love with her girlfriend, but, in a way, the honesty was better than the alternative.

\"I mean, if you\'re saying Homura manipulated you into that, that\'d be an argument for accepting Ryouko\'s choices despite manipulation,\" Asami said. \"*Or* an argument that I should try to deprogram you. I\'m not sure that is quite where we want to go with this.\"

Simona frowned.

\"It just occurred to me that we don\'t know how old individual Cephalopods are. It\'s bad enough trying to deal with manipulative Ancients a few hundred years old, Ryouko may be dealing with aliens that are *truly* old. On her own, too.\"

\"She has Clarisse, I suppose,\" Asami said. \"And besides, if the squid are master manipulators, they certainly haven\'t shown it in this war.\"

\"That assumes the goal is to win the war,\" Simona said. \"Isn\'t there a *lot* of speculation as to why they might not be trying that hard?\"

\"But what the heck would be the point then?\"

\"I don\'t know,\" Simona admitted, shrugging with her hands. \"Maybe it has something to do with what the TCF conspiracy is up to?\"

Asami sank back into her seat, frustrated, even as Simona continued:

\"These people are everyone\'s enemy, but I don\'t think they\'re just alien lackeys. I can\'t imagine they don\'t have their own plan, their own agenda for Humanity. They\'ve got to have made some kind of deal with a few of the aliens, sure, but how can they be sure that deal will be honored? They can\'t. They must have their own power base, something that could impose costs on the aliens if the deal were to be broken. What is that if not the rest of Humanity?\"

\"You\'re making way too many assumptions about things we just can\'t know,\" Asami said. \"Who knows what they\'ve traded for, or if they even intend to stay Human at the end of it. Maybe the deal is they get a ship to some distant galaxy and make their own Humanity. We can\'t know. Yet.\"

\"The frustrating thing is I\'m virtually certain Homura knows the answers to some of these questions,\" Simona said. \"Valentin always seemed like she had a good sense of their intentions.\"

\"With the Goddess\'s other Ribbon, I\'m sure she could know all kinds of things,\" Asami said. \"But you\'re probably right that there\'s limits to the TCF conspiracy\'s cooperation with the squid. I just don\'t get what their goal is. Kill or control all their political opponents with the squids\' help, and then betray them in order to lead Humanity to victory?\"

Simona bit her lip.

\"I can\'t shake the feeling that we might just not be thinking big enough. But, obviously we just don\'t have enough information. Yes, I know, you said that already.\"

A moment passed.

\"The problem is, if we do run into a difficult situation involving Ryouko, we likely *also* won\'t have enough information,\" Simona continued. \"What if we don\'t have the chance to learn what she really wants? If her life is in the balance, how do we choose? We can\'t fall back to letting her make the decision if we don\'t know which choice she\'d prefer.\"

Asami considered that, then realized the answer was surprisingly simple.

\"I\'d do what the Ryouko I love would want me to do.\"

\"Even if it killed her?\" Simona asked.

\"Even then,\" Asami said. \"I could never live with myself, but it\'d be the only answer.\"

She looked Simona in the eye, daring the other girl to disagree. Simona visibly let out a breath.

\"Well,\" she said. \"I wish I had your level of clarity there. Logic says you\'re right. But I\'m not sure I\'m ready to commit to that.\"

\"Too bad,\" Asami said, force suddenly entering her voice. \"Commit to it anyway. That\'s the whole point of this exercise, isn\'t it? We make the hard decisions now, so we don\'t have to fight it out later. Right?\"

In truth, Asami wasn\'t sure she should be pressuring Simona. Simona had already admitted her mistakes at the pulsar, and had also admitted the importance of listening to Ryouko\'s preferences.

But not entirely. She always seemed to leave herself an out. How could Asami trust her, then?

\"That was my plan, yes,\" Simona said. \"But I just can\'t conceive of letting Ryouko die, even if she\'s okay with it. Akemi Homura had a line about that. Sometimes the hardest thing is to let someone do what they want to. She said everyone struggles with that sometimes.\"

Simona smiled crookedly.

\"Maybe it\'s a good thing Ryouko has two of us after all. You can do what she would want you to do. I\'ll do whatever it takes to keep her alive. Together, we can achieve both.\"

Asami sighed. Maybe their differences really were irreconcilable.

\"Or neither, because we\'re too busy fighting each other. I don\'t think an aphorism is going to make things magically work out.\"

\"Of course not,\" Simona said. \"But we\'ve agreed now on plans for most of the plausible scenarios. I think we\'re just going to have to be satisfied with that. What else can you expect?\"

Asami grit her teeth. Why did she live in a world where Simona could be right?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryouko had been in more than her fair share of experimental study chambers, and this latest one was not terribly different from what she was used to. Austere, variable‐free aesthetics, mysterious measurement equipment that occasionally protruded from the walls, and even a familiar observation room. However, she had to admit that this was the first one that resonated telepathically, the equipment filling her mind with a sense of distant murmuring.

In addition, there was... something uncanny about one of the instruments, a thin metal rod that drew her attention, seeming to hum ominously in her mind. It made sense once it was explained to her that this* was the experimental reality‐warping detector, one whose technology they demurred on describing.

She had to admit to feeling a tinge of nervousness when the time came, asked to teleport between two chambers for the first time in far too long, under the expectant---and very wide---eyes of a group of alien children, and under a barrage of active sensors, some of which she could feel, and some she knew she couldn\'t.

She couldn\'t help but think of the blink interdictors at the pulsar. If this wasn\'t a friendly test, it might be difficult to escape the test chamber.

But everything was fine in the end, to her at least. Fewer than a hundred meters, barely an effort at all, but she could hear the instruments in her new location chattering in shock, even as a bright set of colors spun across the limbs of the kids. It was a full five minutes before the scientists gave her leave to demonstrate a bit more "reality‐warping\", which gave Perspective‐pursuer plenty of time to pepper her with questions about how it felt to use magic.

The second demonstration meant putting on a safe show of summoning and dismissing her arbalest, some mild telekinesis, and performing a short‐range teleport of the reality‐warping detector. She could only speculate on what the aliens could possibly get from the data, though they had promised to share anything of real value. The diplomatic gesture of \"safe\" reality‐warping was the real point, and the Thinkers seemed suitably impressed.

In truth, it was valuable for her too. She felt a little rusty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She passed the time over the next few days in plenty of ways; it turned out /Somatic‐diversity was well‐versed in outdoor activities, and Mountain‐wandering had cleared his schedule to show her around.

They started with an outdoor grill. Shortly after their emergence on land, the Thinkers had mastered fire, a development to which they credited a sudden growth in intellect thanks to their newfound ability to cook and roast fish and plants. Indeed---and here Mountain‐wandering seemed ready, even eager, to share---the newfound access to calories was credited with driving early Thinker ventures into agriculture and aquaculture, helping them colonize what little land was available on Great Sea.

All of that meant that raw and cooked seafood stood side‐by‐side in Thinker culture, the former the province of childhood memories and deep sea hunts, the latter that of beachside roasts, replete with seagrasses and local land beasts. Of course, in the culture of /Somatic‐diversity specifically, greater affinity with the land was a feature of many bauplans, and there was a great appreciation for the bounty of the land, as evidenced by the feast Ryouko had been served on first arrival.

Ryouko couldn\'t help but stare expectantly as Mountain‐wandering narrated all of that, turning over skewers of fish and roasting meats mounted above a pile of burning coals.

*·No one at home will be convinced of my experiences here without a great deal of evidence\|+∪·This is not how anyone imagined the Thinkers to be\|+∪·No one would have imagined any of you engaging in recreational grilling*

*`·None of you are to be blamed for drawing inferences about us from what is most salient||·The rest of your species has only encountered /Thinker‐preserving, which has always been uniquely focused on conflict, and because you do not value diversity like we do, you do not anticipate it`*

He paused for a moment while he rotated some of the food, then continued:

*`μ·/Truth‐seeking has plenty to say on this matter, but it is the province of all sapient life to decide what it cares about, how it chooses to shape the world|ν·Pure evolutionary pressure would lead to reproduction‐maximizers, an existence devoid of meaning—it is relieving that the first sapient species we encountered did not fall prey to that trap either|μ·Our preferences are rich ≈ mature ecosystem—though partly serendipitous, they largely reflect the accumulated choices of the species, the Tentacle, and the individual|ν·We have devoted great effort to ensuring pref‐spec integrity and continuity, making the most of our existence`*

Ryouko had to stop and take that in, blinking a few times. There were many who would say \"meaning\" could not be defined without emotion.

*μ?·How do you define purpose without reference to an objective source\|\|\|*

Mountain‐wandering didn\'t answer right away, instead pulling a few skewers of fish off the fire, handing them to a waiting drone for distribution to the local family group.

*`μ·Purpose is different for every Tentacle, often every individual, precisely because there is no objective source|ν?·For /Somatic‐diversity, the breadth and depth of physical sensory experience is important—how can one choose a purpose without first making full contact with the world in which we live|ν⌄·Without embodiment, most of us consider even the most exotic experiences pointless|ν⌃·Most Thinkers are virtualized and, of course, disagree`*

This, perhaps, was alien wisdom, but it was curious to consider the overlap with Governance ideology, which also discouraged virtualization and encouraged embodiment for humans. The difference was that Governance espoused---no, *imposed*---a very specific, limited embodiment upon Humanity. She had always known that, of course; Governance hardly bothered to hide it from anyone paying attention. But having the basis for comparison gave her a feeling of restriction that felt all the more acute.

What exactly did Governance, and even the MSY, push? A steady life, a consistent life, stable for the long‐term. Simple, traditional human wants and needs. Life in a city, with plenty of amenities and entertainment, and a family. Maybe.

It suited many, perhaps even the vast majority of humans, but it was easy to find those who disagreed. Those who headed for the frontier colonies, those who joined the military, and at the far extreme, the rogue colonies. Wasn\'t it the Goddess herself who had implied that humans weren\'t suited to stasis?

In a different world, in a different society, would she even have wanted to make a wish?

After a few seconds, she spotted Survival‐Optimizer trudging towards her, bulky legs sending a slight shudder through the dirt. Two of his tentacles carried a ceramic platter piled high with assorted leaves and what looked like leeks, fire‐roasted. Though, she knew /Ahimsa‐extending generally avoided eating even root vegetables, whose harvesting killed the plant, so they probably weren\'t exactly like leeks.

*`μ·I was summoned to provide an alternate perspective|||`*

He waited until she acknowledged she understood.

*`|ν+·We do not share such a rigid focus on sapience, which can only be an arbitrary line drawn to exclude lesser forms of sentience based only on computational resources, which is a fluke of evolution—simpler purposes are still purposes|ν·Most Tentacles agree that the existing nature of the universe carries no excessive preference weight—it is well that we shape the world with our choices|ξ·I am reminded of a sense I have had before, that not only are you dissatisfied with your own pref‐spec, you are dissatisfied with that of your own species`*

Mountain‐wandering replied before Ryouko could.

*`|ν+∈·Perhaps the line may be arbitrary, but some practical line must be chosen—there are forms of life which are little different from complex chemistry, and even you consume most plants|ν∈·The existing state of the universe may not be strongly preferred, but it must be acknowledged|ξ·Both can be solved by using your empathy‐organ to adjust your preferences, but you are wise not to do so lightly|ν+∈·We are not ignorant of the value of lesser sentiences—by sharing the sensoriums of all life, we obtain a deeper understanding of them than you can`*

Ryouko considered denying what the pair had said about her dissatisfaction, or simply letting the comments pass, pretending that the multiple threads going multiple ways were still overwhelming her. At this point, though, she doubted she would really fool them, and it was possible lying would even be counterproductive.

She found herself making that calculation all too often these days.

*\|ξ·As you know, we are a monolith---our dominant preference‐cluster was decided by a few after a species‐wide war, with stability and broad acceptance as the goals\|ξ+∈·This process was inexact, incredibly so by your standards, and some individuals are not happy with the outcome---and, perhaps, never could be, except by reality‐distortion\|ξ+∈·I confess that I have considered that my pref‐spec might not fit within that preference‐cluster, but I am not sure---after all, human preferences are more fluid and contingent on circumstance than yours are, especially when young\|*

She wasn\'t sure if she was being coherent, and she switched between alien‐friendly concepts---\"preference‐cluster\" instead of ideology, for instance---and human concepts like happiness. She had already defined a few core human emotions for /Ahimsa‐extending\'s sake, but the precise meaning could only ever be inexact. Not even direct thought transmission could cross this gap---the aliens simply couldn\'t experience emotions as humans did.

And even now, she avoided some topics. For instance, the fact that many Earthers joined the military, and subsequently died, in part because they had no alternate \"Tentacle\" where they could thrive. That was not something /Ahimsa‐extending needed to hear.

In the meantime, Survival‐Optimizer had replied to Mountain‐wandering:

*`|ν·As always with such matters, there is a tradeoff between the needs of our species, and the needs of others—it is no virtue to ignore the needs of others in your calculations|ν+·You know /Truth‐seeking's thought‐experiment demonstrating implicit obligation to combine all sapience into one supersapience, if you weigh sapience too highly||ν·Understanding without action ≈ one‐who‐fails‐to‐pursue‐their‐own‐preference`*

It seemed not even the aliens were immune to incredibly abstract philosophical thought experiments, Ryouko thought.

Mountain‐wandering replied:

*`||ν·Only /Truth‐seeking would take such an abstraction seriously, and we consider the problem solved with sufficient weighting||ν·I think we have exposed Humanity‐preserving and Ryouko‐supporting to enough recapitulation of known arguments`*

Survival‐Optimizer implicitly agreed with a gesture, then switched to Ryouko\'s topic:

*`|ξ·Perhaps‒57% in time we could help your species form a better system—this is our wish, but we know better than to expect it to happen trivially|ξ·Perhaps‒68% we could allow emigration to Consensus—under certain requirements—for those Humans whose preferences are not tolerated by your society||`*

Now they were back to discussing brass tacks about Governance, but that was a dicey topic, and not the core of her concern anyway. So, she tried to redirect the conversation.

*?·How do you think an individual should choose to live, if they cannot satisfy their own preferences\|+·This is a question that vexes many humans, that many fail to answer*

It took a while for either of the aliens to answer. Longer, in fact, than in response to any previous question she had asked. Survival‐Optimizer even made a downward gesture with one tentacle, which had the same meaning as a human raising one finger---\"please wait\".

*`μ·Full virtual reality, memory editing, or similar measures can achieve a fully realized pref‐spec for some, but not for most—a less intrusive method, with careful planning and optimization by your Tentacle and deep calculation, is acceptable to many, but typically only to a limited degree|ν·The most common solution is to modify your preferences so that they are achievable—this is not so limiting a requirement in our civilization as it would be in yours|ν+∀·Most Tentacles tend toward this category, including both of ours|ξ·For the sake of completion, we must observe that a few Tentacles prefer eventual individual archival or aestivation, though we have no desire to exposit their philosophy to you|ο·Some individuals choose to simply bear unsatisfied preferences—this is common in Tentacles like /Truth‐seeking`*

Here Survival‐Optimizer spoke for both of them, having evidently consulted on the statement.

Ryouko wasn\'t sure what she had expected, nor did she quite know what she had received. She could understand that most Tentacles chose to stay out of a passive, pointless virtual paradise, or even a government‐engineered physical one, but it seems those who had chosen otherwise had answers very similar to humanity. You either had to give up on your dreams, or hold on to them anyway without reasonable expectation of success. And the notion of deliberately accepting or even seeking your own end or termination... was not acceptable to Governance, but consistent with some old Human ideas.

*So they have no good answer,* Clarisse thought. *Is that really surprising? As long as you seek to have no end, only the long‐term stable can be satisfied. That\'s either the ones who are stable now, or the ones whose preferences can stay bounded. Otherwise, dissatisfaction is a fact of life. That\'s how I see it. That\'s why no one should pitch the idea that a single Incubator wish will fix all that ails you.*

Ryouko wasn\'t sure she agreed with, or even fully understood what Clarisse was trying to say. While it was true wishes weren\'t a panacea, wasn\'t magic all about rejecting the impossible? She wasn\'t as well‐versed in the philosophy of magic as she should have been, as a representative of the MSY to Consensus, but she felt that magical girls had a better answer than the Thinkers did.

On the other hand, it sure didn\'t seem like many of the Ancients she knew had their lives better figured out than the Thinkers did. She had empathize‐opened both Survival‐Optimizer and Mountain‐wandering, and while she couldn\'t do the same for her mentors Mami and Kyouko, she was certain the latter were rather more dissatisfied with themselves and their lives than the former.

She couldn\'t help but wonder if she wouldn\'t be better off in Thinker society, if she managed to end the war. Survival‐Optimizer was right about one thing for sure: there were more options here. /Star‐faring in particular had a certain allure...

Ryouko cut that thought off at the root. Whatever the reasons---whatever the thoughts of the girl that made her wish---she could not. Not while she had work to do, and not without Asami.

She realized that she had been standing there in silence a while, as the two aliens looked down upon her, one yeti‐like, the other more of a cylinder, both almost eldritch, behind a cozy campfire and grill. It was like a fever dream.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After that, the days passed with an odd serenity, as if she were taking the kind of alien vacation she had once always dreamed about. Survival‐Optimizer invited her onto one of his own local expeditions, gathering specimens of local plants for shipment back to Ahimsa‐extending, part of an ongoing agreement with /Somatic‐diversity. Survival‐Optimizer seemed to make a point of emphasizing that this was not strictly necessary---/Ahimsa‐extending already had specialists with existing arrangements in the area---but that he simply wanted to. It was an activity that he preferred, exploring new types of flora.

He also pointed out that her pref‐spec implied she would enjoy the activity too---usually. It also indicated that she would enjoy it more in the presence of her missing life‐partner.

It felt strange, having this alien try to advise her on her happiness. It was also a bit embarrassing, knowing that her pref‐spec twigged her that* well. She found that she *had* developed a taste for roaming around an alien forest, peering at strange broom‐like fungi and the pudgy rodents that hid underneath.

There was a placid meditativeness to it, a satisfaction that came with successfully sealing each new specimen into its maintenance pod, and she felt guilty enjoying it without Asami there to share it.

And then, the evening after that, she stayed out with the Thinker youth to study the stars of Andromeda. Perhaps it would have been more romantic without the handy internal guide to star names and constellations, but it was still interesting in its own right, especially that the Thinkers even *had* constellations. Perspective‐pursuer explained that early Thinkers had held plenty of animist and nearly‐religious theories about the world that were perfectly consistent with the idea that shapes in the stars might have meaning.

So the time passed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asami tapped her fingers against the side of the faux window, looking out into the simulated depths of space.

Well, not quite the depths of space. They were pulling up on the edges of the Karun system, and from here she could pick out the local star and even see some of the planets, including their destination, the planet Persepolis---though that admittedly required asking the ship to point it out to her.

The trip here had given Simona and her plenty of time to argue the ins and outs of future arrangements, but now she wanted to focus her mind on the upcoming mission. This latest incident, an unusual attack by alien commandos foiled by mysterious magical girls, fit squarely into her group\'s purview, and that was before one considered the grief cube supply chain angle. The lines of evidence pointed toward Akemi Homura\'s involvement, and despite the apparent lack of direct targeting, the presence of Ryouko\'s grandfather in the incident was... concerning. It made for a pattern of unusual attacks not just on Ryouko herself, but on her family members, considering alien commandos were also responsible for the death of Ryouko\'s grandmother and her company in the Pollux shipyard.

Was it more evidence of coordination between the TCF conspiracy and the squid, one that Homura had needed to intervene against? Why did Ryouko\'s family matter once again, or could it be just a coincidence?

It hadn\'t been obvious that the magical girls which had rescued Abe were Homura\'s at first, but the conclusion was clear: \"Sato Reika\", by personality, appearance, and magic, was clearly none other than the missing Ancient Yasuhiro Rin, bringing along her wife Jeannette Smith. And the particular electricity magic Abe had witnessed confirmed Misa Virani\'s involvement.

Yuma had been furious. Rin and Jeannette had been part of her inner circle when investigating the TCF conspiracy, and either Homura had recruited them out from under her, or they had been Homura\'s the whole time.

What did it all mean? There were plenty of theories to sift through, but by now the leading edge of evidence collection was complete; they were there to see if there was anything *left*, and anything that might be learned by, say, infiltrating the local alien force, with the assistance of the spec ops unit traveling with them.

Not that *she* would be involved in anything so dangerous, or even be allowed to go on‐planet. No, she and her wormhole powers were too valuable, so she would stay in orbit on the cruiser HSS Mandela, which could exit the system at the first sign of trouble.

She sensed Simona approaching, the soul gem signature veering down the corridor towards her alcove.

\"What\'s this about?\" she asked, before Simona even turned the corner.

\"The AIs are working on their analysis of the sensor data from the logistics facility,\" Simona said, without missing a beat. \"This is from reflective reconstruction, hot off the press.\"

Asami had to look up what \"reflective reconstruction\" even meant, and learned that it was a term for squeezing extra information from streams of raw sensor data, in forms that weren\'t intended in the design of the sensor itself. For instance, from secondary or tertiary reflections after an initial reflection of off a wall or other object, hence the term. Though in practice, the name was outmoded and that simple‐sounding idea---when it involved numerous sensors, enemy interference, excessive noise and other factors---became horrendously complicated, and was now a field dominated by AIs.

But by then Simona had already sat down beside her, calling up a hologram to play on the ship\'s wall, heedless of passerby, who would have all been cleared anyway.

The holostream did not make for simple viewing, labeled as a partial reconstruction of alien activity inside a storage area where all direct sensors and drones had been destroyed or disabled. As such, it was low resolution and smeared, with entire swathes of voxels marked up with probability indicators and other metadata, as well as entire invisible sectors, which were difficult to render properly in three dimensions.

She had only a breakneck training in forensics to lean on, but with her implants clearing away some of the confusing data, she was able to spot the central point: this was a recording of alien commandos interacting with a large, round storage container, shaped like an archaic furnace. In the recording, what it held was blurred out, but she knew a grief cube reliquary when she saw one.

\"They\'re... picking up grief cubes?\" she said, still trying to turn that over in her mind. \"But why? How?\"

The aliens had never shown any evidence of being able to see or detect grief cubes, and it had appeared that they could not even interact with them. There had been occasional reported alien attempts to investigate or study magical girl logistics, but...

\"Not just that,\" Simona said, fussing with the perspective of the holostream. \"Two decades, and this is the most understanding they\'ve ever shown, *and* they\'re touching the damn things. It *means something. Especially after the incident near the asteroid.\"

By that, she meant the Cephalopods being affected by demons on the alien cruiser Yuma and Kyouko had boarded. What did it mean? There was one possible answer staring them in the face.

\"Could these Cephalopods be more Human‐like somehow?\" Asami asked. "Modified to interact more with grief‐based constructs?\"

*More emotional?* she thought, but did not say. It was a natural leap of logic, but seemed too speculative for the evidence they had.

\"Maybe,\" Simona said. \"That\'s one hypothesis. It would be a dangerous, disturbing development, potentially war‐relevant. It\'s already making its way up the chain of command.\"

\"Then it hardly seems like a coincidence Akemi got involved,\" Asami said. \"Though, apparently she didn\'t think it was worth intervening in the other two raids.\"

There had been two other squid raids on grief cube storage sites, in different systems. Those had been complete successes for the enemy, unfortunately---almost no surveillance data, or much of anything else, had survived. Whatever grief cubes had been on‐site were missing. They had only been stopped where Homura\'s agents had intervened.

\"How did they know to even *be* here?\" Simona asked.

\"How do they know anything?\" Asami shot back.

An empty retort, but Simona knew what she meant.

\"Anything else?\" Asami asked, after a moment.

\"Not really,\" Simona sighed. \"The alien self‐destruct sequence is as effective as always, and we don\'t understand enough about their advanced biotech to infer anything conclusive. Some of the commandos\' genetic material seems novel, but novel in what way? It\'s not unusual for Spec Ops to have unusual enhancements. Even ours do.\"

Asami knew more than most about Spec Ops bioenhancements, but held her tongue. Simona had mostly learned to stop lecturing Asami about topics she already understood; it was best she reciprocated, a little.

Fully understanding an alien creature\'s biology to the point of running biotech‐caliber studies took considerable time and study, and that was without* implants, bioenhancements, and deliberate obfuscation. Two decades of war had given Governance little true comprehension of the Cephalopods.

\"So then we wait,\" Asami said, \"or you find something on‐planet that makes this trip worth it.\"

She turned her head toward the viewing pane, where the dot of Persepolis was now clearly visible and growing in size. Local space was serene at a glance, but for the rest of them, just making it through orbit wasn\'t entirely without risk, even with their healthy complement of escorts.

\"You better get going,\" Asami said. \"Don\'t get yourself killed.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simona was already unhappy by the time she landed. Or perhaps frustrated* was the better term.

The locals had done everything by the book. The problem was, the book emphasized getting everything back up and running, *not* facilitating an upcoming investigation. As far as they were concerned, the \"mysterious magical girl team\" that had intervened in the attack was clearly just some MagOps group, and it had taken quite a while for someone senior enough to know otherwise to intervene. By then, the site had been contaminated---a downside to the continued secrecy surrounding Homura\'s actions.

The MSY investigation team that followed had done all they could. Clairvoyant‐enhanced telepathic interviews with key witnesses, magic‐based tracing of everyone involved---everything reasonable had been done, and it all amounted to not much more than she had already told Nakihara‐san.

Governance was handling the traditional surveillance angle, tracing the magical girls back to their arrival on planet, and before, with assistance from MSY investigators. Others were working to try to trace them afterwards.

What was their field team even supposed to do?

The local team lead, Montalcini, got Simona up to speed on that.

\"And finally we have a team---you---that will be trying to analyze the squid angle of things directly,\" Montalcini said. \"That means working tightly together with the military, who are organizing a substantial ground assault on the aliens. Your goal will be to get ahead of the shifting front and access alien databanks before they\'re wiped in the enemy\'s retreat. As specialists, you won\'t be asked to take frontline combat roles, but it will still be far from safe.\"

An audible and telepathic murmur passed through the dozen or so magical girls that had gathered there. They had been told about potential danger before they arrived, and that they might end up near the combat lines, but they hadn\'t been told *this*.

\"I know what you\'re thinking, this is all a bit sudden, and why are we pushing so hard on alien intel gathering? The truth is, the Far Seers were consulted on the matter, and they\'ve told us that we need to be more aggressive about gathering information from the aliens. So, that\'s what we\'ll do. Local Command is more than happy to cooperate, given the additional resources we\'ve brought in system; they\'re sick of the stalemate on this planet.\"

Mina Montalcini was playing it a bit cute, Simona thought. She was a member of the Cult\'s Theological Council, which overlapped membership with the Far Seers, and the two had recently entered into a certain partnership. In all likelihood she had been involved in the \"intel\" gathering herself. But why was Simona being included in---

\"Del Mago,\" Mina said, interrupting her thought.

\"Yes?\"

\"You\'re probably wondering why you\'re here and not with the team tracing Akemi\'s magical girls. The answer is that our lead work has shown traces of those magical girls all over the front lines. Given that, Chitose suggested you be on hand for this, especially since you have some squid combat experience.\"

That wasn\'t the most complete of reasons, but Simona could read between the lines. Yuma thought, for whatever reason, that investigating the squid would be the most productive direction. She also wanted to see if Simona could behave, and wouldn\'t mourn her terribly much if she got killed.

Probably.

\"I understand,\" she said.

Mina gave her a look, and after a moment the telepathy started. She didn\'t even bother trying to hide it from the others.

*There\'s more to it than that,* Mina thought.

*I thought as much,* Simona replied. *But what can\'t be said out loud to the rest of the group? Do we fear our communications could be compromised?*

*There are two factions capable of that,* Mina thought, staring at her rigidly. *One of them, Akemi\'s group, has already been here, and it is impossible to hide that we are trying to trace them.*

A short rhetorical pause.

*The other one though, the TCF terrorists... they\'re here now, and we would prefer they not find out we\'re onto them. Our surveillance telepaths have picked up some glimmers, and we think they\'re heading for the front too. We can only speculate why.*

*But why does that recommend me?* Simona thought. *I have a connection to Akemi, not the terrorists.*

*Akemi trusted you to operate independently when the TCF conspiracy was at its strongest. Yet even now, she won\'t work with the Task Force or the Church. Feels worthwhile to have you on board, then, don\'t you think?*

*I won\'t argue with that,* Simona thought. *Is there anything else?*

*Nothing else,* Mina thought.

She paused, her eyes resting on Simona for the interim. There was definitely* something else.

*Well, I* have *been wondering if I could persuade you to join our Church,* she thought finally. *After all, I hear that amidst the great public debate over the veracity of our Goddess\'s recent visions, you\'ve been clearheaded enough to understand that they\'re real.*

Simona peered into the other woman\'s dark eyes. Unlike most of them, Mina was aged into her twenties, perhaps as a reflection of her leadership role, both on this mission and in the Cult. Simona considered herself good at reading people, but wasn\'t surprised to find the much older woman inscrutable.

Was the woman being entirely honest with her? And even if she wasn\'t, did it matter? Simona wanted to be where the action was and, as far as she could tell, Montalcini wanted her there too.

It felt strange to consider, but she would have preferred Nakihara be with her as well. Even unreliable allies were useful, and Asami must have had experience deflecting Cult solicitations. They\'d become rather more aggressive lately. Unfortunately, Nakihara had done her the disfavor of proving too crucial to the war effort to risk on the ground.

*Your goddess is at least right about Ryouko still being alive, I\'ll give her that. But I don\'t think Ryouko would appreciate my joining the Cult, especially considering the religious treatment she\'s starting to receive from some of its members. I\'m grateful for your trust in me on this mission, but when it comes to the Cult, I must decline.*

*Well, I\'m hoping Shizuki\'s opinion will eventually change on that, in the Goddess\'s own time. In the meantime, I\'m sure we\'ll work well together.*

\"I won\'t disappoint you,\" Simona said out loud.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simona would be traveling to the front with three other Task Force agents, all three with powers directly relevant to the task at hand. Maria de León was a clairvoyant whose powers were similar to those of Kuroi Kana---that is, she could see the past, but in this case only when touching an object connected to that past, particularly dead bodies.

Maria would be the likely star of their investigative efforts, but Patricia von Rohr provided magic hacking and electronic forensics, and Arya Death rounded out the set as their teleporter, capable of a reasonable mix of distance and fast reset time.

She... knew Patricia, of course, but she viewed that as only a good thing. They had worked together before. The other details didn\'t matter.

There was one additional consideration: because of the risk of encountering the TCF conspiracy on this mission, a soul mage took a moment to link their soul gems to a small magical token, a keychain‐sized Incubator plush that Yuma had been working on for long‐range communication. In the event of any kind of compromise---an intrusive mind‐read, for instance---it would trigger a distress pulse. It could also be used for normal communication.

Simona wasn\'t sure if she hoped she would need it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For all that Simona prided herself on her unflappable experience, she simply wasn\'t a specialist in ground combat against aliens. Far from it, in fact---she lacked the basic ground training that all magical girls her age had gone through, with only her recent space training for the jumpstrike mission to point to. That was still months of simulated combat, but it wasn\'t *quite* the same.

Most of their recent Task Force training had focused on combat against human* forces, especially magical girls, given the threat of the TCF conspiracy.

So she had to admit a bit of nervousness as they mounted into their personnel carrier, eyeing the shimmering active camouflage armor and drone ports as she entered. Ground combat was notorious for chewing up inexperienced magical girls---the Magi Cæli had more bodyloss, but better gem recovery rates---and Simona didn\'t exactly fancy having her gem shattered by artillery as her broken body sank slowly into the mud. There were nearby clairvoyants on constant lookout, and they could teleport out as a squad at the drop of a hat, but still, nothing was foolproof.

This is only while still in the rear, she reminded herself. They would travel on foot or by teleporter for all the parts that mattered, including the approach to the front itself. Even if an alien drone spotted them, even if an artillery strike gutted their vehicle, there was no way they\'d still be there by the time it reached them. At the moment, there was simply no need to spend teleporter resources moving in their own safe zones.

And if something else happened, perhaps with the magical girls of the TCF conspiracy, then the magic on their soul gems would alert a teleportation backup squad instantly---even a lost connection would draw them in, like a dead man\'s switch.

She took a moment to review the mission in her mind.

In accordance with their given directives, local Command had put together a plan for a set‐piece offensive, taking advantage of a weakness in the alien line to gain ground and help the Task Force grab whatever intel they could. Here, the aliens had anchored their flanks on a pair of natural barriers---a major mountain range on their right, and a large patch of swampland on the left. The aliens avoided over‐relying on terrain when possible, given the prevalence of magical girl‐based tricks, but here they were constrained on resources---and the humans had thus far not committed that many magical girls.

For what they wanted, a simple teleportation‐based spec ops raid might have sufficed, but such a straightforward approach had led to mishaps in the past. The aliens weren\'t shy about bombarding their own command bunkers if they thought it could eliminate a magical girl team. It would be safer to conduct it as part of a larger operation.

The aliens were right to fear relying on terrain. While the human military\'s specialist ground clearers were rare, dependent on highly specific magical powers, they very much got the job done, turning even the worst terrain into reasonably laid out corridors of advance. Montalcini herself would be filling that role here, using her water‐based powers to make the swamps passable before the aliens realized the threat.

It took a lot to achieve an offensive like this. The kinds of force concentration necessary were often all too easily spotted, and columns of advancing units were juicy targets for all manner of artillery, air, and even subterranean power. A JIT teleportation relay could make the first problem easier, but otherwise it was by now a very old problem.

Simona\'s part in all that seemed comparatively minor. She and the rest of the team would wait in the staging area and teleport in only when alien resources were sufficiently stretched and local communications were sufficiently disrupted. There, at the preidentified sector command bunker, they would strip everything they could from the local servers and personnel, relying on a hefty dose of magic.

The vehicle began moving with a slight rumble, rolling across the landscape as fast as the terrain allowed, following the roads laid out through a series of low rolling hills, with a missile launcher or artillery emplacement hidden behind seemingly every rise. The swamps were still quite a ways away, beyond their frontline fortifications.

Everything was quiet, everyone wrapped up in their thoughts or pre‐combat preparation in the darkness of their armored vehicle, which lacked transparent viewing panels. In addition to the four Task Force agents, there were two human Spec Ops members to help coordinate, eyes glassy as their minds wandered their command interfaces.

Eventually, they rendezvoused with their combat escort as they entered the inner human defense lines. This was two additional vehicles of soldiers, assigned to give them cover.

She finally let out her breath when the vehicle rolled to a stop and the walls unfurled around them, letting them jump out. She consoled herself that her TacComp had yet to suggest emotional suppression, which would have been quite embarrassing before entering any actual combat.

They had a few moments to gather themselves, concealed within a grove of fast‐growing local vine‐trees, still relevant to combat despite all the technology on both sides. The rumbling in the distance made it clear that the operation had already started, though they could only track its progress through their uplink to local Command. Things were going well---it was time to move.

Arya, their teleporter, summoned a polearm and slammed it into the ground, a violet circle shimmering around them for a moment. Around them, similar effects surrounded their combat escort.

It would take two jumps to reach their destination, but their teleporter only needed to pause in between for a short while, just long enough for them to observe one of the protected staging grounds, a trio of mobile artillery pieces billowing with ozone smoke as they shelled distant targets, underneath the green protective shell of a barrier generator. That girl waved at them, reminding her uncomfortably of Ryouko.

She had to reflect: Would Ryouko have been nervous on a mission such as this? Of course not.

Then they were there. The command bunker was already mostly cleared by an army teleportation squad, and when the circle around them faded and she could move freely again, they found themselves in a dome‐like room filled with terminals and wall‐sized holographic displays. Bits and pieces of smoldering alien remains lay scattered around the room, though two aliens remained intact, bathed in a pale yellow light that she immediately registered as an unfamiliar magic.

But their local status updates made clear something unexpected had happened: the advance team had apparently arrived in the middle of the aliens fighting *each other*, with most of the aliens already dead and the remainder self‐destructing, except for two bodies that a magical girl had managed to catch in a stasis field.

It happened sometimes for the squid to attack each other. Typically, they didn\'t hesitate to eliminate their own if they thought they were magically compromised. But of course, there had been no magical girls yet in the area to do such a thing---or there shouldn\'t have been.

*You\'re finally here!* a girl thought, not moving from her position near the doorway. *We need your postcognitive clairvoyant. We were trying to contact you, but with so much interference on the comms...*

Patricia moved to aid her counterpart with some of the alien electronics, but it was clear who needed the most help. Even as Maria moved to crouch over the alien bodies, Simona put a hand on her shoulder, infusing her with the orange glow of her enhancing magic.

Simona closed her eyes, allowing herself to be fed a memory stream of the past, though in this case as a black and white tableau with dramatic shadows and exaggerated movement. It reminded her of film noir, and it was very odd to see Cephalopods depicted in this way.

The aliens notoriously never expressed emotion, but if it was possible to guess from gesture alone, the aliens in the memory were agitated, or definitely very surprised, if the wild gesticulation could be taken at face value. Maria expressed surprise at the behavior---so it wasn\'t just a quirk of the vision, then.

Maria frowned, her brow wrinkling, and Simona watched as the girl strained to reach through time and metaphysics, strands of magic spooling and unspooling around the aliens\' bodies. Simona boosted her power further; scrying the past was directly entropy‐defying and very difficult.

Then the vision advanced, the door to the room sliding open. A series of explosions rocked the memory, followed by a torrent of lasers. It seemed the base had been rigged to blow, but the attacking aliens had deployed forcefields that contained most of the blasts. The aliens inside the room took casualties but retreated to cover where they could, returning fire and inflicting casualties in return. Some of them moved between cover points, burying their laser cutters into the electronics around them as they went, melting everything they touched.

Before they could finish, both sides in the alien firefight reeled as the human advance team teleported in. The defending side didn\'t even bother trying to fight, detonating on the spot, while the attacking side was quickly killed, with two bodies caught in a magical girl\'s stasis field---which brought them back to the present.

Maria shook her head.

*I don\'t know if I believe it, but it\'s my own magic, and the imagery is pretty clear. None of that really made any sense, given how we know the aliens to behave. More likely magic was involved here. Someone other than us. But the strange thing is, if the aliens here had been magically compromised, the magic should have shown up in the vision as color. That\'s how my visions work.*

Simona put a fist to her mouth, considering the matter for a few moments, while Maria did as well.

*No, I think I trust my magic,* Maria thought. *There weren\'t any other magical girls involved. The squid must have made a mistake, and wrongly concluded the alien command staff here were compromised. Our advance team was only moments away, after all, subversion was plausible.*

*I wouldn\'t rule out the possibility of deliberate inter‐alien violence,* Simona thought, shaking her head. *Not just cleaning house on potential magical compromise, I mean. If you believe Nakihara\'s vision, there are differences within the Cephalopods. But this is speculation.*

*There\'s something else worth talking about,* Patricia thought, interjecting into their conversation for the first time. *The remnants of this bunker\'s servers are full of surveillance data on Medes and local human activity, collected by stealth satellites we apparently haven\'t noticed. They\'ve been watching us carefully both before and after the raid on the grief cube logistics site, seemingly without any interest in the battlefield itself. They even had a special monitor for certain individuals---mostly local leadership, but the list includes an unusual entry that I\'m pretty sure is Kuroi Abe.*

There was an active silence on their telepathy channel for a few seconds, especially after they started to review Patricia\'s files. There was nothing crazy about the aliens monitoring human activity, of course, but they tended to stick to items of military importance. A lot of what was being tracked was far more mundane than the aliens typically bothered with, and the surveillance assets used would have had far more military utility simply watching the battlefield for attacks like the one they had just launched.

*Are we done here, then?* Maria asked Patricia. *You seem to have everything.*

*We\'ve just finished collecting the surviving physical hardware for analysis,* Patricia said, holding up a sealed preservation canister---the Spec Ops behind her were carrying more.

*Let\'s get out of here before they nuke the place,* Ayra thought, readying her teleportation magic. *The squid know damn well how important intelligence is.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There wasn\'t time for Simona to really consider the situation until they were already on their way back, away from the main combat formations, who would hopefully manage to continue their good progress. A while later, they exited the danger zone, and their combat escort peeled away and returned to the front, leaving them motoring alone through the rear. Soon, the swamp dropped away, replaced by a series of low hills.

She found it hard to stay focused, her thoughts seeming to slip away from her repeatedly. She should have been relieved---the mission had been a success. Yet she even resorted to contacting Asami through their Incubator plush for some discussion. Maybe it would help her think.

*So they really are targeting Ryouko\'s family,* Asami thought, telepathy beaming all the way down from her perch in orbit. *But why? It doesn\'t make any sense.*

*It makes a bit more sense if you factor in the TCF conspiracy, but why would* they *care about Kuroi Abe?* Simona thought. *Especially now that Ryouko isn\'t even here. We\'re missing something, I think.*

*It\'s always been strange that the aliens attacked Ryouko on the* HSS Laplace, before *she became the Hero of Orpheus,* Asami thought. *They killed her grandmother before that, too. Did the TCF conspiracy just predict Ryouko would be that important? Either way, I don\'t like the idea that the squid are obsessed with her to the point they\'d target her relatives. Is she really going to be okay, so deep in their territory?*

*She\'ll be fine,* Simona thought, feeling an uncharacteristic pain pounding in her temples.

She allowed her focus to drift, even as they said their goodbyes and closed the channel. Her first adventure out into ground combat had been more productive than they had any reason to expect, other than Far Seers meddling, but it still wasn\'t clear just *what* they had gotten from it. Some more tantalizing hints, but no real contact or clues. But---

A pulse of energy in her soul gem, daggers at the very core of her being.

Her world shot back into focus, and she realized someone was trying to listen in on her thoughts.

The other magical girls realized an instant before she did, and the call for help back to the other team should have already been on its way. In less than a minute---

Their personnel carrier lurched to a bone‐crunching stop, and while they were still jumbled into the front of the vehicle, using shards of emergency telekinesis to cushion themselves, a series of sharp green vines* smashed through the floor in a hail of shattered armor and spalling that should have been instantly lethal to all occupants.

Maria dropped to the floor, briefly exhausted by the wave of protective shielding she had summoned---not her primary power. Despite her exertions, one of the human Spec Ops was registering critical damage and entering fugue, and Simona had lost three of her fingers.

Simona processed that in tiny fractions of a second, but still not fast enough.

A stinging pain on her ankles announced two vines latching onto her flesh, thorns hooking themselves inward, and even as she tried to pull away, more emerged from the ground in a cloud of mud and debris, raining her flesh with metal even as they flailed at her limbs.

She shoved the pain away, pulling at the vines with direct force before further attacks could land. Around her, the smoke‐filled ruins of their vehicle choked out her vision, so that she could barely see Maria struggling with the same vines on the floor, oozing blood. She could not see where the others were, suggesting they had managed to escape. She wasn\'t sure---there was some kind of interference.

The vines began to give way with surprising ease, but before she had any time to reflect on that, she felt a pulse of magic jolt into her from below. Even as she tried to react, it surged into her soul gem, ripping at *something* in her mind so quickly it left her reeling, world spinning.

But she\'d incorporated the anti‐magic powers she\'d manifested at the pulsar into her telepathic defenses. A reflexive, desperate burst of magic broke her free, both of the vines and whatever telepathic attack it was channeling.

By then, she had managed to gain *some* of her bearings. She needed to get Maria free---the girl had burned most of her energy saving the team. But there was some kind of magic field around Simona, blocking her ability to communicate or even detect the others. It was also blocking the distress beacon that should have been wired into their soul gems, and* mimicking their telepathic signal, circumventing the dead man\'s switch. A stunt like that couldn\'t last long---but it didn\'t have to. Whoever had done this was coordinated and powerful.

The thing about magic---there were always loopholes.

Immediately, she stuck out her hand---grimacing at the bloody stumps where fingers had been---and pumped a pulse of magic into the Incubator figurine on Maria\'s body. If she could just amplify the signal...

*There*, and easier than she had expected. A quick burst of anti‐magic freed Maria from her vines as well. Now they just needed to survive long enough for help to arrive.

That was easier said than done. She pushed aside some of the smoke with a puff of telekinesis, peering past the remnants of their vehicle, now strewn in pieces within the burning brush. It was strange already that she hadn\'t experienced a follow‐up attack, and now it became clear that the others had been holding the enemy off.

She saw no sign of the human foes she had expected. Instead, peering into the forest nearby, she could only see a squadron of drones, about a dozen rotary‐wing fliers flitting in and out of the trees, just barely within human sight range. They should have been easy pickings for magical girls, but all the drones showed clear signs of magic assistance, detectable even through the interference. As she watched, one of them blinked fifty feet to her right, evading a fusillade of violet beams. One of the others began exuding visible pulses of red light, pure force energy tearing through Patricia\'s drones.

Her squad was suffering from the surprise attack---Patricia had lost an arm somehow, wound sealed off by her body, and the fugued human Spec Ops lay in pieces nearby. Simona couldn\'t even see where the other one was.

Simona dove to the side, hiding herself behind a piece of metal just as another vine shot out of the ground.

How was this happening? Were the drones and the vines and the telepathy the produce of a drone‐specialist magical girl? She had never seen one so powerful. This must be like the drones in the recording Homura had left in Argentina---each one operated by a different magical girl, somehow. They had planned for the possibility, but hadn\'t planned on being outnumbered three‐to‐one.

Simona stabbed the barrel of her sniper rifle through the cover in front of her, digging into her soul for the required power. Simulation training had proven anti‐magic was her best shot against other magical girls, as long as she achieved some measure of surprise.

It just required a little focus and time. She hoped she had enough power in her soul gem to make a difference. It wouldn\'t do to underestimate.

A vine tore out of the ground below her and grappled her torso, sinking thorns an inch deep into her belly and back. She ignored it.

She emptied as much magic out of her soul gem as she dared, leaving only a bare trickle to keep herself alive. There was no point in holding back; the cavalry should be on its way, and she would only have the element of surprise once. But she would be leaving herself dangerously vulnerable afterward---if the drones were not *entirely* dependent on magic, for example, and had some simple explosives as backup. Or if some of them simply escaped her attack.

But right now, even a bad plan was better than no plan.

With a high‐pitched whine, a blinding orange light flared out of her rifle, crossing almost instantly the distance to the attacking drones. Bursting like a firework, it filled the area with a dazzling and searing array of crisscrossing beams, keenly targeted. Was the area a hundred meters? Two hundred? Three? She wasn\'t sure; she hadn\'t calibrated.

The vines scourging her flesh flickered and vanished, and her combat net came immediately back online, as did her missing telepathic connection with the other magical girls. The interference, at least, was gone.

But as the light faded and she noted with relief that some of the enemy drones had fallen from the sky, trailing smoke into the brush, she felt herself being slammed down into the ground with massive force.

She couldn\'t understand what was going on. It didn\'t hurt, not exactly, not yet, but with her face in the dirt and a full blast of magical force crushing her body, filling her eyes with painful red, she didn\'t have the resources left to resist, or seize control back or... do anything, really. She could barely even think enough to despair, and none of her implants were responding.

*Not... so hot after all, was I? Is this... really how it\'s going to end? What a joke I was.*

*Incoming,* Maria thought, telepathy distant with emotional suppression.

Incoming... what?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It took long seconds for her to realize she was free---she had lost track of time.

But as her vision clarified and she reclaimed her senses---observing incredulously that she was not dead---she realized that the cavalry had indeed arrived, and that someone was pumping a wave of healing magic into her body, and had been for a while.

*Did we get them?* she thought.

*Depends what you mean by \'get\',* the healer thought. *You fried about six of the drones, follow‐up artillery got a few, but the rest were able to teleport out shortly after we arrived, along with the remains. Nothing left to study. Arya is dead; it\'s possible she was deliberately targeted first. Both Spec Ops will survive.*

Simona sat up, digesting the information as the healer moved on to one of the others. She spotted Meiqing walking over, and tilted her head to acknowledge her.

*They didn\'t get very much intel from me,* Simona thought, now that she finally had the time to check her own telepathic damage. *I\'ve got that going for me, at least.*

Meiqing made a face.

*Maria\'s certain they pulled a good deal from Arya. At least it wasn\'t a one‐way street, which it would have been if you all died, so your heroics mattered. Patricia and our soul mage were both able to get a sense of the drones. There was a ghost in those machines.*

*I\'m glad my heroics are measured in terms of how much intel I gather, Simona thought, straining to pull herself together. *I think I mean that, actually. But what are you saying about the drones? I know they were operated by enemy magical girls, I understood Homura\'s warning.*

*Homura didn\'t warn us the drones would have soul gems inside.*
